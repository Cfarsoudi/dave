          INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm
          room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting
          patiently for this year's kids.
          A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,
          right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.
          They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.
          She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just
          above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.
          No parents.
          She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the
          other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring
          through the building's window at...
          Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their
          parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.

          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

          Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT
          smiles up at her.

                         SARA
          Hi. Sara Matthews.
          She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
          silver chain around her neck.

          R.A.
          Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover
          country.
          She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.

          R.A.
          You're in room three-sixteen.
          Welcome.
          She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...
          Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down
          the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps
          into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.
          Sara stops in front of Room 316.

          INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY

          She opens the door and looks in on:
          A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the
          hall; twin beds. Heaven.
          Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
          here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.
          She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.
          First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her
          duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a
          YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.
          Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.
          It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.

                         SARA
          Told you we'd make it.
          She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
          the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles
          off the other cart.

                         GIRL
          Sorry! Bad driver.
          Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
          clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And
          peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl
          smiles sheepishly.

                         GIRL
          In case of emergency.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm Tracy.

                         SARA
          Sara.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

          A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it
          all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on
          the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm
          windows.

          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.

                         SARA
          Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met
          this really cool biker? He's taking
          me to Mexico this weekend.

                         (BEAT)
          Hello?

                         (BEAT)
          Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.
          Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
          work/study ad on the wall.

                         SARA
          Everything's great.

                         (BEAT)
          No, she's not here yet so I got to
          choose my side of the room.
          She tears a tab off the flyer.

          EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT

          Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm.

          INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is
          peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.
          She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair
          photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.
          A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it
          expectantly to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All
          dressed to party.

                         TRACY
          Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.

                         SARA
          Psi U.?

                         TRACY
          They're a frat. Beer... guys...

                         SARA
          I don't know... I might just hang
          and wait for my roommate.
          Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
          lip, considering. She smiles.

                         SARA
          Alright. Just let me change.
          The girls cheer.

          EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a
           giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the
          front door. Music blasts out of the windows.

          INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the
          head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a

          FRAT BOUNCER.

                         BOUNCER
          (motions to a crowded keg)
          If you want beer, I'll need ID's.

                         TRACY
          For a frat party?! Seriously?
          He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
          steps around him.

                         KIM
          I don't drink anyway.
          Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         BOUNCER
          There's punch and non-alcoholic
          beer over there...
          He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is
          around it.
          Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.

                         TRACY
          Come on, just us. We won't tell.
          The bouncer is tempted but not budging.

                         BOUNCER
          Honestly, I'm just a pledge.
          They'll kick me out.
          She stomps by him.

                         TRACY
          Wuss.
          Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.

                         TRACY
          You want something to drink?

                         SARA
          What's the point?
          Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking
          extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.
          Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,
          but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large
          room.
          A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,
          but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and
          watches them. In particular --
          THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's
          mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara
          chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He
          definitely stands out.
          Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
          with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.
          Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the
          wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         TRACY
          (yells over the music)
          Why aren't you dancing?

                         SARA
          To this?

                         TRACY
          They're not that bad.
          Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
          jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as
          Tracy chugs her drink.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

          A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with
          others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her
          shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub
          it out.

                         SARA
          Crap.
          Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.

                         SARA
          Where's Tracy?

                         KIM
          She was getting more punch.
          Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
          onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other
          girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,
          egging on the crowd.

                         SARA
          Uh oh.
          Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera
          phones stretch out above the crowd.

                         SARA

                         (SHOUTS)
          Tracy.
          Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the
          stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the
          bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         SARA

                         (LOUDER)
          Tracy. Don't.
          Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who
          inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara
          gasps.

                         STEPHEN
          Damn!
          Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
          Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.

                         STEPHEN
          Oh. Woops.

                         SARA

                         (ANNOYED)
          I have to go clean this up.
          She turns.

                         STEPHEN
          Looks like my plan backfired.
          Sara turns back towards him.

                         SARA
          What plan?

                         STEPHEN
          To spill beer on you so I can start
          a conversation.

                         SARA
          You spilled beer on me purposely?

                         STEPHEN

                         (NODS)
          You pissed?
          She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
          hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a
          dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.

                         SARA
          I'll get over it.
          He laughs, making her smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         SARA
          I'm not sure how she's so wasted.
          All she's had is punch.
          Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.

                         STEPHEN
          Come on.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR

          Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of
          the punch.

                         SARA
          It's pretty good.
          She drinks some more.

                         SARA
          It doesn't taste that strong.

                         STEPHEN
          Exactly.
          He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
          hers.

                         STEPHEN
          Stephen. By the way.

                         SARA
          Sara.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER

          Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup.
          Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs,
          grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,
          bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that
          he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her
          other hand.

                         SARA
          Hey, why do you get to drink beer?

                         STEPHEN
          Twenty-one.

                         SARA
          Old man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         STEPHEN
          Tell me about it. My back is
          killing me.
          They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against
          his chest.

                         STEPHEN
          Besides, frat brothers don't have
          to wear those ugly wristbands.

                         SARA
          Ugh. You're in this frat?
          He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people
          behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing,
          Holding up a cup of punch.

                         KIM

                         (SLURS)
          Did you try the punch? It's pretty
          good.

                         SARA
          What happened to Tracy?
          Kim shrugs.

                         KIM
          I'm the worst roommate ever.
          Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which
          Stephen notices.

                         STEPHEN
          Do you want to look for your
          friend?
          Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods.

          INT. STAIRCASE

          They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom
          of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys
          stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.

                         SARA

                         (BUTTS IN)
          I got her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she
          looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat
          boys notice her struggling.

                         FRAT BOY #1
          Who's got you?
          Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor...
          But Stephen's there to catch her.

                         STEPHEN
          Guess that would be me.
          But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.

                         SARA
          Who's got you?
          Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around
          Sara's waist.

                         STEPHEN

                         (SMIRKS)
          Apparently God.
          Sara rolls her eyes.

          INT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT

          Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby. Sara
          wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and
          ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.

                         KIM
          Thanks Sara.

                         SARA
          No problem.
          They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into
          the elevator. Holding it for Sara.

                         KIM
          You want us to wait?
          Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the
          doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         STEPHEN
          You know, I'm going to be pulling
          kitchen duty all week for helping
          girls leave a frat party. It's
          like opposite everything we stand
          for.
          Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but
          her lips still very close to his.

                         SAEA
          (low and romantic)
          Does that make it worth it?

                         STEPHEN
          Honestly, no.
          She laughs out loud.

                         SARA
          Do you want to come up?

                         STEPHEN

                         (DEEP BREATH)
          More than I can tell you, but that
          wouldn't be fair.
          Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her.

                         STEPHEN
          Keep it... till next time.

                         SARA
          Thanks again. For everything.

                         (BEAT)
          And, sorry about kitchen duty.
          He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after
          him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which
          suddenly makes her a little more queasy.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.
          She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then
          opens it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. ROOM 316 - NIGHT

          Sara closes the door behind her. Almost pitch black; just a
          little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her
          lounge chair.

                         SARA
          Ow!
          She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing
          hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may
          puke at any second.
          She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her
          bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:
          The other bed.
          Sara screams.

                         GIRL
          Hi.
           FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and
          disorienting Sara.

                         SARA
          Who are you?!

                         GIRL
          Rebecca. Your roommate.
          Sara calms, catching on.

                         SARA
          What are you doing?

                         REBECCA
          Taking your picture.

                         SARA
          Why?
          Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.

                         SARA
          Oh shit.
          Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca
          smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER

          Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room,
          holding her head. The door is slightly open.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          It's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her
          eyes are closed.

                         SARA

                         (WHISPERS)
          Rebecca?
          No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it,
          and turns toward the wall.
          Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go
          to sleep.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

          It's the middle of the day and students carry their books
          everywhere.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through
          the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see...
          Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
          light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
          Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
          flank an awesome stereo system.
          Rebecca sees that Sara's awake.

                         REBECCA
          Hey Sara.
          Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened
          last night? Rebecca smiles.

                         REBECCA
          We met last night.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         SARA
          Right...
          (racking her brain)
          Starts with a... "T"?

                         REBECCA
          Close. Rebecca.
          She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.

                         REBECCA
          Come on. It'll help, trust me.
          Sara washes down the aspirin.

                         SARA
          Thanks.
          Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched.

                         SARA

                         (SUDDENLY PANICKED)
          I didn't throw up on you, did I?

                         REBECCA

                         (LAUGHS)
          No. You made it to the bathroom.
          Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved
          to her side.
          Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various
          self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca
          is staring straight back at us. No smile.

                         SARA
          Did you do those?
          Rebecca nods.

                         SARA
          They're really cool.

                         REBECCA
          I just like capturing my moods.
          A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night
          before are coming back to her now.

                         SARA
          Rebecca -- did you take my picture
          last night?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         REBECCA

                         (LAUGHING)
          Yeah. It's just something I do. For
          my drawings.

                         (BEAT)
          C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The
          walk will help your head.
          Sara rolls over, groaning.

                         SARA
          It's too damn early for me.

                         REBECCA
          It's three in the afternoon.
          Sara's eyes bug out.

                         SARA
          Holy shit!

          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

          Sara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks.
          All look used and worn. Fashion Design. Psychology. Calculus.
          She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as
          another GIRL reaches too. They both pull back, neither sure
          who has claim to it.

                         GIRL
          So what do we do?
          Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.

                         SARA
          Nice bag. Dior?

                         GIRL

                         (FLATTERED)
          Yeah.
          Sara snatches the book.

                         SARA
          I'm on financial aid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER

          Sara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the
          stuff she needs. Sara scans Rebecca's books. They're all
          art books, shiny and new.
          Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: "JASON".
          She sighs. Her finger hovers over the "talk" button. A beat.
          She hits it right before it goes to voicemail.

                         SARA

                         (ANNOYED)
          Jason. What are you doing?

          JASON (O.S.)
          I just wanted to hear your voice.

                         SARA
          I told you not to do this.

          JASON (O.S.)
          I need to talk to you.

                         SARA
          You're just making it harder.

          JASON (O.S.)
          Sara, listen I... I want to come
          out there.

                         SARA

                         (SNAPS)
          But you didn't come out here,
          remember. That's the problem.
          She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her.

                         SARA (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETER)
          I've gotta go.
          Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered.

                         REBECCA
          That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?

                         SARA
          Ex.
          Off Rebecca's confused look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         SARA
          It's complicated.
          A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up.
          They walk along the stacks of books.

                         SARA
          We dated since tenth grade and were
          supposed to go to college together.

                         (BEAT)
          We both applied to Brown. I got in;
          he got wait-listed. I stuck to our
          agreement and we both committed
          here. Then two weeks ago...a spot
          opened up at Brown ...and..

                         REBECCA
          No?! He took it?
          (Sara nods glumly)
          What an asshole.

                         SARA
          Yep.

                         REBECCA
          Do you miss him?

                         SARA
          Sometimes I think I do.

                         REBECCA
          It's hard to let go.

                         (SMILES)
          Believe me, I know. But, you're in
          college now. A girl's gotta move
          on.
          Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her
          phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the
          register.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books
          away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices
          something out of the corner of her eye.

                         SARA
          Oh my God.

                         REBECCA
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one
          side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER

          COLLECTION.

                         SARA
          I am so jealous.

                         REBECCA
          I know... I've got a lot of clothes.
          Mind if I put some on your side?

                         SARA
          No problem.

                         REBECCA
          Borrow anything you want. Really. I
          haven't worn half of them.
          Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.
          Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some
          still carry their price tags.

                         SARA
          Jesus, some of these I've only ever
          seen in Vogue.

                         REBECCA
          My parents idea of bonding is to
          turn me loose in Beverly Hills with
          a Platinum card.

                         SARA
          Oh, you here?

                         REBECCA
          Pasadena.
          Off Sara's confused look.

                         REBECCA (CONT'D)
          About 20 minutes away.

                         SARA
          That's cool. You can go home on
          weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.

                         REBECCA
          Not gonna happen.
          Sara gives her a puzzled stare.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         REBECCA
          It's a long story.. .Let's just say
          nothing's free in my house.
          She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods
          at Rebecca's drawing pad.

                         SARA
          Can I take a look?
          She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.

                         REBECCA
          No.
          Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came
          across pretty harsh.

                         REBECCA
          Not till it's done. Nothing
          personal. It's just my... process.

                         (SMILES)
          I wouldn't want to show you
          anything unless it was perfect.

                         SARA

                         (SMILES BACK)
          Sure.

          EXT. CAFETERIA - DUSK

          Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DUSK

          Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner.

                         REBECCA
          I thought you were a design major.
          Why are you taking Calc and
          psychology?
          The girls get up with their trays.

                         SARA
          (with a smirk)
          I am. I want to be well-rounded.
          (off her look)
          And they're requirements.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          TRACY (O.S.)
          Hey Sara.
          Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks
          over, but Rebecca doesn't follow.

                         SARA
          Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my
          roommate, Rebecca.
          She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves
          her over.
          Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.

                         REBECCA
          Hi.

                         TRACY
          RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can
          we call you?

                         KIM
          How 'bout Reba?
          Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.

                         SARA
          I like Becca.
          Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.

                         TRACY
          How 'bout Becky?

                         SARA
          Becky's good.
          The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.

                         REBECCA
          I like Rebecca.
          Buzzkill.

                         TRACY

          OOOKAAAY.
          Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          EXT. DESIGN BUILDING - DAY

          Sara enters the Design building.

          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          Sara peeks in the open door of a classroom. Frustration in
          her eyes -- the class she couldn't get into.
          She watches PROFESSOR ROBERTS -- long-haired, dashing --
          lecture his students.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          So... here we are. Design 101. And
          each one of you is asking yourself
          the same question...
          (he taps his own chest)
          Who is this guy? Why should I turn
          off my Blackberry and pay attention
          to him?
          Mild laughter from the class.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'll tell you why -- because I hold
          the keys to the kingdom. Think of
          your favorite designers. Marc
          Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.
          Magicians, right? I've got news for
          you: All of their magic stems from
          the same source: the fundamental
          principles of design.

                         (BEAT)
          I can teach you those principles.
          He lets the power of his words sink in.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          The journey to the catwalks of New
          York... Paris... Tokyo... starts
          right here, in this room. And all
          you have to do is open your minds.
          Man, she wants in.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. SAME HALLWAY - LATER

          Sara stands by the door, watching the students file out. As
          the last one leaves, she screws up her courage and walks in.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Professor Roberts is gathering up his papers.

                         SARA
          Professor Roberts?
          He flashes a disarming smile.

                         SARA
          I'm sorry to bother you, it's
          just...

                         (BEAT)
          I absolutely must take this class.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'm afraid we're full. But don't
          worry -- Intro Design has three
          other sections.

                         SARA
          But you're not teaching them. I
          want to learn from the best.
          He smiles at her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          What's your name?

                         SARA
          Sara Matthews.

                         (BEAT)
          I brought a request form.
           She holds it out to him. He takes the form, but his eyes stay
          on Sara. Roaming over her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign
          your request form when I've turned
          down a dozen others? Would that be
          fair?
          Sara's face falls. A long beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         SARA
          No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks
          anyway.
          She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          But...

                         (SHE TURNS)
          Who said life was fair? You happen
          to have two things I can't teach...
          He walks to her... and hands her the signed form.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Style. And Desire.
          He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches
          the form to her chest, smiling.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara and Rebecca sit on their respective beds. Rebecca
          listens to her Walkman. Sara types on her laptop.

                         SARA
          Hey.
          Rebecca removes her earbud.

                         SARA
          What's your Facebook page? I'll add
          you as a friend.

                         REBECCA
          I don't have a Facebook page.

                         SARA
          Myspace?

                         REBECCA
          Nope. I don't spend a lot of time

                         ON-LINE
          Sara stares at Rebecca. No way.

                         SARA
          Come here.
          Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's
          shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the
          corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends.
          Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s.

                         REBECCA
          Who's she?

                         SARA
          Irene. She graduated from the Art
          Institute out here last year.

                         REBECCA

                         (INTRIGUED)
          She's an artist?

                         SARA
          A design apprentice for Marc
          Jacobs. Hey, check out these
          posts.
          Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was
          amazing"... "Milan in the Fall"... "Off to Barcelona"... etc.

                         SARA
          I mean.. .who doesn't have a
          Facebook page?!
          Rebecca laughs.

                         REBECCA
          Okay, okay. I'll get one.
          Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches
          right in.

                         TRACY
          Cancel those library plans. Guess
          who made the guest list at Rebar?

                         (BEAT)
          You guys in? I trust you have fake
          IDs?

                         SARA
          Of course.

                         REBECCA
          I don't.

                         TRACY
          Yes you do. Thanks to my badass
          self.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it
          out to her. A peace offering.
          Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her
          sketchbook.

                         REBECCA
          I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my
          scene.
          Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.

          INT. CLUB - NIGHT

          A posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with
          mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar,
          getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids.
          As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys
          check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi." Sara tries to
          ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven.

                         TRACY
          How great is this? No parents. No
          curfews.

                         SARA
          No shit!
          They clink their empty glasses in a toast.

                         SARA
          Can I?
          She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.

                         TRACY
          Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk
          about the life of the party.

                         SARA
          Don't be mean.

                         TRACY
          I'm just saying.

                         SARA
          She's just a little hard to get to
          know.

                         TRACY
          Yeah right...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          As Tracy rolls her eyes...
          The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods
          down the bar at...
          TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not
          so sure about this.

                         SARA
          What do you think?

                         TRACY
          I think...
          Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.
          Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.

                         TRACY
          We can do better.
          She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.

          INT. CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

          Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies. Having the
          time of their lives. A HANDSOME GUY moves in, his eyes on
          Tracy.
          Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.
          Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.
          Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but
          she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for
          Tracy. Where'd she go?
          She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of
          her.

          INT. CLUB - BATHROOM

          Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.

                         SARA
          Tracy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

          A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms
          against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as
          she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.

                         SARA

                         (LOUD)
          Tracy.
          She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
          hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.
          She starts walking down the street, away from the club.
          Weary and unnerved.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone
          rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.

                         REBECCA
          Hello?

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Would you accept a collect call
          from... Sara Matthews?

                         REBECCA
          Yes.
          She smiles.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No
          cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black
          soft top sits next to an ancient pump.
          Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
          sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.

          MAN (0.S.)
          Can I help you out?
          She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station
          attendant. His name tag: "Rick".
          Rebecca sizes him up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         REBECCA
          I'm fine. Just in a hurry.
          She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
          treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the
          "Full Service" sign.

                         RICK
          Just doing my job.
          She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
          gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of
          hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.

                         REBECCA
          All done.
          She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
          back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.

                         RICK
          You have a little something.
          No, she doesn't.
          He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
          cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          The hell?
          His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.

                         REBECCA
          Sorry.
          But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
          head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.

                         REBECCA (CONT'D)
          Sorry again. Rick.
          The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
          direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.
          Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.

                         RICK
          You spoiled c---
          He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She
          absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is
          still ticking up.
          He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
          and drops the still pouring nozzle.
          A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls
          out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the
          pump.

                         REBECCA
          Pussy.
          She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in
          gasoline.

          INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT

          Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
          of hot, sobering coffee.
          Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
          shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
          Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
          car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
          the door.

          INT. DINER - NIGHT

          Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth.

                         SARA
          Nice car.

                         REBECCA
          Thanks.

                         (BEAT)
          So, where's Tracy?

                         SARA
          No idea, I couldn't find her.
          Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.

                         REBECCA
          As long as I'm here... you hungry?

                         SARA
          Starved.
          Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         REBECCA
          I can't believe she ran out on you.

                         SARA
          I know. Thanks for coming.
          Rebecca looks up from the menu.

                         REBECCA
          Tracy had her shot tonight.
          Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show
          you the big city.. .the right way.
          And I promise I won't abandon you.
          Deal?
          Sara smiles.

                         SARA
          Deal.

          INT. MOCA - DAY

          Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.

                         REBECCA
          These are the modern pieces. A
          little wilder than the old stuff.
          She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
          just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.
          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".
          She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She
          buries her cell phone in her purse.
          Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.

                         SARA
          Okay, I have no idea what this is
          supposed to be.

                         REBECCA

                         (LAUGHING)
          Even I don't get that one. Come
          on, I want to show you something.

          INT. MOCA - LATER

          Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the
          background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince
          exhibition.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
          Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.
          Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
          smock.

                         REBECCA
          This is my favorite.
          Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.

                         REBECCA
          I love how he captures her
          personality through her eyes. It's
          like she really wants to help you.
          Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
          Sara to like this painting.
          Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
          Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
          actually pretty sinister.
          Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
          hopeful expression. Sara brightens.

                         SARA
          Amazing. I love it.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.
          Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.
          Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.

                         SARA
          That is so cool.

                         REBECCA
          No graffiti in Des Moines?

                         SARA
          Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy
          loves Rick." Nothing like this.
          Rebecca pulls out her camera.

                         REBECCA
          Hey, smile.
          Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.

                         SARA
          Both of us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca
          clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo
          parlor in the background.

                         REBECCA
          Now that's one "art form" I don't
          get. Needles into skin? No thanks.

                         SARA
          I have a tattoo.
          Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes
          that she's serious.

                         REBECCA
          Really?
          Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over
          her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".

                         SARA
          My older sister. She died when I
          was nine.

                         REBECCA
          Oh, I'm sorry.

                         SARA
          (pats her heart)
          This keeps her with me.

                         REBECCA
          I always wanted a sister.
          Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they
          walk down the street.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara sits on her bed in sweats, typing on her laptop. Rebecca
          sits on her own bed, glancing over at Sara as she draws.

                         SARA
          Guess who I'm listing as my
          favorite artist on my Facebook
          page?

                         (BEAT)
          Richard Prince.
          Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check
          out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book,
          favorite band, etc.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         REBECCA

                         (LAUGHING)
          Your favorite movie is "Coyote
          Ugly"?

                         SARA
          Don't laugh. It's about a small
          town girl making it in the big
          city.

                         REBECCA
          Isn't every movie?!
          They both laugh.

          EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

          Sara, in shorts and warm-up jacket, runs down the sidewalk.
          Her head's on a swivel, taking in the city sights.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she
          puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.
          Satisfied.
          She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,
          anxious for Sara to come home.
          She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
          starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...
          She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of
          Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.
          She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it
          around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at
          herself in the mirror. She smiles.

          EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT

          Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten
          yards to the dorm. She catches her breath and hears a kitten.
          Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds
          a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white
          furball.

                         SARA
          Hey there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          The kitten purrs.

                         SARA
          Look at you.
          She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.

                         SARA
          No collar, baby?
          Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara quickly walks in and closes the door. Rebecca sits in
          her windowsill, drawing. Sara sits down on her own bed. She
          notices the "Coyote Ugly" poster.

                         SARA

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          Wow.

                         REBECCA
          I thought you'd like it.
          Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts
          Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her
          jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten
          jumps over to her bed. She pets it.

                         REBECCA
          Sara...

                         SARA
          I know, I know. It's stupid, and
          I've just broken about forty
          different dorm rules, and I should
          just take it to a shelter...

                         REBECCA

                         (BEAT)
          What do you want to name it?
          Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully.

                         SARA
          Really?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         REBECCA
          It'll be our secret. Just between
          us.
          Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.

                         SARA
          I named her in the elevator.
          Cuddles.
          She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.

                         SARA
          Is that my necklace?
          Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.

                         REBECCA
          Sorry. I was just trying it on.
          Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly
          takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it
          protectively.

                         SARA
          This was my sister's.

                         REBECCA
          Oh.
          Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.

                         SARA
          You can borrow anything of mine.
          Except for this. Okay? It's the
          only thing I kept of hers.
          Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.

                         REBECCA
          I'm really sorry.

                         SARA
          It's okay. You didn't know.

                         REBECCA
          Were you two close?

                         SARA
          Yeah. You're the first roommate
          I've had since she died. So, it
          feels a little odd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         REBECCA
          In a good way or a bad way?
          Sara smiles.

                         SARA
          A good way.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING

          Establishing of life at the quads.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy
          couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of
          laid-back STUDENTS and...
          One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now
          rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-
          WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in
          his world.

                         SARA

                         (TO CUSTOMER)
          You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?
          O.K. Do you know what's in that?
          The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some
          ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the
          lid, and...
          THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
          apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands
          her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...
          STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.

                         STEPHEN
          This seems like a pattern.
          Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.
          She leans in and speaks quietly.

                         SARA
          Just because I kissed you doesn't
          mean I'll let you cut in line.

                         STEPHEN
          So what does it mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          She coyly shrugs.

                         STEPHEN
          Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon
          are reviving a sacred tradition
          tonight.
          Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.

                         STEPHEN
          We're having another keg party.

                         SARA
          I.. dunno. I'm still having
          flashbacks from the last one.
          Sara laughs.

                         STEPHEN
          You know what? How about if I use
          you as my excuse not to go.
          Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks
          through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A
          television plays in the background.

                         TRACY
          Hey.
          Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.

                         SARA
          Hey.

                         TRACY
          Psi U. tonight?

                         SARA
          So you can ditch me again?

                         TRACY
          Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And
          a hot tub.

                         SARA
          That's your apology?
          Tracy jumps up and walks over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         TRACY
          What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry
          -- I totally screwed up.
          Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She
          watches Tracy and Sara.
          Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.

                         SARA
          I forgive you.
          Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
          she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.
          Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca
          takes it.

                         SARA
          But you're on your own at Psi U.
          Because...

                         (DRAMA BUILDING)
          Someone has a date.
          Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes
          the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress.

                         SARA
          You look... nice.

                         REBECCA

                         (EXCITED)
          Thanks. Richard Prince is having a
          showing. I bought two tickets.

                         (BEAT)
          Since he's your favorite artist...

                         SARA
          Actually, I... sort of have a date?

                         REBECCA

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Oh. Okay.
          Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy
          silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat.

                         SARA
          You know, I could reschedule.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         REBECCA
          (being a martyr)
          You don't have to.

                         SARA
          I want to. On one condition...
          Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on
          Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.
          Rebecca smiles.

                         REBECCA
          I love it, who's the designer?

                         SARA
          What are you, a label whore?! Who
          cares ...I got it at a flea market
          and it looks great with the dress.
          Rebecca nods in agreement.

                         SARA
          It just needs one last touch...
          She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her
          dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.

                         SARA
          I'm gonna jump in the shower, then
          we'll head out.
          She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.
          Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the
          full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the
          mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.
          She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the
          skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...
          SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood
          trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with
          her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.

          INT. ART GALLERY - DUSK

          Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings
          are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of
          women, peering at the viewer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every
          guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But
          Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.
          ON CELL PHONE: "sorry. next time : ("
          Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and
          starts studying the paintings.

          EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT

          It's night and there's not a soul in sight.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to
          the...

          INT. DORM ROOM - LATER

          Sara sleeps peacefully. Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.
          Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...
          Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.
          Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?
          Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She
          walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She
          stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara
          would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.

          INT. DORM ROOM - BARELY SUNRISE

          Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She
          reaches around her, slapping her end table.

                         TRACY
          Water. I need water.
          She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She
          groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...
          And lets out a sharp little scream.

          INT. DORM - HALLWAY - SAME

          Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against
          the wall. Staring at Tracy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         TRACY
          Rebecca? What are you doing?
          Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to
          comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.
          Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose
          demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.
          She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca
          turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and
          smiles. She disappears into her room.
          Tracy stands there, spooked.

          EXT. QUADS - DAY

          AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks
          ten yards behind them, waiting until...
          Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down
          different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up.

                         SARA
          Hey. How was the party? Are you
          still the beer bong queen?
          But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.

                         TRACY
          Listen... something is up with your
          roommate.

                         SARA
          What do you mean?

                         TRACY
          She was outside my room this
          morning.

                         SARA
          Doing what?

                         TRACY
          Waiting for me. I opened my door...
          and there she was. Just sitting
          there, staring. Like some psycho.

                         SARA
          Are you sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         TRACY
          You don't believe me?

                         SARA
          No, it's just... why would she do
          that?

                         TRACY
          Why don't you ask her? I've gotta
          go...I'll see ya later.
          Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy
          turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes
          catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.
          Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.
          Tracy leaves in a hurry.

          INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO

          Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at
          the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each
          sporting a different fashion style.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Contrary to popular opinion, beauty
          is not in the eye of the beholder.
          It's in the hands of the designer.
          Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes
          with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Who can tell me the difference
          between fashion and style?
          FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the
          message.
          Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and
          calls on her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Miss Matthews?
          Without missing a beat, Sara replies.

                         SARA
          Fashion's something you can buy,
          but style you either have or you
          don't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Exactly. All the money in the
          world can't buy you style.

                         SARA
          But it can buy you a good stylist.
          The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she
          walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee.

                         SARA
          Hey. How'd you know when my class
          got out?
          Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.

                         REBECCA
          I'm your roommate.
          Sara smiles and grabs a cup.

                         SARA
          Thanks.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. QUADS - LATER

          They walk through the quads. Other students are around, some
          strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class.

                         SARA
          Listen... Tracy told me something
          kinda weird. She says you... scared
          her this morning.
          Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.

                         REBECCA
          What?

                         SARA
          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         REBECCA
          It's more like she scared me. She
          was racing to the bathroom like she
          was gonna hurl. She almost knocked
          me over.
          A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.

                         SARA
          The girl does like to party.
          Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.
          Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from
          Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"

                         SARA
          I gotta go meet Irene.
          (raises her cup)
          Thanks for the coffee.
          Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

          Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.

          INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY

          Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up
          artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars
          worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.
          She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being
          worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.

                         IRENE
          (mouth full of pins)
          Finally.
          She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.

          INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - LATER

          Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in
          awe. An OLDER DESIGNER walks by... checks on Irene's work...
          nods his approval... and leaves.

                         SARA
          I so want to be you when I grow up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         IRENE
          Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up.

                         MAKE-UP GIRL

                         (TO SARA)
          She's going to be a star.
          Irene rolls her eyes.

                         IRENE
          You know, your dad left me four
          messages last week. Making sure I'm
          looking out for his baby.

                         SARA
          Oh god. I hope you told him I'm
          closing down the library every
          night.

                         IRENE
          I told him I haven't seen you. And
          that for all I know you're a crack
          ho by now.
          Even the model laughs.

                         SARA
          Perfect.

          INT. LIBRARY - DUSK

          Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen
          sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil.
          Ignoring the open textbook in front of him.
          She sits down across from him. They both smile.

                         STEPHEN
          I haven't seen you around too much
          since you blew me off for dinner.

                         SARA
          Sorry again. Actually, how about
          dinner tonight?

                         STEPHEN
          Hellllo. I'm studying.
          She takes his book. He's on page two.

                         SARA
          Page two? Busted!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, but it's really dense.
          Off Sara's smile.

                         STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Okay. Let's go.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way.

                         KIM
          How's it goin?

                         TRACY
          Hey.
          Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she
          walks, steps into the bathroom.

          INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

          She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.
          She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the
          curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...
          The lights go out.

                         TRACY
          You have to be kidding me. Hey!
          The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
          window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.
          Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...
          The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her
          towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.
          The lights go off again.

                         TRACY
          Goddammit !
          She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one
          of the other showers turns on. What the hell?

                         TRACY
          Hey, how about turning on the
          light?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          No response. Yet another shower turns on.

                         TRACY
          Who's out there?
          Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
          the wall again. She turns on the lights.
          The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.
          Tracy stares at them. A beat.

                         TRACY
          I know it's you.
          She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
          curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns
          it off. She stares at the other curtain.

                         TRACY
          Sara thinks you're weird. She told
          me.
          She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
          that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.
          She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed
          again. The sound of running water behind it.
          She walks over.

                         TRACY
          Not funny, Rebecca.
          (under her breath)
          Bitch.
          She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the
          curtain open to see...
          Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
          no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the
          water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.

                         TRACY
          Freak.
          Just as the warm water starts to relax her...
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.
          The curtain comes right off the rings.
          Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor
          hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against
          the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.
          Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.

                         REBECCA
          So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me
          tell you what I think. I think
          you're a little whore, and a bad
          influence on her. And I think that
          if you tell anyone about... what
          I'm about to do... you'll regret
          it.
          Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other
          hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.
          Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she
          needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.
          A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.
          Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,
          Rebecca looks down at...
          The bloody ring in her hand.

                         REBECCA
          Nice belly ring.
          She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her
          shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm going to flunk my test
          tomorrow, thanks to you.

                         SARA
          Then let's make sure it was worth
          it.
          She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.

                         STEPHEN
          Duh, joke's on you. I was going to
          flunk anyway.
          She smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her
          fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the
          bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She
          smiles -- must be Sara.
          She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
          the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.
          She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her
          cell phone and dials.

          INT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye.

                         STEPHEN
          Thanks for helping me... not study.

                         SARA
          Anytime.
          He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.
          Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.

                         REBECCA
          Where were you?

                         SARA
          Oh, hi.

                         REBECCA
          I kept calling and calling.

                         SARA
          Oh. I turned my cell off at the
          library and forgot to turn it back
          on.

                         (FRAZZLED)
          Rebecca... this is Stephen.
          He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.

                         REBECCA
          I'm going to bed now. I'm glad
          you're okay.
          She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara
          bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         STEPHEN
          You got a curfew?

                         SARA
          Well, she's right...I shoulda
          called.
          He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the
          elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient
          doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more
          kiss. The doors close.
          Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door
          and sighs.

          EXT. QUADS - MORNING

          Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.
          Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As
          they reach the fork in the path...

                         SARA
          I guess I'll see you later.

                         REBECCA
          Sara...

                         (SHE TURNS)
          Last night. I was just worried
          about you.

                         SARA
          You don't need to worry about me.
          I can take care of myself. Okay?
          Rebecca slowly nods.

                         REBECCA
          Sara. We're good, right?
          A beat. Sara nods and smiles.

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them.
          Stephen is reading Rolling Stone.
          Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a
          message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks
          to add her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          INT. LIBRARY

          Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library.
          Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through
          the glass.

          INT. LIBRARY

          Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only
          one friend: Sara. She's posted the picture of her and Sara in
          front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a
          picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria."
          Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard
          Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote
          Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.

                         SARA
          I'm already her best friend?

                         STEPHEN
          That's a little sad.

                         SARA
          Stop.
          But the look on her face says she agrees.

                         STEPHEN
          Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you
          know what I mean.
          She looks at him quizzically.

                         SARA
          I don't.
          He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          You... are...a...moron.
          He grins.

          INT. LIBRARY - PERIODICAL RACKS

          Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to
          read. Is she jealous... or entranced? Sara gets up and
          leaves. Stephen goes to the stacks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          INT. LIBRARY - STACKS - LATER

          Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.
          The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.
          Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.
          He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his
          shoulder, we see...
          REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the
          next aisle over.
          Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking
          at the numbers of the books.
          Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.
          Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on
          Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.
          So does Rebecca. She's completely still.
          Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers
          Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's
          not the right one. He keeps walking.
          He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of
          hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the
          markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which
          direction to go.
          Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to
          get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts
          down the next aisle.
          Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.

                         REBECCA
          Stephen.
          Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
          keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.

                         STEPHEN
          Shit, wrong aisle.
          He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
          EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          EXT. PARK - NIGHT

          Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path. Holding hands. He
          checks his watch.

                         STEPHEN
          Should we head back home?
          They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
          jungle gym, etc.

                         SARA
          The question is "whose home?"

                         STEPHEN
          Hmmm...

                         SARA
          I'll make you a bet. I go back to
          your place or you take me home to
          my twin bed and roommate.

                         STEPHEN
          What's the bet?
          She eyes the jungle gym.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARK - PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym. This
          has been going on for a few minutes. Both straining.
          Stephen's worse off.

                         STEPHEN
          This is kind of a stupid bet.

                         SARA
          Why'd you agree?

                         STEPHEN
          Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid
          guy.

                         SARA
          Making me laugh isn't going to help
          you.
          They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much
          more in control as Stephen is straining.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He
          catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him
          fall. She then lets go, victorious.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          I was a gymnast until I hit a
          growth spurt my freshman year.
          Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this
          close". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful
          shove.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          So I win.
          He gives her a playful shove back.

                         STEPHEN
          So.
          She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.

                         SARA
          So...let's go back to your place.
          She gives him a seductive grin.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00
          a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's
          pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.
          She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair
          back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial
          button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.
          She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:
          A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk
          drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:

          "JASON".
          A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.

           JASON (O.S.)
          Sara?

                          REBECCA
          Mmmm?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

           JASON (O.S.)
           Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can
           we talk... about us?
           Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down
           on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now
          she lies down.

                          REBECCA

                          (WHISPERS)
          I miss you.
          She moves her hand across her stomach.

           JASON (O.S.)

                         (RELIEVED)
          You do?

                         REBECCA
          I want you, Jason.

           JASON (O.S.)
           I.. . want you, too. But...
          Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties.

                          REBECCA
           I miss touching you. Do you miss
           touching me?

           JASON (O.S.)
           Like you wouldn't believe.

                          REBECCA
           Prove it.

          INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing
          madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks
          it open and peeks inside.
          His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for
          empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes.

                         STEPHEN
          Just give me thirty seconds.

                         SARA
          You're kidding.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him.
          Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME

          Stephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans,
          clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag.

                         STEPHEN
          Almost there.

          SARA (O.S.)
          (through the door)
          I'm going to start taking my
          clothes off out here.

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, right.
          He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster.

          SARA (O.S.)
          Oops! There goes my shirt...
          She's got his attention now. He speeds up.

                         STEPHEN
          You know I don't believe you.

                         (WORRIED)
          Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to
          be my strip tease.

          SARA (O.S.)
          There go the jeans.
          He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm just going to put your clothes
          back on and make you strip again.

          SARA (O.S.)
          Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom?
          Stephen stops and stares at the door.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

          Sara stands there, fully dressed. She looks down the empty
          hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         SARA
          Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let
          me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra?
          Okay, okay. Just calm down.
          The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her,
          grinning.

                         STEPHEN
          I knew you didn't have the guts.
          She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He
          tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams
          shut behind them.

          INT. DORM ROOM - SAME

          Rebecca is breathing harder and faster now. Still holding the
          phone, from which we hear Jason's moans.

                         REBECCA
          Say my name, Jason. Until I tell
          you to stop.
          She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow
          beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers.

          JASON (O.S.)
          Sara... Sara... Sara...
          Rebecca writhes, eyes closed.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM

          Sara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked. He lies on top
          of her. Looking into her eyes. Sweet and intimate.

                         STEPHEN
          Sara...

          INT. DORM ROOM - SAME

          Rebecca writhes and moans.

          JASON (O.S.)
          Sara... Sara...
          They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish.
          A long beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          JASON (O.S.)
          (catching his breath)
          Jesus, Sara. That was incredible.
          Rebecca smiles.

          JASON (O.S.)
          I miss you so much.
          Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her
          eyes.

                         REBECCA
          Don't ever call me again.
          She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.

          EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - MORNING

          Carnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara, hair mussed up but eyes shining. Sara opens her door
          and steps in. She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down
          her throat. But Rebecca smiles.

                         REBECCA
          Well, good morning.

                         SARA
          Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot
          my phone.

                         REBECCA
          No problem.
          Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly
          checks. No calls.
          Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.

                         REBECCA
          Come on...don't I get any details??

                         SARA

                         (SMILING)
          A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell.
          They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         SARA
          You want to go get some breakfa--
          Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down
          the hallway.

                         SARA
          Oh no.
          Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed.

          INT. HALLWAY

          Sara turns the corner to see...
          The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms.
          Sara apprehensively walks up to him.

          R.A.
          Is this your cat, Sara?

                         SARA
          Maybe...

          R.A.
          She's cute...
          She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She
          turns to walk back to the room.

          R.A.
          And if you keep her, I lose my job.
          Do we understand each other?
          She stops. Turns. Looks at him.

                         SARA
          Yes.
          Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway.
          They exchange despondent looks. Screwed.

          INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Irene opens the door and Sara walks in.

                         IRENE
          What took you so long?

                         SARA
          I walked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         IRENE
          You didn't!

                         SARA
          It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a
          student.

                         IRENE
          Sara! You can't just walk around
          downtown L.A. at night. This is
          not Des Moines.

                         SARA
          Duh?

                         IRENE
          Seriously, listen to me. That's
          why I own a gun.
          Sara's shocked.

                         SARA
          What?!

                         IRENE
          Absolutely! Big cities are
          crawling with crazies.
          Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She
          answers.

                         SARA
          Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at
          Irene's. I meant to leave you a
          note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a
          good idea. Let me check, hold on.
          Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.

                         SARA

                         (TO IRENE)
          Do you like cats?

                         IRENE
          Yeah, why?

                         SARA
          We have to get rid of one.

                         IRENE
          Can't. Travel too much. Poor
          thing would starve to death.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         SARA
          You're right.
          (back into phone)
          No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't
          know... whenever I get there. Bye.

                         IRENE
          Who was that?

                         SARA
          My roommate. More than a little
          overprotective.

                         IRENE
          That's no fun.

                         SARA
          So, where is it?

                         IRENE
          What?

                         SARA
          You said you had a surprise for me?

                         IRENE
          Oh yeah. I went through my
          closet. There's nothing here I've
          worn in the past six months.
          Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.

                         SARA
          You're kidding, all of these?! Oh
          no.

                         IRENE
          What ...what?

                         SARA
          We have no closet space at the
          dorms. Rebecca's already using
          half of mine.

                         IRENE
          Oh my God, I just had the best
          idea.

                         SARA
          What?

                         IRENE
          Why don't you move in here with me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SARA
          Seriously?

                         IRENE
          Yeah, I'm never here. The place is
          huge. Ditch the roommate. And,
          the building allows pets.

                         SARA
          Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about
          it.

                         IRENE
          Great.

                         (BEAT)
          So, how's Jason? I really liked
          him.

                         SARA
          We broke up.

                         IRENE
          Yeah ...he sucked.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

          Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags
          spill out into the room, taking up floor space.
          Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at
          Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of
          Irene and some girlfriends.

                         REBECCA
          Hey. What're those?

                         SARA
          Irene gave them to me. She had a
          lot more but we don't have the
          room.

                         REBECCA
          Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles,
          huh?

                         SARA
          Well, maybe that's not a problem.

                         REBECCA
          Really?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         SARA
          Yeah. She actually suggested that
          I move in with her.

                         REBECCA
          What?

                         (BEAT)
          You want to move?

                         SARA
          No, of course not. I love living
          here... with you.
          Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a
          bright spin on things.

                         SARA
          Look, I'd still technically be
          living here. So you wouldn't have
          to get a new roommate. Her place is
          huge and it's not like you couldn't
          use the extra closet space. I'd
          just move some of my stuff over,
          and spend a few nights a week
          there. We'd both have a lot more
          space.

                         REBECCA
          I don't want more space. I want...
          She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.

                         SARA
          Nothing's set in stone. It's just
          something to think about. Plus we'd
          be able to keep Cuddles.
          As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares
          across the room at...
          Cuddles.

          EXT. QUADS - DAY

          As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking
          by herself.

                         SARA
          Tracy!
          Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she
          didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SARA
          Tracy... hey.

                         TRACY
          Oh, hey.
          Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle.
          Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's.

                         SARA
          I heard you changed dorms.

                         TRACY
          Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a
          better vibe.

                         SARA
          Well, we should get together. Like
          grab a bite or something. Right?

          REBECCA (O.S.)
          Sara!
          Sara turns and waves at Rebecca.

                         SARA
          Hi.
          Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara.

                         TRACY

                         (TO SARA)
          I'll call you.
          But she's already walking away.

                         SARA
          Tracy?!

                         REBECCA
          What was that about?

                         SARA
          I don't know. She just walked
          away.

                         REBECCA
          Well, she's always been a flake.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER

          Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her
          ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge,
          moving with a purpose.
          She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand
          and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders.

                         SARA

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez.
          Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink
          and walks away.

                         SARA
          Well, actually, I was thinking I'd
          do Thanksgiving here and see you
          guys for Christmas.
          She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what
          she's hearing.

                         SARA
          Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm
          really getting slammed...
          There isn't another customer in sight.

                         SARA
          I'll call you later, okay? Tell
          Dad I said hello. Bye.
          She hangs up the phone and sighs.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK

          Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she
          carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on
          Sara's bed. She scoops her up.

                         REBECCA
          Looks like it's just you and me
          tonight.

          INT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK

          Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry
          room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

          Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays
          with a sock on top of a nearby washer.
          Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes
          still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her
          duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.
          She pets her gently.
          She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.

                         REBECCA

                         (BABY TALK)
          See how nice and warm it is in
          there?
          Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door
          and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass.
          She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the
          dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and
          gets back up.
          Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.
          Cuddles stumbles. Flips over.
          The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,
          wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her
          last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.
          ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the
          glass at the kitten. She fingers the button.
          Before she pushes it --

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DORM ROOM - LATER

          Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying.
          She rushes over.

                         SARA
          Hey, what's wrong?
          Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.

                         REBECCA
          Cuddles got out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         SARA
          Oh no. In the dorm?

                         REBECCA
          Outside.

                         SARA
          What?!

                         REBECCA
          I was doing laundry... I took her
          with me... She jumped out of the
          bag and ran outside. I went after
          her, but...

                         (WHIMPERS)
          I'm so sorry.
          Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca...
          but the girl's so distraught, so fragile.

                         SARA
          Maybe she'll come back.

                         REBECCA

                         (EMPHATIC)
          She won't.

                         SARA
          I'm going to go find her.

                         REBECCA
          Do you want me to help?
          But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.

          INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING

          Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly.

                         SARA
          Maybe it's... just karma or
          something. We weren't allowed to
          keep her anyway.

                         REBECCA
          You're not mad at me?

                         SARA
          It was an accident.

                         (BEAT)
          It's just... stress after stress,
          you know?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         REBECCA
          Is something else wrong?
          A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.

                         SARA
          My parents really want me to come
          home for Thanksgiving.

                         REBECCA
          You don't want to go?

                         SARA
          It's not exactly the most festive
          holiday in the Matthews household.

                         (BEAT)
          Emily died two days before
          Thanksgiving.
          A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand.

                         SARA
          I know I should be there with them,
          but it's like there's a ghost at
          the table.

                         REBECCA
          You can come with me.

                         SARA

                         (THROWN)
          What?
          Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing.

                         REBECCA
          Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my
          house.

                         SARA
          Your folks wouldn't mind?

                         REBECCA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Please. Like they'd even notice.

                         SARA
          Okay, we'll see. Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Professor Roberts stands at the blackboard, wrapping up a
          lecture.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Your midterm designs are due
          Friday. Remember, class:
          Simplicity. Who founded our
          industry? Eve -- when she handed
          Adam that fig leaf.
          Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past
          Roberts...

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Sara. Could I see you in my office,
          please?

                         SARA

                         (SURPRISED)
          Sure. I've got a class right now.
          But I'll come right after it.

          INT. OFFICE - DAY

          Sara knocks on Professor Roberts' open door. She steps into
          his office. It's small and intimate, with books stacked along
          every wall. Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards.
          Roberts smiles at her from his chair. He walks to the door
          and closes it. He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers,
          and sits down. She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally
          brushing against his.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I don't think I need to tell you
          how impressed I've been with your
          work.

                         (BEAT)
          Every year I go to Fashion Week in
          Paris. It's dazzling. The photo
          shoots... the parties... that
          incredible runway. When the first
          model bursts through the curtain
          and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar
          goes up from that crowd that's
          like... nothing you've ever heard.

                         (BEAT)
          The college allows me to take one
          student. All expenses paid.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT-D)
          Full backstage access. Usually,
          it's a senior.

                         (BEAT)
          But it doesn't have to be.
          Sara's pulse is racing.

                         SARA
          I'm not sure I understand. Are you
          saying what I think you're saying?

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'm saying you have a shot. You'd
          have to earn it, Sara.

                         SARA
          Of course. I'll do... anything.
          Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
          quad... and now turns back to Sara.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'd like to see more danger in your
          work. Your designs are always
          crisp; they're always clear. But
          they're a little... safe.
          That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
          Roberts walks over to her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Don't be afraid to go to some of
          the...
          He delicately taps her temple.

          PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)
          darker places in here.

                         SARA
          Okay...
          He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks
          into her eyes.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          The best designers push the
          boundaries of what's... acceptable.
          They take chances. Do you like to
          take chances, Sara?

                         SARA
          Sometimes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          So do I.
          He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
          chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.

                         SARA
          I can't believe you just did that.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I took a chance, that's all. With a
          student that I trust.

                         SARA
          I better go.
          Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't
          blow the chance of a lifetime.
          She hurries out of the office.

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops
          down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.
          Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into
          space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans
          over, concerned.

                         REBECCA
          What's wrong?

                         SARA
          My design professor just kissed me.
          Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
          to Sara.

                         REBECCA
          Are you alright?
          Sara nods.

                         SARA
          Yeah, it just really creeped me
          out. And I think the asshole's
          married.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He
          tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.
          He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips
          it onto his finger.
          He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable
          clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop
          at his door.
          Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He
          walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the
          bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.
          He opens the door, revealing:
          Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black
          jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her
          shoulder.
          Roberts swallows his surprise.

                         REBECCA
          Professor Roberts?

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          That's right.

                         REBECCA
          I'm glad I caught you.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Actually, I was just...
          But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
          snapping on the worn hardwood floor.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her
          back inside. They face each other.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          You're not one of my students.

                         REBECCA
          Not yet. That's why I'm here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner
          is disarming. A beat.

                         REBECCA
          I'm failing Intro Pysch.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          And why is that?

                         REBECCA
          Because I'm bored. I thought it
          would be all about Freud, and deep
          dark secrets. But it's brain
          chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay
          awake in class.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not
          sure what I can do to help.

                         REBECCA
          Tomorrow's the last day to drop a
          course without penalty. Unless I
          can add another one in its place,
          I'll fall way behind in credits.
          Daddy won't take that very well. He
          might even pull the plug. Which
          means...

                         (BEAT)
          I'm pretty much at your mercy,
          Professor.
          Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
           so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Look, I've always made it a policy
          not to accept any students this
          late in the term.

                         REBECCA
          Do I look like just any student to
          you?
          She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
          feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.
          She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She
          sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it
          up.

                         REBECCA
          Your wife is very pretty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Ex-wife .
           The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,
          until he's behind Rebecca.
           In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
          his wedding ring. He palms it.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          A few things I'd need to know.

                         REBECCA
          Ask me anything.
          He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Do you have any design experience?

                         REBECCA
          None.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          What do you know about clothes?

                         REBECCA
          Only one thing.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          And what's that?

                         REBECCA
          I definitely look better out of
          them than in them.
          What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
           close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.
          Still steady.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I think we might be able to work
          something out.

                         REBECCA
          Great. Just tell me and I'll do
          anything.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Kiss me.

                         (BEAT)
          I'll take it from there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,
          and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had
          a taste -- he wants a lot more.
          Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.

                         REBECCA
          Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,
          stop!...
          Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.
          What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.
          This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her
          eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her
          again...
          She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the
          floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which
          rolls away across the floor.
          Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
          see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.

                         REBECCA
          Birthday gift. You should get one,
          they're great.
          She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
          seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior
          conversation, played back.

                         WALKMAN
          Great. Just tell me and I'll do
          anything.

                         (BEAT)
          Kiss me. I'll take it from there.

                         (BEAT)
          Owl You're hurting me! Professor,
          stop!...
          Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          You bitch tease!

                         REBECCA
          Oh, I'm not teasing.
          She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the
          floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         REBECCA
          Do you see enough danger in me now,
          Professor? Did I go to a dark
          enough place for you?
          He recognizes his own words to Sara.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          What? How did?... Who are you?
          He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
          slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells
          again.

                         REBECCA
          She trusted you.
          She walks toward the door.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Please don't do this. Twenty years.
          Everything I worked for. I'll pay
          for that tape.
           Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding
           ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.

                          REBECCA
           Yes you will.
           She walks out the door.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM

           Sara sits on Stephen's bed. She is looking out the window,
          holding a theory book in her hand.
          Stephen watches her from his side of the bed.

                         STEPHEN
          Anything wrong?
          Sara is taken out of her own world

                         SARA
          What?

                         STEPHEN
          Are you ok?

                         SARA
          Yeah, sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          She smiles. Stephen smiles back.
          Sara looks down in her book again.

          EXT. QUADS - DAY

          Sara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters.

          INT. HALLWAY

          She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students
          pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees...

          INT. CLASSROOM

          A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures
          for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused.

                         WOMAN
          Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll
          be taking over the class for the
          rest of the semester.
          Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the
          STUDENT next to her.

                         SARA

                         (WHISPERS)
          What happened?

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

          Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half-
          dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself
          in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her.

                         SARA
          Remember what I told you about
          Professor Roberts?

                         REBECCA
          Yeah?

                         SARA
          He's gone.

                         REBECCA
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         SARA
          Well, they're calling it a leave of
          absence. But what I heard... someone
          sent the dean an anonymous
          recording of him hitting on another
          student.

                         REBECCA
          Oh My God.

                         SARA
          I know.

                         REBECCA
          That's called Karma.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the
          counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her
          looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER

          Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up.

                         STEPHEN
          I've made a decision. You ready?

                         SARA
          Lemme hear it.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm gonna quit the band.

                         SARA
          No. Really? Why?

                         STEPHEN
          It's a waste of time-and we suck.

                         SARA
          Why would you say that?

                         STEPHEN
          Well, let me think about this. The
          only places we can get booked is at
          my own frat house and at my
          girlfriend's coffee shop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         SARA

                         (SMIRKS)
          You're right. You guys do suck.
          A beat.

                         SARA
          Hold it. Did you just say
          girlfriend?

                         STEPHEN
          You heard me.

                         SARA
          So you think it'll be fun to stay
          here during Thanksgiving?

                         STEPHEN
          Dinner at the frat, the football
          games. Don't forget the always
          awkward, homoerotic humor.

                         SARA
          Sounds like a blast.

                         STEPHEN
          Oh. For sure.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
          on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
          her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
          Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
          knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
          is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
          getting more and more numb to the blows.
          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
          grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
          retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
          out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
          the knife against her skin and...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal
          position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her
          things and runs over to her.

                         SARA
          Oh my God. What happened?
          She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her
          knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.

                         SARA
          Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe
          now. Talk to me.

                         REBECCA
          I was looking for Cuddles. A man...
          pulled me into an alley. He
          tried...
          Sara holds her. She can't finish.

                         SARA
          It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.

                         REBECCA
          I got away.

                         SARA
          You're alright now.
          Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She
          pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in
          her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the
          bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.

                         SARA
          It's not deep, thank God. But you
          should see a doctor.

                         REBECCA
          No.

                         SARA
          Rebecca, you need to. And then the
          police.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.

                         REBECCA
          I don't want to. I can't.
          Sara pulls out her cell phone.

                         SARA
          You're calling them, or I am.
          There's a psycho walking around
          this campus.

                         REBECCA

                         (CRYING AGAIN)
          Please. I didn't see him.
          She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts.

                         SARA
          Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let
          me help you.
          Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently
          as she works.

          EXT. STREET - DORM - DAY

          Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.
          Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go
          home for the holiday.

                         SARA
          Sorry about not staying. But,
          Rebecca...

                         STEPHEN
          I get it.

                         (KISSES HER)
          I'm going to make out with my
          pillow and pretend it's you.

                         SARA
          Just say you'll miss me.

                         STEPHEN
          I'll miss you.
          Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives
          Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

          INT. CAR - DRIVING: LATER

          Sara looks down at her phone.

                         SARA
          I haven't heard from Jason in
          weeks. It's weird how he just
          stopped calling.

                         REBECCA
          It's what you wanted, right?
          Sara nods, reassuring herself.

                         SARA
          Yeah. Yeah it is.
          Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.

          EXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK

          Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion
          that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and
          Famous.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK

          Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the
          mansion. Sara is in shock.

                         SARA
          This is your home?

                         REBECCA
          It's my parents house. It was
          never a home.

          INT. FOYER - DUSK

          Rebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as
          Sara closes the door.
          Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father
          gives her an awkward hug.

                         DAD

                         (SURPRISED)
          We didn't think you would make it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          Her mother sees the bruises on her face.

                         MOM

                         (ALARMED)
          What happened?

                         REBECCA
          Nothing.

                         DAD
          Nothing? This isn't nothing.

                         REBECCA

                         (SNAPS)
          Leave it alone.
          Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives
          her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely
          raising her arms.

                         DAD
          Hello. And you are?

                         SARA
          I'm Sara.
          She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't
          tell them?

                         REBECCA
          Sara's my roommate.

                         DAD

                         (PLEASED)
          I'm Jeff.
          Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara.

                         MOM
          It's so great to meet you, Sara.
          I'm Alison.
          Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.

                         REBECCA
          Come on, let me show you my room.

          INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DUSK

          Rebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         SARA
          You didn't tell them we were
          coming?

                         REBECCA
          They didn't need to know.
          Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
          typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just
          drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage
          girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one
          teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.

                         SARA
          These are interesting.

                         REBECCA
          Yeah, some of my high school work.
          I haven't gotten around to takin
          them down.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large
          dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but
          not pretentious.
          Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
          her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.

                         SARA
          Rebecca's a pretty great artist.

                         JEFF
          Yeah, we think Rebecca is so
          talented.
          Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.

                         SARA
          She's an awesome roommate, too.

                         JEFF
          (looks at his daughter,

                         POINTEDLY)
          That's nice to hear and I'm sure
          she likes you because she never
          brings anyone home before.
          Rebecca stares at her father.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         REBECCA
          Dad!

                         JEFF
          What? As a parent you worry. You
          protect your daughter all her life
          and then she goes off to college
          and she's on her own. I'm just
          relieved she got a good roommate.
          Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these
          people?

                         ALISON
          Sara, I'll make up a room for you --

                         REBECCA
          She'll stay in my room.
          Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.

          INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a
          makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.

                         REBECCA
          We can share the bed if you want.
          Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the
          walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the
          drawings of Rebecca looking at her.

                         SARA
          Sure.
          Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.
          Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.

                         REBECCA
          Thanks for coming.

                         SARA
          Next Thanksgiving, you can run
          interference with my family.

                         REBECCA
          Done.
          Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A
          beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever
          so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt
          something. She closes them again.

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's
          lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.

                         KITCHEN
          Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
          Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.
          Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.

                         JEFF
          Becs. You scared me.
          Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
          look. We know how much she hates nicknames.

          INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from
          downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.

          INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

          Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and
          to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the
          moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.

                         JEFF
          How're you doing?

                         REBECCA
          Fine. My grades are good.

                         JEFF
          That's not what I meant.
          She looks down at the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         REBECCA
          I'm making friends.
          Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.

                         JEFF
          Rebecca, look at me for a second.
          Now she looks at him.

                         JEFF
          Your mother and I are very fond of
          you.

                         REBECCA
          I know.
          He doesn't know what else to say.
          Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
          Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the
          beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile
          happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.

                         JEFF
          I just wanted to make sure. Good
          night, I'm heading back to bed.
          He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.

          INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

          Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.

                         ALISON
          Hi Sara.

                         SARA
          Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some
          of her high school hangouts.

                         ALISON
          Wonderful.
          Alison peers up the stairs.

                         ALISON
          Rebecca seems to be doing well.

                         SARA
          Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         ALISON
          Is she taking her medication?

                         SARA
          Medication?
          Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
          Did she hear them? She walks down.

                         ALISON
          Hey sweetheart.
          She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.

                         REBECCA

                         (TO SARA)
          Ready?
          Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
          Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.

                         ALISON
          Have a great time, you two.

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

          It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.
          Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts
          discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.

                         REBECCA
          Is everything okay?

                         SARA
          Yeah. It's just...
          She wants to ask her about that medication.

                         SARA
          Nice to see where you come from.

                         REBECCA

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Come on.

          INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY

          Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE
          CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.
          She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         SARA
          Thanks.
          The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.
          What's she doing with Rebecca?
          The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep
          glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them
          a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.

                         REBECCA

                         (TO SARA)
          I used to come here like every day
          after school.
          The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
          One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.
          Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's
          Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.
          The chatting girls all fall silent.

                         SARA
          You know them?

                         REBECCA
          They went to my high school.

                         SARA
          Friends?
          Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye
          contact with the Brunette.
          The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.
          Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.
          As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.
          The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances
          at Rebecca as they order their drinks.
          Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
          Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.
          Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.

                         REBECCA
          Let's leave.
          Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
          things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.
          The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         REBECCA
          Hello, Maria.

                         MARIA

                         (WARY)
          Hello.
          The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,
          sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their
          friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all
          this from a few feet away.
          Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.

                         REBECCA
          Oh, I wanted to introduce you to
          Sara. My roommate.
          Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
          as if she feels sorry for her.

                         MARIA
          Hi.
          Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
          awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.

                         SARA
          Well, we better go.
          Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
          they open the door...

                         MARIA
          Rebecca.
          Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.

                         MARIA
          We were never friends.
          Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
          building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say
          this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.

                         SARA
          Come on, let's go.

          INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING

          Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in
          thought.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         SARA
          I guess college is a fresh start
          for both of us.
          Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement
          on her face.
          Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
          looks at the text message she just received from Irene:
          "back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."

                         SARA
          Irene's back in town.
          Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

          Sara's running through the quad.

          EXT./INT. DORM - DAY

          Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
          the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
          elevator, heading straight to the stairs.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          She bursts out the door and into the hallway.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing
          her back-pack.

                         REBECCA
          (not looking up)
          Good run?

                         SARA
          (between deep breaths)
          Great. You wanna go get dinner?

                         REBECCA
          I'm going to the art studio.

                         SARA
          Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         REBECCA
          Don't wait up, Sara...

                         (GRINS)
          I feel inspired.
          She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her
          sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at
          the closed door.
          As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.

                         REBECCA
          Forgot my pad.
          She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's
          dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY

          Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the
          empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she
          really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:
          Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through
          them: Empty.
          She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
          beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:
          Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."
          Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...

          A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.
          She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
          Your door was open.

                         SARA
          Oh my God.

                         STEPHEN
          Sorry.
          Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
          tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         STEPHEN
          What are those?
          A beat. Should she bring him into this?

                         SARA
          That's what I intend to find out.

          INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

          Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her
          drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a
          pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She
          looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train
          comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
          Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her
          drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks
          up and we see what she's been staring at:
          Irene.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.
          Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry.

                         SARA

                         (READING)
          APD -- anti-social personality
          disorder. Also known as sociopathy.
          They look at each other.

                         STEPHEN
          Jesus. I thought she was just
          weird.

                         SARA
          It says lithium can control the
          condition.
          (nodding at the bottles)
          Maybe these are refills. Maybe
          she's been taking it all along.

                         STEPHEN
          Certainly doesn't seem like she's
          been taking them.
          He's right and she knows it. A beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         SARA
          I think it's time I moved in with
          Irene.

          INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

          A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and
          three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic
          martinis and watching the dance floor.
          And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by
          herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around
          her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.
          Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds
          her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices
          Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE

          THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS

          IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

          INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door
          opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.
          Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.
          She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.
          Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her
          in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and
          smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find
          Rebecca's in the mirror.

                         IRENE
          I'm sorry to stare, but you are so
          beautiful.

                         REBECCA SMILES

                         REBECCA
          Thanks. So are you. Great lips.
          What kind is it?

                         IRENE
          It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl
          never knows how late she's gonna
          party.
          Rebecca smiles. A beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         REBECCA
          Can I try it?
          Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
          pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.

                         REBECCA
          You're right... cinnamon.
          Irene smiles.
          This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.

                         REBECCA
          Why don't we get out of here. I'd
          invite you to my place, but I have
          a roommate.

                         IRENE
          As luck would have it, I'm only two
          blocks away and...no roommate.

                         REBECCA
          What are we waiting for?

          INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to
          the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes
          the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to
          the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent
          the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..

                         IRENE
          Shit.
          She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She
          stumbles out into the...

          HALLWAY.
          She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen.
          We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and
          switches on the light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her
          glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the
          glass again.
          Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She
          switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to
          go back to her room ...WHAM!!
          Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.

          CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR

          EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

          Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old
          art deco apartment building.

          INT. LOBBY - MORNING

          Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No
          answer.

          EXT. STREET - MORNING

          She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running
          again.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - MORNING

          Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the
          door.

          INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING

          She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up
          when she sees Sara.

                         REBECCA
          Hey!

                         SARA
          Hey yourself. Where were you all
          night?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         REBECCA
          Oh, I got inspired. I just lost
          track of time.
          Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,
          grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her
          tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.
          A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
          "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.

                         SARA

                         REBECCA --

                         REBECCA
          I want a tattoo.

                         (SARA'S SHOCKED)
          Will you come with me?

                         SARA
          Uhhh...

                         REBECCA
          Please. It would mean a lot to me.
          I won't be able to do it without
          you.
          Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.

                         SARA
          Um... sure. Okay.

          INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY

          The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples.

                         SARA
          You can't rush this, Rebecca. We
          can always come back.

                         REBECCA
          I know what I want.

                         SARA
          Okay. I'm out here if you need me.
          Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
          She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,
          Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. TATTOO PARLOR - LATER

          Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th
          time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene:
          "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
          Sara's relieved.

                         STAIRS
          Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
          puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.

                         SARA
          Let's see it.
          Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just
          under her collarbone:

                         "EMILY"
          Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.

                         REBECCA

                         (SWEETLY)
          Think of me as your sister.
          Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara.

                         REBECCA
          If you want... you can call me
          Emily.
          Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves
          toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.

                         REBECCA
          What's the matter?
          Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
          of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.
          Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.
          Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches
          her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

          The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps
          out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door.

                         STEPHEN
          This is all you're taking?

                         SARA
          I'll get the rest of my things when
          Irene comes back to town.
          He takes the box. Then notices --

                         STEPHEN
          Where's your necklace?
          She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.

                         SARA
          I can't find it. It's okay.

                         STEPHEN
          Sara...

                         SARA
          I'm not going back up there.
          He hands her the box. Time to man up.

                         STEPHEN
          Wait here. I'll go look for it.
          She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back
          at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.
          Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.
          Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up,
          taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters.
          She puts the camera down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STEPHEN
          Have you seen Sara's necklace?
          Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
          dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca
          watches him.

                         REBECCA
          What did I do?
          He stops searching. Looks at her.

                         STEPHEN
          She just needs to move on.

                         REBECCA
          With you?
          He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
          Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.

                         STEPHEN
          If you do find it, can you let me
          know?
          Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his
          picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps
          out of it and walks out the door.
          She watches him go.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - DAY

          Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class
          mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders.

                         STEPHEN
          You should call someone. The dean's
          office. Or at least your R.A.
          She keeps cleaning.

                         SARA
          And tell them what? What has she
          really done to me? No one can do
          anything.

                         (BEAT)
          It's the weirdest thing, Stephen.
          The girl's own parents are afraid
          of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STEPHEN
          Well, she sure scared the shit out
          of me.
          Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of
          his t-shirts.

                         SARA
          Are these dirty or clean?
          Stephen sniffs the shirts.

                         STEPHEN
          Somewhere in between.
          She throws the t-shirts at him.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY

          Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual. Bumping into
          people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca
          before Rebecca spots her.
          She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks
          back at the quads.

          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Sara locks the front door and heads back home.
          She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...
          Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of
          the quad.
          No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the
          side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca
          keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the
          pavement, listening to her Walkman.
          Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,
          preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.
          Five...
          But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little
          further and turns around.
          Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks
          around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the
          living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.
          Sara smiles. She's safe.

          INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT

          Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the
          open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her
          Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the
          floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM

          Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from
          outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,
          reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from
          the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY

          It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.

                         SARA
          Seriously. Is it a game to be as
          loud as you possibly can?
          She waves her arms like a crazy person.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          How many walls can you possibly
          bump into!?
          They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to
          shout down the hall. Stephen eyes her warily. Her cellphone
          rings. She pulls it out of the purse: Jason.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as
          she gets up from the table.

                         SARA
          Hey, I'm going to hit the library.

                         STEPHEN

                         (GETTING UP)
          I can walk you there.

                         SARA
          No, it's okay.

                         STEPHEN
          Party starts at ten. Really cool
          band...

                         SARA
          I hear the drummer's really hot.

                         STEPHEN
          He may be, but I'm sleeping with
          his girlfriend...
          She kisses him.

          EXT. DORM - EVENING - NIGHT

          JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in
          front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.

                         JASON
          Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front
          of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm
          at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.
          Call me, okay?
          He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the
          door before it closes.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK

          Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom
          drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out
          her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.
          She puts the bottle back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the
          doors. He stops in front of Sara's room. Knocks lightly on
          the door. No answer. Knocks again.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,
          ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.
          Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,
          shredding it to pieces.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the
          door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right
          thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the
          elevator.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the
          door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note.

                         SARA -
          I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want
          to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...
          however long it takes. Please.
          Love,

                         JASON
          Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.

          INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT

          Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her
          fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water
          trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her
          reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long
          pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She
          gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,
          still looking at it in the mirror.
          She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
          Just above her shoulders.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs
          through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls
          out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in
          front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.
          Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.
          Which she caresses in her hand.

          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.
          Enjoying the silence.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

          A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just
          finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT
          GIRL smiles at him.

                         GIRL
          Help me find the keg?

                         STEPHEN
          Sure, I have to go look for my
          girlfriend anyway.
          She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch.
          Where's Sara?

          INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?
          The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the
          necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.
          She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she
          sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an
          open room.
          She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now
          plucks the master key card off the cart.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.
          The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for
          a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason
          barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.
          Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares
          down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the
          floor. She's in just bra and panties now.
          She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.

                         JASON

                         WHA--

                         REBECCA
          Shhhh.
          She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts
          kissing the back of his neck.

                         JASON
          Sara?

                         (BEAT)
          You got my voicemail.

                         REBECCA
          Mm-hmmm.
          Kissing his back now, moving lower.

                         JASON
          Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.
          She works her way back up to his ear.

                         REBECCA

                         (WHISPERING)
          Turn over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees...
          The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo.

                         REBECCA

                         (WHISPERING)
          Close your eyes.
          He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she
          needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.
          And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low
          light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against
          the skin of her back.
          Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.

                         JASON
          I love you, Sara.
          She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her
          hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.

                         REBECCA
          But she doesn't love you.
          Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those
          aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.
          Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in
          shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the
          knife deep into his gut. He gasps.

                         REBECCA
          You hurt her.
          She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He
          shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.

          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,
          but it's just the LIBRARIAN.

                         LIBRARIAN
          We're about to close.
          Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.
          Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new
          voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail
          button...
          But a text comes in from Irene:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          "Im back. Get your butt over here, I've got another surprise
          for you."

          INT. FRATHOUSE - NIGHT

          Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for
          Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.
          He heads up the stairs and into his room.

          INT. FRAT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new
          voicemail from Sara. He plays the message

          SARA (V.0.)
          Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping
          by Irene's, come on by. I want you
           guys to meet ...it's on 524 South
          Grand, Apt. 708. Love you.
          He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.

                         FRAT BOY
          All hands on deck -- the keg's
          still alive.

          EXT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk. She enters Irene's
          building.

          INT. IRENE'S ELEVATOR

          Sara rides up the elevator.

          INT. HALLWAY / DOORWAY

          Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but
          there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.
          She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.
          She knocks lightly. No answer.

                         SARA
          Irene?

          INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Sara steps into the foyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated
          living room. Dark and empty. Sara's starting to feel uneasy.

                         SARA
          Irene?
          There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She
          slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.
          CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.
          The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...
          Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a
          bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.
          Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.

                         SARA

                         (WHISPERING)
          Irene.
          Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts
          toward Irene...

          REBECCA (O.S.)
          Some role model she turned out to
          be. Couldn't even take care of
          herself.
          Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara
          drops her phone on the floor.

                         SARA
          Rebecca!
          Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.

                         REBECCA
          Sit down and shut up.
          Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.
          Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.

                         REBECCA
          Listen to me. All I ever wanted
          was to be your friend.
          A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.

                         SARA
          Rebecca, you are my friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         REBECCA
          No. Shut up. We're not friends.
          We're here because you betrayed me.

                         SARA
          Rebecca, I'm sorry--

                         REBECCA
          Stop it. Stop saying things you
          don't mean. I protected you.
          From that whore Tracy and that
          nasty little kitten... and That
          scumbag of a professor...

                         (BEAT)
          Even that loser ex-boyfriend of
          yours.

                         SARA
          What're you talking about? What'd
          you do to them? What'd you do to
          Jason?

                         REBECCA
          I got rid of them all. And how do
          you repay me? By leaving me.
          Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.
          She looks at Irene.
          Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in
          the eye. She puts everything she has into this.

                         SARA
          Rebecca, please forgive me.
          A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.

                         REBECCA
          Now we can start all over again.
          Let's make things the way they
          were, Sara. That first day. Just
          the two of us.
          Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.

                         SARA
          Rebecca...

                         REBECCA
          After all... you can only have one
          best friend.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SARA
          No! Don't!
          Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to
          buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her...

                         REBECCA
          Lay still bitch.

                         SARA
          Please. Don't do this...
          Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.
          She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.

                         REBECCA
          Stop! I mean it.
          Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.
          Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across
          the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.
          She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair
          from Sara's face.

                         REBECCA

                         (GENTLE)
          Shh... I'm so sorry.
          Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It
          skitters across the floor and out the door into the living
          room.
          Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs
          Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a
          chokehold.
          Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the
          chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.
          Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.
          She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara
          rises...
          Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of
          her. As Sara gasps for breath...
          Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.
          Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it.
          Rebecca turns around and goes for the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's
          head.
          IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But...
          Rebecca bangs the door.

          REBECCA (O.S.)
          Don't do this Sara!

          INT. BEDROOM

          Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against
          the steel handcuffs. Useless.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door.

                         REBECCA
          Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I
          just want to be your friend.

          INT. BEDROOM

          Sara and Irene are frantic.

                         IRENE
          My phone. My phone.
          She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.
          She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!

                         SARA
          Shit!

                         IRENE
          The window! There's a fire escape.
          You can reach it.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and
          furniture around. She finds it.
          Picks the gun off the floor.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an
          empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly
          impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

          Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot
          hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes
          to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.

          BLAM!

          INT. BEDROOM

          The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead
          and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers
          go flying. Irene screams.
          Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.

                         REBECCA
          I know you're scared, Sara. But I
          promise, everything is gonna be
          okay.
          She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
          Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in
          Irene's eyes.

                         REBECCA
          Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,
          not yours.
          She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...
          But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks
          her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...

          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

          Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling
          Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She
          grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.

                         SARA

                         (CRYING)
          Ohgodohgodohgod.
          The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,
          shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with
          Stephen.
          Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.
          He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying
          out of Rebecca's hand.
          Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist
          before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking
          her out cold.
          He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
          races for the window.

          SARA (O.S.)

                         (SCREAMING)
          Stephen! Help!

                         IRENE
          Hurry!!
          He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.

          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME

          Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her
          arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.
          Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets
          her cry. He smiles.

                         STEPHEN
          Okay I've got you. Everything is
          gonna be okay!
          He pulls her halfway in the window...
          But a shadow rises behind him.

                         IRENE

          STEPHEN!!!!
          A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.
          Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.
          Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...
          Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and
          lets go of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
          disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for
          leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
          time to see...
          Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps
          to the floor, revealing:
          Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
          Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
          window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.
          Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.

                         SARA
          Stephen.
          Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it
          out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes
          violently in her hand.
          Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
          the floor.

                         REBECCA
          You won't do it. We're fr--
          Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.
          Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in
          frustration. She drops the gun.
          Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara
          pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...
          Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her
          knuckles white, and...
          CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.
          She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...
          Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of
          Rebecca's purse everywhere.
          Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
          Sara.

                         REBECCA
          Friends help each other. They take
          care of each other.
          Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         SARA
          Rebecca. We were never friends.
          That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her
          eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from
          the floor, and slams her against the wall.
          She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns
          red. Redder...
          But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.
          Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The
          utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's
          shoulder blades.
          Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She
          won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...
          Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-
          consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out
          and grabs Sara's hand.
          Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from
          around Rebecca's neck.
          Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.

                         STEPHEN

                         (GROANING)
          Sara.
          She races over to him. He's barely alive.

                         SARA
          Stephen. Hold on.
          She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen
          and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.
          He looks into her eyes and smiles.
          She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in
          much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in
          front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.
          She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.
          She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about
          look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They
          don't say anything. Don't know what to say.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her
          previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.
          There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left
          behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.

          STEPHEN (O.S.)
          Welcome back.

                         SARA
          Hey. How are you feeling?
          Stephen enters the room.

                         STEPHEN
          Better now. You being here's gonna
          help.
          Sara smiles.

                         STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          How's moving in going?

                         SARA
          Just got here.

                         STEPHEN
          Well let me give you some time to
          get settled in.

                         SARA
          Actually, I need you right here,
          right now.
          Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.

                         STEPHEN
          Okay.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DORM HALLWAY

          Sara and Stephen push the twin bed into the hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

                         STEPHEN
          This isn't exactly what I had in
          mind.
          Sara grins.

                         SARA
          Now I can get settled in.

                         STEPHEN
          I'll be back to pick you up for
          dinner. You gonna be ready?

                         SARA
          Absolutely.
          Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her
          eyes before she goes back into her room.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where
          the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera
          slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf
          where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of
          Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming
          gallery exhibition.

          CUT TO BLACK.
THE RUINS

          
                                    Written by

                                   Scott Smith

          

          

          

          

          FADE IN ON:

          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

          The hotel is six stories high, a wall of glass and stucco.
          Beach chairs are arrayed around the pool's edge; sunbathers
          lie sprawled across them. A short boardwalk leads toward the
          Gulf of Mexico: the white sand, the blue water.
          Four young Americans are encamped near the pool's edge;
          they're all in their early twenties. AMY lies face down on a
          chaise, eyes shut, a cooler beside her. She's petite, with
          short blond hair, her skin pinkly sunburned.
          ERIC sits in the chair beside her, studying the Cliff Notes
          for The Canterbury Tales. He's leanly muscular, with dark
          curly hair. Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his
          chair: Antigone, A Separate Peace, Hea rt of Darkness, 1984.

          JEFF and STACY sit on the far side of the cooler; they're
          playing gin. Stacy, too, is petite, with short hair, though
          hers,. is dark. She's wearing a pale blue bikini, and has a
          beer bottle in her hand. She looks a little bored.
          Jeff is tall, scrawny. Like Eric, he has a pair of swim
          trunks on, and is deeply tanned. He's very focused, frowning
          down at his cards.

          STACY
          We should play War. It's more fun.
          Jeff takes a card from his hand, lays it down on the table.

          JEFF
          That's not even a game.

          STACY
          Sure it is. I'll teach you.
          She starts-to fold her hand,'but Jeff shakes his head.

          JEFF
          I know how to play. I mean it's
          just chance--there's no skill
          involved.

          Stacy frowns down at her hand, silenced. She picks a card
          from the deck, immediately discards it. Jeff snatches it up,
          lays down one of his own. Stacy stares at it in dismay.

          STACY
          But I keep losing.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          JEFF
          'Cause you're not concentrating.

          STACY
          I wouldn't have to concentrate if
          we played War.

          JEFF
          Exactly. So where's the fun?

          STACY
          I'd win sometimes. It's not fun if
          we both can't win.

          JEFF
          But it's not winning if it's just
          chance.

          STACY
          Of course it is. If we flipped a
          coin, and I called heads, and it--

          ERIC
          Fuck..;this.. shit.

          Eric throws the Canterbury Tales to the ground. Then he
          rises, steps to the cooler, pulls out a beer, carries it back
          to his chair. Stacy watches as he takes a long swallow.

          STACY
          Maybe you should just be honest,
          sweetie.

          Eric doesn't even glance at her. He sips his beer again.

          STACY (cont'd)
          You could say: look, I don't know
          anything about these either, so now
          we're gonna read them together and
          sort of teach each other as we go.
          (turning to Jeff)
          Wouldn't you have loved that? To
          have a teacher who--

          Amy speaks without opening her eyes, cutting Stacy off:

          AMY
          Why would they hire you if you
          haven't read the books?

          ERIC
          I said I had.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          JEFF
          So maybe you should..

          ERIC
          (appalled by the idea)
          The Canterbury Tales? You ever
          look at that shit?

          JEFF
          I've read it.

          ERIC
          Fuck off. It's not even English.
          Jeff watches Stacy take another card; she examines it, sets
          it on the discard pile. Then, RECITING:

          JEFF
          This world nys but a thurghfare ful
          of wo, and we been pilgrymes,
          passing to and fro. Deeth is an
          ende of every worldly soore.

          Eric and Stacy stare at Jeff in astonishment. Amy doesn't
          react. Jeff glances toward her.

          JEFF (cont'd)
          Sunscreen, Amy.

          AMY
          I'm fine. I've got a base.

          JEFF
          You're burning. I can see it.
          She finally opens her eyes, lifts her head, peers at her
          shoulders. She presses at the pink skin.

          ANY
          I'm just flushed. It's too hot.
          Stacy leans forward, picks a second card off the deck. Jeff
          is focused on Amy; he doesn't notice.

          JEFF
          You're hot because you're burning.

          AMY
          It's only been--
          Stacy interrupts, speaking in a slightly SINGSONG fashion:

          

          

          

          

          4.

          STACY
          So there was this king, who lived
          in a castle.
          Amy turns, gives her a pained look.

          AMY
          Please don't.

          ERIC
          But what he really wanted was a
          beach house.

          AMY
          Stop it. Both of you. Right now.
          They ignore her, ping-ponging quickly back and forth:

          STACY
          So he decided to move.

          ERIC
          But the Queen didn't want to.

          STACY
          So he left by himself.

          ERIC
          But he got lonely.
          Amy covers her ears with her hands, blocking out their
          voices, but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her
          earrings: one of them is missing.

          AMY
          Shit.

          STACY
          So he bought a dog.

          ERIC
          But it had fleas.

          AMY
          I lost my earring.

          STACY
          So he gave it a bath.

          ERIC
          But the dog caught. cold.
          Amy sits up, glancing about. Stacy and Eric keep going:

          

          

          

          

          5.

          STACY
          So he gave it some medicine.

          ERIC
          But it was the wrong kind.

          STACY
          So the dog died.
          Amy rises, steps toward the pool. Jeff lays down his cards,
          joins her beside the water. They both peer into it.

          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - BOARDWALK - DAY

          A young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach,
          carrying fins, a mask, a snorkel. He's in his early
          twenties: blond, crew-cut, very tall. His name is MATHIAS.
          As he nears the pool, he stops, staring.

          MATHIAS'S POV - THE POOL
          Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy; they're all
          peering into the water. Amy holds her remaining earring out
          to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks like.

          BACK TO SCENE - MATHIAS
          He stands there, hesitating. Then he starts forward.

          MATHIAS'S POV - THROUGH THE MASK - UNDERWATER - DAY
          We glide just above the pool's pale blue bottom. A silver
          earring comes into view. Mathias's hand reaches for it.

          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - DAY

          The two couples have spread out around the pool's edge,
          searching for the earring. Mathias surfaces in front of Amy.
          He holds out his hand, with the earring-in it; she stares,
          startled, then crouches to take it.

          AMY
          Thank you so much.
          .Mathias nods. He starts to turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff
          stops him:

          

          

          

          

          6.

          JEFF
          Wait. . .want a beer?
          He waves toward their chairs, the cooler beside them.

          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - LATER

          Mathias and the two couples sit together, with their beers.
          Amy's skin has turned deep red; Stacy is behind her, applying
          lotion to her shoulders. Eric is talking to Mathias:

          ERIC
          We went sailing yesterday. Out
          toward Cozumel? And there were
          these seven foot fish, these huge--

          JEFF
          Nurse sharks.

          ERIC
          (he nods)
          Like thirty of them. A whole, you
          know, flock.

          JEFF
          School.

          ERIC
          The water was, I don't know, ten
          feet deep? And they were lying on
          the bottom, just waiting for
          somebody to come swimming by--

          JEFF
          They're not dangerous.
          Eric turns, stares at Jeff.

          ERIC
          You said they're sharks.

          JEFF
          But they're not dangerous. They
          eat lobsters. Sea urchins. That
          sort of thing.
          Eric considers this, frowning. Then he takes a sip of beer.
          He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias.

          ERIC
          I wouldn't be snorkeling on my own.'
          That's all I'm saying.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          When Mathias speaks, it's with a SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT:

          MATHIAS
          I wasn't on my own. I was with my
          brother.
          Jeff glances around the pool.

          JEFF
          He's here?
          Mathias shakes his head.

          MATHIAS
          He met a girl. They went away.

          JEFF
          To?

          MATHIAS
          It's a complicated story.
          They watch him, waiting for more, but nothing comes. Finally:

          ERIC
          You should hang with us, then. If
          you're on your own.
          (he glances at the others)
          Right?
          Everyone nods, smiling. Eric reaches into the cooler, pulls
          out another beer, holds it toward Mathias.

          EXT. CANCUN BEACH - NIGHT

          There's a DJ, a dozen beer kegs. A few young men and women
          are dancing beside a bonfire, but most of the crowd is
          scattered in small groups across the sand, TALKING, drinking,
          the firelight flickering off their faces.
          Stacy, Amy, Eric, Jeff and Mathias are sitting together; they
          all have cups of beer. Stacy is between Eric's legs, leaning
          against his chest. Amy, Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged.
          Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk, and you can
          hear it in their voices. Amy drains her cup, stands up, very
          unsteadily. She holds out her hand to Jeff.

          AMY
          Dance.
          Eric smiles, as if the idea of Jeff dancing were absurd.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          ERIC
          Jeff doesn't dance, Amy--he has no
          rhythm. Of all his many gifts,
          rhythm is not one.

          AMY
          That's not true. He played the
          trombone in high school. He won a
          prize.
          Eric seems startled by this, amused.

          ERIC
          Seriously?
          Amy nods. She drains her beer, tosses the cup aside.

          AMY
          Jeff's won prizes for everything.
          His Mom has a whole room built just
          for them. Trophies and ribbons and
          plaques. He's a very accomplished
          young man.
          (she holds out her hand-to

          ERIC)
          You?

          ERIC
          (he shakes his head)
          I don't dance on sand.
          Stacy makes a SNORTING sound.

          STACY
          Or grass. Or cement. Or carpet.

          ERIC
          I dance on teak.

          AMY
          Teak?

          ERIC
          It's a type of wood. Very rare.
          Find me a teak floor and I'll be a
          dancing fool.
          Amy shifts toward Mathias, holds out her hand. He stares at
          it, then glances at Jeff. Before he can speak, Stacy pushes
          herself to her feet; she's almost as wobbly as Amy.

          STACY
          I'll dance.

          

          

          

          

          9.
          They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire. The boys
          watch them go. A beat, then Jeff glances at his watch.

          JEFF
          I'm gonna head back.
          Eric gives him a look of disappointment,

          ERIC
          You're kidding.
          Jeff seems STARTLED by this:

          JEFF
          What?

          ERIC
          How long is med school? Four
          years?
          Jeff nods.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          And then you got, whaddya call it,
          residency?
          Another nod. Eric turns toward Mathias.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          He's gonna be grinding away all
          that time. Sleepless. Fucking
          miserable. And know what? He's
          gonna look back on this night, us
          right here, and he's gonna say to
          himself, shit, I wish I'd--

          JEFF
          Gone to bed earlier.
          Eric stares at him; this wasn't the direction he was heading.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          If I'm gonna be so short on sleep,
          I should get as.much as I can now,
          don't you think?
          He stands up, brushes the sand from his shorts. Eric shrugs,
          lifts his cup toward him.

          ERIC
          All work and no play--

          

          

          

          

          10.

          JEFF
          Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and
          wise.
          With that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off
          toward the hotel. Eric and Mathias turn back toward the
          bonfire. They sit in silence, watching the girls dance.
          After a moment, Amy staggers away from the other dancers,
          toward a group of young men, drinking together in the
          shadows. She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet,
          starts to drag him back toward the bonfire.
          The young man is tall, with long blond hair. He LAUGHS,
          tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps
          pulling at him, and finally he surrenders. They begin to
          dance. Stacy is dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious.
          Mathias glances toward Eric. Eric shrugs.

          ERIC
          Amy drifts sometimes, when she
          drinks.

          MATHIAS
          Drifts?

          ERIC
          Like a boat--she bumps into other
          boats.
          They continue to watch. Amy and her partner's dancing is
          becoming steadily more intimate, the gap between their bodies
          narrowing, then disappearing altogether. Finally, Eric
          pushes himself to his feet.'
          ERIC (cont'd)
          Come on. Let's save everyone some
          grief.
          He starts. forward, followed by Mathias. They join Stacy and
          Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy's pas de deux. The blond-
          haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his friends.

          EXT. CANCUN BEACH - DAWN

          It's quiet, the sun just breaking the horizon; the beach is
          nearly empty. A handful of hotel employees are tidying up
          after the bonfire: carrying off the empty kegs, raking clean
          the rubbish-strewn sand. Gulls hover overhead, CAWING.

          

          

          

          

          11.
          Jeff appears, running along the beach, his T-shirt soaked
          with sweat. He stops as he nears us, stands for a moment
          just above the line of surf, catching his breath, watching
          the sun rise. Then he turns, starts toward the hotel.

          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - TERRACE - DAWN

          A breakfast buffet: trays of pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit.
          There are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas.
          Mathias is the only diner at this hour; he's dressed in jeans
          and a T-shirt. He studies a piece of paper as he eats.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          You're up early.
          Mathias lifts his head: Jeff is standing there in his sweaty
          shirt, smiling down at him.

          MATHIAS
          I have to catch a bus.

          JEFF
          To?
          Mathias slides the sheet of paper toward him. Jeff bends to
          look. There's a paragraph in German scrawled above a hand-
          drawn map, with four place names: Cancun, Valladolid,
          Tizimin, Coba. A large X has been drawn to the west of Coba.

          MATHIAS
          The girl my brother met was on her
          way to this place, to work.
          (he waves at the map)
          It's a dig--an archaeological dig.
          And he went with her. He left the
          map, saying I could come, too, if I
          got bored on my own.
          A beat; he watches Jeff examine the map. Then:
          MATHIAS (cont'd)
          Our flight leaves the day after
          tomorrow. I can wait and hope he
          returns in time.. Or I can go get
          him. It's a question of trusting
          him to do the right thing.

          JEFF
          And you don't?

          

          

          

          

          12.

          MATHIAS
          Henrich doesn't think things
          through. He runs at them. He's...
          (he searches, shakes his

          HEAD)
          There's a word in English, but I
          can't remember it.

          JEFF
          impetuous?

          MATHIAS
          (he nods)
          So I have to be--

          JEFF
          Responsible.

          MATHIAS
          All our lives, the same story.
          Jeff.slides the map back toward him.

          JEFF
          It's what? One of those pyramids?

          MATHIAS
          (he shakes his head)
          An old mining camp.

          JEFF
          De oro? 0 plata?
          Mathias just stares at him.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You don't speak Spanish?
          Mathias shakes his head.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          So how will you find this place?

          MATHIAS
           (he smiles, shrugs)
          Follow the m ap.
          Jeff frowns down at the map for a long beat. It seems as if
          he's going to question the feasibility of this, but. then he
          disengages instead, wiping at the sweat on his face.

          JEFF
          Well, good luck.

          

          

          

          

          13.
          Mathias nods his thanks, and Jeff turns, starts away from the
          table. WE MOVE with him, across the terrace, into the:

          INT. CANCUN HOTEL - RESTAURANT

          It's completely empty at this hour, and eerily silent.
          Chairs are stacked on the tables. As Jeff enters, a waiter
          moves past ham, carrying a pitcher of orange juice. Jeff
          stops, turns to watch through the window beside the door.

          JEFF'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW
          The waiter refills Mathias's glass. Mathias smiles, nods.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff hesitates, wavering. Then he pushes open the door
          again, steps outside. We watch--

          THROUGH THE WINDOW
          --as he approaches Mathias. There's the sound of someone
          RETCHING, COUGHING. This carries over into:

          INT. CANCUN HOTEL - JEFF AND AMY'S BATHROOM - DAY

          A rack with towels on it, a sink, a tub. Amy is crouched
          over the toilet, in underwear and a T-shirt, VOMITING. Her
          skin is bright red. Jeff is standing in the tub, freshly
          showered, drying himself, watching. her. His running clothes
          hang from a hook beside the door.

          JEFF
          You okay?
          Amy doesn't answer. She COUGHS, spits.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You don't have to come, you know.

          AMY
          I'm fine.

          JEFF
          You don't look fine.

          AMY
          Thank you. That's very helpful.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          She pushes herself to her feet, flushes the toilet, steps to
          the sink, squeezes some toothpaste onto a toothbrush.

          JEFF
          We'll be back by nightfall. You
          can just--
          Amy is raising the brush to her mouth, but she stops, gives
          Jeff a look in the mirror.

          AMY
          You don't want me to come?

          JEFF
          That's not what I'm saying.

          AMY
          So what're you saying?

          JEFF
          You're hungover, under slept,

          SUNBURNED--

          AMY
          I'm not sunburned.
          Jeff stares at her, the deep red of her face. Then he
          shrugs, steps out of the tub, the towel around his waist.

          JEFF
          .All right. My mistake.
          Amy bends over the sink, starts to brush her teeth.

          INT. CANCUN HOTEL - JEFF AND AMY'S BEDROOM - DAY

          A king-sized bed, a bureau, two night tables, a mini-fridge.
          Jeff emerges from-the bathroom, steps toward the bureau,
          starts to dress: boxers, jeans, T-shirt.
          A beat, then Amy shuffles out of the bathroom. She sits on
          the edge of the bed, starts to pull on a pair of shorts.

          JEFF
          Pants.
          Amy stops, the shorts around her ankles.

          AMY
          I'll get too sweaty.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          Jeff pulls a pair of khakis from the bureau, tosses them onto
          the bed beside her.

          JEFF
          There's gonna be mosquitoes.
          He picks up a knapsack, steps to the mini-fridge, opens its
          door. Amy stares down at the khakis for a beat, then drops
          back onto the bed. She lies there, looking up at the
          ceiling, her shorts still caught around her ankles.

          AMY
          We don't even know this guy.
          Jeff slides two bottles of iced tea into the knapsack.
          There's a plastic shopping bag beside the fridge, and he
          starts to dig through it.

          JEFF
          And?

          AMY
          I just don't see why we have to go
          with him.

          JEFF
          If you and I were traveling
          together, somewhere you didn't
          speak the language, and I'd
          vanished somehow, wouldn't you want
          someone to help find me?

          AMY
          Why would you vanish?
          Jeff turns, looks at her: this isn't the point.

          JEFF
          Aren't you getting bored?
          Honestly. The beach, the pool, the
          beach, the pool. This'll be fun.
          An adventure.
          Jeff pulls two protein bars from the bag, a box of raisins, a
          plastic bag full of grapes; he drops them into the knapsack.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You said you wanted to go;hiking,
          didn't you? See the ruins.
          Amy is silent, unmoving, clearly not swayed.

          

          

          

          

          16.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Stay here, then. Seriously.
          There's no--

          AMY
          Why do you keep saying that?

          JEFF

          BECAUSE--

          AMY
          It's like you'd rather I didn't--
          A KNOCKING at the door, and she falls silent. Jeff rises,
          zipping shut the knapsack. He steps to the door, opens it.
          Stacy and Eric are in the hall.

          ERIC
          Ready?
          The both answer at the same time:

          JEFF AMY
          Amy's having second thoughts. Jeff doesn't want me to go.
          Stacy and Eric are silent; neither wants to get involved in
          this. A beat, then Jeff SIGHS, glances at his watch.

          JEFF
          Now or never, Any. .We're gonna
          miss the bus.
          Amy gives a loud GROAN, sits up, reaches for her khakis.

          INT. TOUR BUS - DAY

          Only half the seats are occupied: tourists with their packs
          and cameras-and hats. Little TVs hang from the ceiling.
          We MOVE slowly down the aisle, passing Jeff and Amy first.
          Amy is sound asleep, a camera hanging from her neck, a Panama
          hat in her lap. Jeff is beside her, bent low over a tour
          book, comparing its much more detailed map with the one
          Mathias's brother left behind.
          Next come Eric and Stacy, hunched together in their seats,
          watching a Mexican soap opera on the little TV above them.
          Stacy mimics the actors' exaggerated gestures, GIGGLING.
          Eric has the Cliff Notes for Hamlet in his lap, unopened.
          Finally, there's Mathias. The seat beside him is empty.
          He's staring out the window, his expression perfectly blank.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          EXT. COBA - DAY

          The town is very small: a dirt road lined with one- and two-
          story buildings, some with thatched roofs. There's a gravel
          turnaround, with a bus idling in it. Its door CREAKS open.
          A dozen tourists emerge from the bus, blinking in the
          sunlight. Jeff, Amy, Stacy, Eric, and Mathias are among
          them. The boys have the knapsacks; the girls are wearing
          matching hats. Amy rubs at her face, stretching, waking up.-
          There's a souvenir stand at the town's entrance, with
          brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls. The
          tourists start toward it, leaving Jeff and the others beside.
          the idling bus. They peer about, getting their bearings.

          ERIC
          Now what?
          Mathias has his brother's note. He holds it out, pointing,
          and they gather around him to look.

          MATHIAS
          We take a cab. To here.
          WE SEE the map: there's a line drawn from Cancun to Coba,
          where another, shorter line moves westward. Mathias's finger
          moves along this shorter line, toward the X on the map.

          ERIC
          How far?

          MATHIAS
          Eighteen kilometers.

          STACY
          How many miles is that?
          They all glance at Jeff. He shrugs.

          JEFF
          Eleven. A little more.

          MATHIAS
          Then there'll be a path. Which we
          hike--four kilometers.
          The others look to Jeff again. He slings his pack.

          JEFF
          Two and a half miles.

          

          

          

          

          18.
          The tourists are vanishing into the town. The bus's door
          SQUEAKS shut.

          ANY
          I don't see any cabs.
          The bus eases into motion, CRUNCHING across the gravel,
          pulling out onto the road. Behind it, a yellow pickup truck
          is revealed. "TAXI" is hand-painted in black on its side.
          They start toward the truck. Its DRIVER is Mayan: short and
          heavy-set, with thick glasses. His eyes are shut; he's
          dozing behind the wheel. The truck's engine.is running, the
          windows shut tight against the heat.
          Jeff TAPS the window, and there's a burst of movement from
          the truck's rear, as a dog springs up, BARKING and GROWLING.
          They all leap back, the girls SHRIEKING.
          The dog is a mutt--small, but muscular. He's attached to a
          cinder block by a short chain, which he throws himself
          against, slobbering, snapping at the air.
          They all stare at the dog; the girls LAUGH nervously,
          clutching each other. The driver has roused himself; he
          leans forward, rolls down his window, stares out at them.

          JEFF
          Hola.
          The man gives him a somber nod; the dog keeps BARKING. Jeff
          takes the map from Mathias, then steps warily forward.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Habla ingles usted?
          The man half-nods, half-shrugs.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          How much to drive us to here?
          He offers the map to the driver, who reaches to take it. The
          man frowns at it. Then, in HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH:

          DRIVER
          Why you go this place?
          Jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission. in
          the back of the truck, the dog continues its frantic BARRING.

          JEFF
          There are these ruins. This old
          mining camp?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          19.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          (he points toward Mathias)
          And his brother---

          DRIVER
          Fifteen dollar, I take you ruins.

          JEFF
          To here?
          Jeff points at the map. The driver shakes his head.

          DRIVER
          This place no good.
          He holds the map back out toward Jeff. Jeff takes it, gives
          the man a puzzled look.

          JEFF
          No good?

          DRIVER
          No good you go. Fifteen dollar I
          take you good place. You like, I
          promise.
          Jeff glances toward the others, as if for help. They all
          just stand there, watching. The dog won't stop BARRING.
          DRIVER (cont'd)
          I take you pyramid. Huy grande.
          Everyone happy.
          He smiles at Jeff; his teeth are large and thick-looking,. and
          black along the gums. Jeff pulls out his wallet. He removes
          a ten and a five, then points at the map.

          JEFF
          How about we pay you fifteen
          dollars to go here?
          He holds the money out. The man doesn't even look at it.

          DRIVER
          I tell you no good. Still you go?
          His smile has disappeared; he seems angry suddenly, as if
          Jeff has somehow insulted him. Jeff hesitates, glancing
          toward the others again. Then, in a CONCILIATORY TONE:

          JEFF
          We're looking for his brother.
          (he points toward Mathias)
          Su hermano?

          

          

          

          

          20.
          The driver wrenches the door open, making Jeff and the others
          flinch. He climbs out, still with that angry expression on
          his face, then leans into the back of the truck, grabs the
          dog's chain, unhooks it from the cinder block.
          He lifts the dog from the truck by the chain. Even dangling
          by its neck, the mutt continues to SNARL and snap at Jeff and
          the others. They back away, and the man tosses the dog into
          the truck's cab, pushing the door shut. The dog throws its
          body against the window, slobbering and BARKING.
          The man turns toward Jeff, wiping his hands on his pants.
          Jeff tries again:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          I'm sure your ruins are better than
          these. It's just that we--
          The driver cuts him off, holding out his hand, with that same
          air of enraged disgust.

          DRIVER
          El dinero.
          Jeff gives him the money. Then the driver SLAPS the side of
          the truck, gestures for them to climb into the back.

          EXT. YUCATAN ROAD - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DAY

          Below us, the yellow truck travels along a single-lane road.
          Jeff and the others are in its rear. There are fields on
          either side of the road, bordered by thick jungle.
          The truck reaches a fork in the road, bears left, angling
          toward the wall of jungle, into which it vanishes, the
          overhanging foliage blocking it from sight.

          EXT. YUCATAN ROAD - IN THE JUNGLE - DAY

          The road is dirt, heavily rutted. There's a small clearing
          beside it, with a path opening off it. The trees grow over
          the path, forming a shady tunnel. WE HEAR birds calling, a
          steady throb of insect life, but otherwise all is silent.
          A beat, then there's the sound of the TRUCK approaching,
          along with the dog's BARKING and GROWLING. The pickup
          appears, moving slowly, bouncing and swaying across the ruts.
          The truck pulls into the little clearing, stops. Jeff and
          the others clamber out over its tailgate.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          The dog is still lunging at them from behind the truck's rear
          window. Jeff gives the driver a wave.

          JEFF
          Gracias, senor!
          The driver doesn't even look at him; he just pulls out onto
          the road, heading back in the direction from which they came.
          There are mosquitoes; Stacy starts to slap at herself. Jeff
          unslings his pack, pulls out a can of insect repellent.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Here.
          He begins to spray her, then Eric. Amy is peering off after
          the truck. They can still hear the dog's BARKING, but very
          faintly now. Jeff finishes with Eric, starts in on Mathias.

          AMY
          How do we get back?
          She points back down the road, toward the vanished truck.
          Jeff pauses in his spraying, considers for a moment. Then:

          JEFF
          The guidebook said you can always
          flag down a passing bus. So I--

          AMY
          There aren't going to be any buses
          on that road.
          Jeff nods; this seems obvious. He resumes spraying Mathias.
          Eric and Stacy stand there, watching.
          AMY (cont'd)
          A bus couldn't even fit.

          JEFF
          It also said you can hitch--

          AMY
          See any cars pass, Jeff?
          Jeff doesn't answer. He steps toward her, starts to spray
          her, too. She holds out her arms.
          AMY (cont'd)
          The whole time we were driving, you
          see even one?

          STACY
          Eric has his phone. Can't we just
          call someone?

          

          

          

          

          22.

          AMY
          He's not gonna get a signal. Not
          way out here.
          They all turn to watch as Eric reaches into. his pack, pulls
          out his cell phone, flips it open. He stares at it for a
          beat, then shakes his head, snaps it shut. Jeff finishes
          spraying Amy, starts in on himself.

          JEFF
          They must-have a way to get
          supplies in.

          AMY
          Who?

          JEFF
          The archaeologists. They must have
          a truck. Or access to a truck.
          When we find Mathias's brother, we
          can just ask them to take us all
          back to Coba.
          (turning to Mathias)
          Right?
          Mathias seems startled by the question.

          MATHIAS
          I guess ...I mean, I--
          He shrugs; he has no idea. Amy is still focused on Jeff:

          AMY
          We're stranded, aren't we? That's,
          like, a twenty mile walk we're
          gonna have to do. Through the
          jungle.

          JEFF
          Eleven.

          AMY
          What?
          Jeff finishes with the insect repellent, crouches to slide
          the can back into his pack.

          JEFF
          It's eleven miles.

          AMY
          There's no way that was eleven
          miles.

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Jeff rises, slings his pack. He gives Amy a tired look.

          JEFF
          Let's just find this place, okay?
          Then we can figure out how to get
          back.
          Amy is silent. Jeff turns to the others.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Ready?
          Mathias and Eric nod, and the boys start down the path. Amy
          stands there, watching them go. Stacy steps toward her.'

          STACY
          Just go with it, honey. You'll
          see--it'll all work out.
          She hooks arms with her, pulls her into motion.

          EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - MOVING - DAY

          They hike in single file: first Jeff, then Eric, Mathias,
          Stacy, and Amy. The path is six feet wide, hard-packed dirt.
          All around and above is the jungle: big-leafed plants, vines
          and creepers, immense trees.
          The path moves in snakelike curves; we can't see-very far in
          either direction. They're all sweating, their shirts
          clinging to their bodies. The bugs continue to harass them.

          STACY
          So-there was this girl who bought
          a piano.
          Amy gives a loud MOAN.

          ERIC
          But she didn't know how to play.

          STACY
          So she signed up for lessons.

          ERIC
          But she couldn't afford them.
          Stacy reaches, taps Mathias's shoulder.

          STACY
          You can play, too. If you want.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          Mathias glances back at her.
          STACY (cont'd)
          It's easy. Someone says So, then
          you say But. It's like catch, only
          without a ball.
          (to Eric)
          So she got a job in a factory.

          ERIC
          But was fired for being late.
          Amy takes off her hat, wipes the sweat from her face.

          AMY
          It's annoying.

          STACY
          So she became a prostitute.

          AMY
          It's tedious and boring. And once
          they start, it's impossible to get
          them to stop.

          ERIC
          But she fell in love with her first
          client.
          Amy puts her hat back on. She looks hot, sweaty, tired.

          AMY
          How much farther?
          Mathias peers down at his brother's note. Stacy and Eric
          continue with their game.

          MATHIAS STACY

          village, we've gone too far.
          AMY (cont'd) ERIC
          A village? But he was already married.

          MATHIAS STACY
          A Mayan village. So she begged him to get a
           divorce.
          AMY (cont'd) ERIC

          25.
          Mathias shrugs, returns the note to his pocket.

          MATHIAS STACY
          It just says there's a So she decided to kill her.
          village.
          AMY (cont'd)
          I think we should go see it.

          STACY
          Me, too.

          AMY
          I think we should---
          Jeff stops suddenly, pointing.

          JEFF
          The stream.
          Thirty feet in front of them, the trail dips toward a small
          stream, studded with boulders. It resumes on the far bank,
          rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway. The stream
          is slow moving, the water dark brown. Eric SNIFFS the air.

          ERIC
          Fucking smells.

          JEFF
          They must use it as a latrine.

          ERIC
          Who?

          JEFF
          The village. The Mayans.
          They start toward it, gingerly, the girls covering their
          noses. Jeff crosses the stream, hopping from boulder to
          boulder, and the others follow. Stacy almost falls in; she
          only catches her balance at the final instant, YELPING.
          Jeff is already starting up the trail, searching for the
          turnoff. There's no sign of it; the dense foliage extends
          unbroken as far as the eye can see. He turns to Mathias.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          How far past the stream?.

          MATHIAS
          Right after, it says.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          They stand there in a loose group, staring at the trees.
          Eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack, takes a swallow,
          then passes it to Stacy. Amy lifts her arm, points.

          AMY
          Look.
          Up the trail, sixty feet away, stand two small Mayan boys;
          they seem to have materialized out of the air. They're ten
          years old, shirtless, scrawny, dark-haired. one of them is
          holding a bicycle by its handlebars; it doesn't have a seat.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Maybe they can guide us.
          Stacy smiles toward the boys; she waves, CALLS OUT:

          STACY

          HOLAL
          The boys just stand there, staring at them, silent, their
          expressions wary, even frightened. One of them leans to
          whisper something to the other, who nods.

          ERIC
          Why don't we--
          He stops, noticing Mathias. The German is staring toward the
          edge of the trail, where a large bush sits. one of its
          fronds is very slowly dropping toward them, pulling itself
          free of the soil.
          Mathias steps forward, tugs at a second frond, which slips
          easily from the dirt. He tosses it aside, reaches for
          another frond: this, too, slips free. Someone has pushed
          them into the earth, arranging them to look like a bush.
          Mathias pulls a fourth frond free, then a fifth, and an
          opening is revealed in the brush, a narrow path winding its
          way off through the trees. They stand there a beat, staring
           at it. Then there's a SQUEAKING SOUND, and they all turn.

          AMY'S POV - UP THE TRAIL
          one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off, bent low over the
          bicycle's handlebars. His companion remains behind, staring
          toward us with a look of obvious anxiety.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Amy turns to Jeff; so do the others.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          AMY
          Why was it covered?
          Jeff lifts his hands: how should he know?

          STACY
          Maybe it's not the right path.
          NO one speaks. They keep staring from the boy to the newly
          revealed path, trying to make sense of it. WE can still HEAR
          the squeaking of the bicycle, growing steadily fainter.

          JEFF
          It's on the map.

          AMY
          It's a hand-drawn map, Jeff.

          STACY
          And it was hidden. Why would it be
          hidden?
          Jeff steps forward, shields his eyes, tries to peer into the
          dimness of the narrow path. Then he glances back toward the
          little boy, who continues to stand there, watching them.

          JEFF
          Maybe the archaeologists don't want
          people to find the mine.

          AMY
          Because?
          Jeff has to think. Finally:

          JEFF
          Maybe they've dug up something
          valuable. Emeralds or something.
          Or silver. Whatever they were
          mining in the first place. And
          they don't want anyone to come rob
          them. So they've asked the Mayans
          to help keep people away.
          He falls into silence, staring at the boy. No one appears
          very convinced by his theory, not even Jeff. He shrugs.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          How much farther is it?
          Mathias takes the map from his pocket again, glances at it.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          MATHIAS
          Not far.

          JEFF
          Be silly to stop now, don't you
          think?
          No one answers; no one moves.

          ANY
          This just feels weird, Jeff.
          Jeff SIGHS, fighting to suppress his impatience with her.

          JEFF
          So we what? Turn around? Walk all
          the way back to Coba?
          Silence. They all turn to stare back down the trail, then
          toward the Mayan boy, who's still watching them. Stacy SLAPS
          a mosquito, leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm. Jeff
          lifts his hand, gestures at the path.leading into the trees.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Come on. We're almost there.
          The others glance at one another, waiting for someone to
          argue; no one does. Finally, Mathias steps forward, slipping
          through the narrow opening. Eric follows him, and then, with
          just the slightest hesitation, so do Amy and Stacy.
          Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy--who's still
          standing there, sixty feet away, watching with his anxious
          expression--and then he, too, vanishes into the trees.

          EXT. NARROW PATH - MOVING - DAY

          They make their way along the winding path, one after
          another, all of them sweating, slapping at the mosquitoes.

          ERIC
          Maybe the ruins are sacred. You
          know? And they don't want people
          digging them up.
          He glances about, off into the trees, a little spooked.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          We could be walking through some
          sort of ancient graveyard right
          now. And they've--

          

          

          

          

          29.

          JEFF
          It's a mine. An old mining camp.

          ERIC
          So?

          JEFF
          There's nothing sacred about it.
          Eric considers this as they walk. The others are also quiet:
          too hot to speak. The sunlight falls through the trees in
          thin, shifting columns, hazed with mosquitoes.

          ERIC
          Maybe it leads to a marijuana
          field, then. Maybe the village is
          growing pot, and that boy rode off
          to get them, and they're gonna come
          with guns and--

          AMY
          Eric.

          ERIC
          What?

          AMY
          Shut up, okay?
          Eric falls silent. They follow the path as it curves first
          right, then left, moving gradually uphill all the while, and
          suddenly there's sunlight in front of them, bright and
          intense: a clearing. They hesitate at its edge, staring.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          The clearing is twenty yards wide, and extends in either
          direction as far as the eye can see, finally curving out of
          sight. Its soil is a deep black, flecked with white, like
          frost rime. It's completely free of vegetation.
          The path resumes on the far side of the clearing, winding its
          way up asmall hill. The hill is rocky, oddly treeless, and
          covered with a vinelike growth--a vivid green, with hand-
          shaped leaves and tiny red flowers.
          Jeff and the others step warily out onto the cleared ground,
          peering about, squinting in the sudden sunlight. They stare
          up at the flower-covered-hill.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          There are hints of ruins among the thick foliage: giant
          boulders with faint carvings etched onto their surfaces, the
          crumbling remains of a fallen pillar, everything half-buried
          beneath the vine.

          STACY
          It's beautiful.

          AMY
          So beautiful.

          STACY
          And the mosquitoes are gone. You
          realize that? They've stopped
          biting.
          She smiles at the others, delighted by this development. Amy
          removes the cap from her camera, starts to take pictures.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          WE HEAR a click as she takes each photo, and the image
          freezes for an instant.
          There's the hillside, covered in its vine, its red flowers:
          CLICK. There's Eric pulling the water bottle from his pack:
          CLICK. There's Stacy smiling at us, waving: CLICK. There's
          Mathias shading his eyes, peering up the hill.

          AMY (O.S.}
          Smile, Mathias.

          MATHIAS
          Is that a tent?
          He points.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Amy lowers her camera, turns to look.

          AMY'S POV - UP THE HILL
          An orange square of fabric is just visible, at the very top
          of the hill, billowing, sail-like, in the breeze. From this
          distance, with the rise of the hill partly blocking the view,
          its hard to tell what it is.

          

          

          

          

          31.

          BACK TO SCENE
          They all stand there, peering up the hill. Faintly, but
          growing steadily louder, a THUDDING noise comes from the
          jungle. The five of them turn, heads cocked, listening.

          JEFF
          A horse.
          It's true: HOOFBEATS are approaching at a gallop.
          Instinctively, Jeff and the others back a handful of steps
          toward the hill. A long. beat, then a horseman bursts into
          the clearing, rearing to a halt. Amy lifts her camera.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          A bald Mayan man is on the horse; he's broad-shouldered,
          short, in his early forties, dressed in a white shirt and
          pants. The horse rears a second time, and the image FREEZES
          for an instant, with a CLICK, as Amy snaps another picture.

          BACK TO SCENE
          The bald man SHOUTS at them in UNSUBTITLED MAYAN. His horse
          is lathered, SNORTING, rolling its eyes. It rears yet again,
          and the man half-falls, half-jumps to-the ground. Jeff and
          the others back a few more steps into the clearing.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          The bald man is still holding the reins; the horse is backing
          away from him, jerking its head, trying to break free,
          pulling him, step-by-step, back toward the trail. CLICK.

          BACK TO SCENE
          The man can't gain control of the horse. Finally, he drops
          the reins, and the horse gallops into the jungle, CRASHING
          through the trees, its hoofbeats gradually diminishing.
          The man turns toward them, starts YELLING in MAYAN again,
          pointing back down the trail. Sweat shines on his forehead.
          There's a gun on his belt, a black pistol in a brown holster.
          Stacy is clutching Eric's arm, looking frightened.

          STACY
          What's he saying?

          

          

          

          

          32.

          ERIC
          Maybe he wants money? A toll or
          something?
          The Mayan continues SHOUTING, waving his arm. Jeff reaches
          into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, removes a twenty.

          JEFF
          Dinero?
          The man ignores the proffered bill, makes a shooing motion,
          waving them from the clearing. Mathias turns toward the
          hill, cups his hands around his mouth, SHOUTS:

          MATHIAS

          HENRICHI
          There's no response, just the orange fabric gently billowing.

          JEFF
          Why don't you hike up, see if you
          can find him? We'll try to sort
          this out.
          Mathias nods, starts across the clearing. The bald man
          SHOUTS at him in Mayan, and then, when Mathias doesn't stop,
          pulls his pistol from its holster, FIRES into the sky.
          Everyone flinches, half-ducking. Stacy SCREAMS. Mathias
          goes still. The man waves at him, YELLING in Mayan, and
          Mathias comes back, his hands raised, to join the others.
          HOOFBEATS are approaching from the jungle again. They come
          closer and closer, and suddenly two more horsemen burst into
          the clearing. They're younger than the bald mans in their
          twenties, dark-haired, muscular. One has a mustache.
          Their mounts are white-eyed, SNORTING, rearing, just like the
          bald man's. The two men jump to the ground, dropping their
          reins, and the horses immediately turn and gallop back into
          the jungle. Amy lifts her camera again.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          The young men have bows slung across their chest, and quivers
          of thin, fragile-looking arrows. They question the bald man
          in MAYAN, very rapidly. He's still aiming his pistol at
          Mathias. A CLICK, and the image freezes for an instant.

          

          

          

          

          33.

          BACK TO SCENE
          As they continue to interrogate the bald man in MAYAN, the
          young men unsling their bows, each of them nocking an arrow.
          Reflexively, Jeff and the others retreat another handful of
          steps into the clearing. Mathias still has his hands raised.

          ERIC
          What the fuck?

          JEFF
          Quiet.

          ERIC

          THEY'RE--

          JEFF
          Wait. Wait and see.
          Amy is a bit farther into the clearing than Jeff and the
          others. She keeps swinging her camera from them to the
          Mayans, trying to capture the whole scene in one shot. She's
          too close, though,-and she retreats another handful of steps.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          Still backing up toward the hill; all of them but Stacy and
          Eric are in the frame now. The bald Mayan is still answering
          the young men's questions. He turns toward us suddenly,
          points his pistol directly at us,.starts to SHOUT.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff and the others turn, too, staring at Amy in surprise.
          She's nearly at the far edge of the clearing, peering through
          her camera; she retreats another step. The young Mayans
          raise their bows, drawing them; the bald man keeps YELLING.

          JEFF

          AMY--
          She takes another step; she's right up against the vines.

          AMY'S POV - THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER
          Stacy is in the frame now. We retreat one more step, and so
          is Eric, and the Mayans with their raised weapons, the bald
          man still SHOUTING: everything FREEZES on the CLICK.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Amy lowers her camera. The Mayan with the mustache turns to
          the other two, points toward her feet, SPEARING URGENTLY.
          The bald Mayan slowly lowers his pistol, looking dismayed.
          Amy glances down.

          AMY'S POV - HER FEET
          She's stepped out of the clearing, into the flowering vine.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Both of the younger Mayans are speaking now, their voices
          RISING. The bald Mayan is shaking his head, protesting, but
          they talk right over him. Amy steps clear of the vine,
          starts back toward Jeff, and the younger Mayans draw their
          bows taut again, aiming at her chest. She freezes.

          AMY

          JEFF---
          Jeff lifts his hand, without looking, his eyes on the Mayans.

          JEFF
          Don't move.
          The bald man continues to frown and shake his head. He
          points to Amy, then the others; he waves toward the jungle.
          But the young men are implacable--they keep arguing,
          gesturing--and finally the bald man gives in, falls SILENT.
          A beat, then the bald man raises his pistol, aims it at
          Jeff's chest. He makes a shooing motion with his other hand,
          but now it's toward Amy, and the hill beyond her.
          He begins to SHOUT; the other men do, too. Then the bald man
          FIRES a bullet into the dirt at Jeff's feet. Everyone jumps,
          starts to retreat. The men with the bows are swinging them
          back and forth, herding them toward the hill.
          When Jeff and the others reach Amy, the bald man points
          toward the trail, waves them up it. He watches--his
          expression looking stricken, close to tears--as the five of
          them obediently begin to climb the vine-covered hill.

          EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

          Midway up the hill, they pause to catch their breath.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          JEFF
          Check your phone, Eric.
          Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, stares at it.

          ERIC
          Nothing..
          He snaps it shut. They stand there: sweating, scared
          looking. Mathias cups his hands to his mouth again, SHOUTS:

          MATHIAS
          Henrich...I
          They all peer up the hill, waiting for a response.

          ERIC'S POV -- UP THE HILL
          It is a tent: bright orange, looking a bit worse for wear.
          The vine is growing up its aluminum poles as if on a trellis.
          .The tent faces away from us; its doorway is hidden. There's
          no sign or sound of any people.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Eric turns, glances back down the hill, shielding his eyes.

          ERIC
          There's another one.
          He points toward the clearing below them.

          ERIC'S POV THE CLEARING
          A fourth man has arrived, on a bicycle. He's dressed in
          white, like the others, with a straw hat on his head. A
          beat, then two more Mayans appear, also on bicycles. They
          all have bows slung over their shoulders.
          The bald man addresses these newcomers. He waves in either
          direction, and the other men start off along the clearing,
          two one way, three the other, leaving him alone at the base
          of the hill.
          A beat, then a little boy appears from the jungle--the one
          who'd watched them discover the camouflaged path. He and the
          bald man stand there, peering up at us.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Eric turns to the others, EXCITED:

          ERIC
          Let's run back down. Quick. While
          there's just him and the kid. We
          can rush them.

          STACY
          He's got a gun, Eric.
          This silences Eric--silences all of them. Mathias turns,
          SHOUTS toward the tent again.

          MATHIAS
          Henrich...1
          There's no answer. They wait another beat, then Jeff waves
          them back into motion.

          EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

          The hill is flat on top, forming a wide plateau. Beyond the
          orange tent is a small clearing of rocky ground. A blue tent
          sits on the far side of the clearing, looking just as
          weathered as the orange one, the vine growing up its poles.
          The five of them pause, peering about. Jeff CALLS OUT:

          JEFF
          Hello...?
          SILENCE. The vine covers everything but the trail and the
          clearing. We glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery: time-
          worn stelae, a low stone wall.
          In some places the vine folds back upon itself, forming waist-
          high mounds, tangled knoll-like profusions of green. And
          everywhere, hanging off it, are those bright red flowers.
          Mathias moves toward the orange tent, and Jeff follows him.
          They UNZIP its flap, stoop to peer inside.

          JEFF'S POV - INSIDE-THE ORANGE TENT
          The vine has taken root in here, too, growing on some things,
          leaving others untouched. There are three sleeping bags
          unrolled on the floor. An oil lamp. Two backpacks. A roll
          of duct tape. A bottle of tequila. A metal canteen.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff and Mathias ZIP the flap back shut. Eric, Stacy and Amy
          are fifteen feet away, watching.

          ERIC
          What's inside?

          JEFF
          Nothing. Some camping supplies.
          Mathias starts across the clearing toward the blue tent,
          followed by Jeff and the others. He UNZIPS its flap, sticks
          his head inside. Jeff leans to look, too.

          JEFF'S POV - INSIDE THE BLUE TENT
          The same thing: sleeping bags, backpacks, camping supplies.
          The vine is growing on some things, but not on.others.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Ten yards beyond the tent, there's a hole cut into the dirt.
          Stacy, Amy, and Eric have gathered at its edge; Jeff and
          Mathias join them. The hole is rectangular--ten feet by six
          feet--and very deep; we can't see its bottom.
          A windlass has been constructed beside the hole, a horizontal
          barrel with a hand crank welded to its base. Rope is coiled
          around the barrel. From there, it passes over a small wheel,
          which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the hole's mouth.
          Then it drops straight into the earth.

          AMY
          The mine?
          Jeff nods. A draft is rising from the hole, and it lifts off
          Amy's hat. She tries to catch it, but fumbles: the hat
          falls away from her. They all watch it vanish into the dark.
          Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, almost
          absentmindedly: a nervous gesture. There's still no signal.
          He closes it, turns to survey the clearing, the empty tents.

          ERIC
          Now what?
          Jeff shrugs, waves past the shaft. The clearing ends just a
          few yards from them;

          

          

          

          

          38.
          then the vines resume, and in the midst of the vines is the
          path. It winds its way to the edge of the hilltop, vanishes
          over it.

          JEFF
          Keep going, I guess.
          Saying this, he slings his pack onto his shoulder. Then he
          starts forward, the others falling in behind him.

          EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

          They pick their way down the trail. It's much steeper on
          this side; there are short stretches where they have to drop
          onto their rear ends and slide, one after another. It's
          after one of these that Jeff suddenly stops, staring.

          JEFF'S POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL
          It looks as if the jungle has been chopped down all the way
          around the base of the hill, isolating it in a ring of barren
          soil. One of the Mayans has made his way along this cleared
          ground to the base of the trail. He's staring up at them.

          ERIC (O.S.)
          Fuck.
          The man slides his bow off his shoulder, nocks an arrow. He
          shakes his head at them, CALLS OUT in MAYAN, waves them away.

          BACK TO SCENE
          The five of them stand there, staring down at the man.

          STACY
          What do we do?
          Jeff shrugs, starts forward again.

          JEFF
          We'll see.
          The others hesitate, and then, one after another, resume
          their downward march.

          EXT. BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          As they approach the clearing, the Mayan man YELLS what
          sounds like someone's name.

          

          

          

          

          39.
          A beat, then another bowman comes jogging into view. Jeff
          and the others stop at the bottom of the trail. They stand
          there, staring.
          The vine has invaded the clearing here. Ten feet in front of
          the path is one of those odd, knoll-like growths, knee-high,
          thick with flowers. The two Mayans are another twenty feet
          beyond it, in the center of the clearing, bows drawn.

          AMY
          So.
          Her skin is slick with sweat, and she's winded from the hike
          down. A third Mayan comes jogging toward them. He stops
          beside the other two, draws his bow.

          ERIC
          We should rush them. All at once.

          STACY
          Shut Up, Eric.

          ERIC
          Or go make shields. If we had some
          shields, we could--
          He falls silent as another Mayan comes running toward them.
          along the clearing. This one is bearded, heavier than the
          others. And he's carrying a rifle.

          ANY
          Oh my god.
          Jeff is staring at the little isolated island of vines, ten
          feet in front of them--peering intently at it.

          STACY
          Let's go back up.
          Jeff takes a step forward into the clearing--slowly, warily.
          STACY (cont'd)
          I wanna go back.
          Jeff takes another step, edging toward the mound, his eyes on
          the Mayans, their raised weapons. They just watch him.

          ANY

          JEFF--
          He ignores her, takes a third step, then a forth, which
          brings him to the mound of vines. He crouches, reaches into
          the tendrils, parting them. He grasps a stalk, tugs, pulls
          it free. WE SEE a tennis shoe, a sock, a man's shin.

          

          

          

          

          40.
          Jeff turns, stares at Mathias, who steps forward, crouches
          beside him, starts to pull at the vines, gently at first,
          then more aggressively, tearing them, the plant's sap shining
          on his skin, a low MOAN rising from his chest.
          Another shoe is revealed, another leg, a pair of jeans, a
          belt buckle, a black T-shirt. And then, finally: a young
          man's face, the flesh oddly eaten away, so that his cheekbone
          is visible, the white socket of his left eye.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Oh, no. Oh, Jesus.
          Jeff holds up his hand, silencing her. The Mayans stand
          there, in the center of the clearing, watching. Mathias has
          begun to rock slightly, that MOANING coming and going. Jeff
          touches his shoulder, WHISPERS:

          JEFF
          Easy. All right? Easy and slow.
          We'll stand up and we'll walk away.
          We'll walk back up the hill.
          The young man's T-shirt is stiff with dried blood. There are.
          three slender arrows impaled in his chest.

          MATHIAS
          It's my brother.

          JEFF
          I know.

          MATHIAS
          They killed him.
          Jeff nods, his hand still on Mathias's.shoulder; he squeezes.

          JEFF
          Shh. Not here. Up the hill, okay?
          Mathias is struggling to control his breathing; the MOANS
          keep coming. Finally, he manages a nod, and they both stand
          up. Stacy and Amy are holding hands, looking stricken.
          Stacy has started to CRY. Eric has his arm around her.
          The Mayans keep their weapons raised. They watch in silence
          as Jeff and the others turn to start back up the hill.

          EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

          Jeff and Mathias are at the top of the trail, staring down
          toward the clearing.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          JEFF'S POV - THE BOTTOM OF THE BILL
          More Mayans are appearing from the jungle. They're all
          armed. The bald man sends them out along the clearing, some
          in one direction, some 'the other.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff and Mathias stand there, grim-faced, watching. Mathias
          lifts his hands, stares at them. They've turned a deep, raw-
          meat red, as if scarred. He flexes his fingers, wincing.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy, Stacy, and Eric sit in the clearing, beside the shaft,
          passing a bottle of water among themselves. Eric is
          struggling to calm the girls:

          ERIC
          We can sneak past once the sun...-'
          sets, I bet. You know? Just reep
          by them in the dark?
          Stacy and Amy hardly seem to hear him; they look dazed,
          distraught. Eric passes the bottle to Stacy. A beat, then:
          ERIC (cont'd)
          And then there's the girl.

          AMY
          The girl?

           ERIC
          The one his brother met. What
          happened to her?
          Amy and Stacy are silent. Stacy lifts the water bottle to
          her lips, but immediately lowers it, and starts to CRY again.
          Amy takes her hand. Eric watches them, silent. Then:
          ERIC (cont'd)
          And the archaeologists. You think--
          Stacy's crying deepens toward a SOB. Amy gives Eric a look.

          AMY
          Stop it, Eric.

          ERIC
          What?

          

          

          

          

          42.

          AMY
          Just stop, okay? Stop talking.
          Stacy struggles to collect herself, breathing deep. She
          wipes at her face. Amy keeps stroking her hand.
          Jeff and Mathias are approaching across the hilltop. Mathias
          holding his burned-looking hands out in front of him. He
          9 a nd Jeff crouch beside the others.

          ERIC
          What happened?
          Jeff takes the bottle from Stacy. He pours a tiny bit of
          water on Mathias's hands.

          JEFF
          There's something in the plants.
          The sap--it burned his skin.
          Mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt, grimacing. Amy
          reaches to take the water back from Jeff. She starts to lift
          the bottle to her mouth, but..Teff leans forward, grabs it.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Don't. We need to save it.

          AMY
          But I'm thirsty.

          JEFF
          We all are.

          AMY
          So let's drink.
          Jeff shakes his head, capping the bottle.

          JEFF
          We don't have that much. We need
          to ration it.
          (he glances up at the sky)
          We'll have to figure out a way to
          catch the rain.
          Everyone but Amy peers up at the sky: it's a perfect,
          cloudless blue. Amy remains focused on Jeff.

          AMY
          I'm hungover. I'm sunburned. I
          lost my hat. I need some water.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          JEFF

          AMY--

          AMY
          Why do you get to decide?
          Jeff stares at her, considering this. Then he shrugs.

          JEFF
          Fine. Let's vote.
          (he glances at the others)
          But first you should understand
          that each of us is gonna need half
          a gallon of water a day, at a
          minimum, to survive here. That's
          two and a half gallons total, every
          day. And right now, until it
          rains, we don't have it. Okay?
          Not even one day's worth.
          (a beat)
          Now who wants to give Amy more
          water?
          A long moment of silence. No one can meet Amy's eyes.
          Finally, VERY QUIETLY:

          STACY
          Maybe we should just wait, honey.

          ANY
          Till?
          Everyone looks toward Jeff.

          JEFF
          Another hour or so. Then we'll all
          have a sip. Okay?
          Amy can see that she has no choice. She gives a grudging
          nod, and Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We have to get organized. Now.
          While we're still fresh. We'll
          have to stay out of the sun, spend
          as much time as possible in the
          tents. We'll have to--

          STACY
          Can't we sneak away when it gets
          dark? Eric said we--

          

          

          

          

          44.
          Jeff shakes his head, cutting her off. He waves across the
          hilltop, toward where he and Mathias had been standing.

          JEFF
          They keep coming. More and more of
          them. They're all armed, and the
          bald one sends them out along the
          clearing. They're surrounding us.
          Amy, Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this. Finally:

          ERIC
          Why don't they just kill us?

          JEFF
          It's got something to do with the
          hill, I think. Once you step on
          it, you're not allowed off.
          Something like that. They won't
          step on it themselves, but now that
          we're here, they won't let us
          leave. So we have to figure out a
          way to survive till someone comes
          and finds-us.

          AMY
          Who?
          Jeff lifts one hand, palm-up, half a shrug.

          JEFF
          People'll start to worry when we
          don't return home. Right? And

          THEY'LL--

          AMY
          We're not supposed to leave till
          Friday.
          Jeff nods.
          AMY (cont'd)
          And they'll have to come searching.
          Again, he nods.
          AMY (cont'd)
          So you're talking--what, a week?

          .JEFF
          Something like that.
          Amy looks appalled; her voice JUMPS:

          

          

          

          

          45.

          AMY
          We can't live here for a week,
          Jeff.

          JEFF
          If we try to leave, they'll shoot
          us. That's the one thing we know
          for certain.
          An electronic CHIRPING comes from the shaft: it sounds like
          a cell phone ringing. Mathias turns his head, listening. No
          one else notices it.

          AMY
          But what will we eat? How will we--
          The RINGING comes again, silencing her. She glances toward
          the shaft, not quite believing what she's hearing. It comes
          a THIRD TIME, and they all stand up, step to the hole, peer
          into its darkness. The RINGING comes yet again.

          STACY
          A cell phone.

          AMY
          It can't be--

          JEFF
          That's a cell phone, Amy.
          Definitely.

          .AMY
          But there's no signal out here.
          Eric can't get a signal.
          Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again:
          nothing. There's another RING.

          JEFF
          It could be a different network.
          Something local.

          AMY
          Way down in that hole? How could
          it pick it up?
          Still another RING.

          ERIC
          What else can it be?

          

          

          

          

          46.
          The RINGING falls SILENT. They all stand there, staring into
          the hole. A long beat, then it RESUMES. Eric CLAPS his
          hands, ecstatic. The others are starting to smile, too.
          Mathias moves to the windlass. He unrolls some of the rope,
          starts to wrap it around his chest. Jeff watches him.
          Another RING.
          The vine has taken root on the windlass:- the sawhorse, the
          barrel, the rope. Jeff steps forward, begins to yank it off,
          careful not to get the sap on his hands. He turns to Amy.

          JEFF
          There's a lamp in the orange tent.
          See if you can find some matches,
          too.
          Amy hurries off toward the orange tent, vanishing inside.
          There's a final RING, and then SILENCE again. Mathias is
          knotting the rope tightly around his chest.
          Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches.
          Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp. Then he
          rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You sure?
          Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the hole.
          Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves
          at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut.
          Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole. He dangles
          there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the
          windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and Eric begin to
          reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out.
          Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it,
          watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet, twenty
          feet, thirty feet down, and still only darkness beneath him,
          with no sign of the shaft's bottom.
          The windlass CREAKS as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against
          it, sweating, muscles taut. Amy has turned from the shaft,
          is watching: the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel.

          AMY
          Jeff.
          He turns to look, and she points at the rope, where it comes
          off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel
          hanging from the sawhorse.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          AMY (cont'd)
          The sap...
          They'd cleared off most of the vine from the rope, but not
          all of it. Some of these remaining tendrils have been
          crushed as the windlass slowly unspools. Their sap is
          darkening the rope in spots, eating into it.
          AMY (cont'd)
          I think it's--
          Jeff immediately turns back to the crank, his voice URGENT:

          JEFF
          Pull him up !
          Eric hasn't grasped what's happening. He hesitates.
          JEFF (cont'd)

          NOWT
          Amy jumps forward to help, all three of them pushing at the
          crank, getting in each other's way, the windlass CREAKING as
          it begins to turn again, slowly reclaiming the rope. Stacy
          remains beside the shaft, peering anxiously into it.

          STACY'S POV - THE SHAFT
          Mathias is twenty-five feet beneath us, just beginning to
          bump his way upward, swaying back and forth. He stares up at
          us, CONFUSED:

          MATHIAS
          What is it?
          The rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away,
          its hemp unraveling.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Stacy turns toward the others, pointing, terrified.

          STACY

          IT'S--
          The rope SWAPS. Jeff, Eric and Amy fall forward, the
          windlass spinning wildly behind them, free'of its weight. A
          long beat, then there's a distant, hollow-sounding THUMP,
          followed instantly by the POP of the lamp shattering.
          Stacy leans to peer into the shaft, her hand over her mouth.

          

          

          

          

          48.

          STACY'S POV - THE SHAFT
          Darkness. Silence.

           STACY (O.S.)
          Mathias...?
          Her voice ECHOES back at us. There's no response.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff, Eric, and Amy join Stacy at the edge of the shaft, all
          of them staring down into the darkness, looking horrified.

          ERIC
          Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck.

          AMY
          Is he--
          There's a GROAN from below, very faint, almost inaudible.

          JEFF
          He's moaning.
          They listen for a beat, but there's only silence.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          I heard him moan.
          The others don't seem so certain; Jeff turns to the girls.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          One of you will have to go.

          AMY
          Go?
          Jeff nods, waving into the shaft.

          JEFF
          Down. We'll clear the vine off the
          rope. And you can--

          AMY
          Why can't you? Or Eric?

          JEFF
          We have to work the crank. You
          won't be strong enough.

          

          

          

          

          49.
          Amy and Stacy stare at each other; it's obvious neither of
          them wants to go. Stacy is the one who finally gives in.

          STACY
          I can do it.

          AMY

          (RELIEVED)
          You sure?
          Stacy nods, but she doesn't look sure. She's hugging
          herself; it seems as if she might start trembling. Before
          anyone can speak, that GROANING comes from the shaft again,
          louder this time, unmistakable. Jeff cups his hands, SHOUTS:

          JEFF
          Mathias...?
          More SILENCE. Jeff turns to the girls.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          See if you can find a knife. And
          another lamp.'
          He waves them toward the tents; then he and Eric begin to
          unspool the rope from the windlass, laying it out across the
          clearing in long, looping circles.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          The Mayans keep coming: women now, too, bearing bundles on
          their backs. They're setting up a campsite along the edge of
          the jungle. The bald man stands in their midst, his hands on
          his hips, staring silently up the hillside.

          CU - OIL LAMP
          The SCRATCH of a match being lit: Amy's hand comes into
          frame, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, fires the wick.

          JEFF (0.S.)
          Just help him into the sling. Then
          we'll pull him up.
          The chimney is carefully replaced, as WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy is crouched, adjusting the lamp's flame. Jeff and Eric
          have mended the rope.

          

          

          

          

          50.
          WE SEE the excised lengths of spoiled hemp, and the ragged-
          looking knots on the rope itself, which has been spooled once
          more around the windlass.
          They've fashioned a sling at the rope's end. Jeff and Eric
          are helping Stacy into it, pulling it over her head,
          adjusting it under her armpits.

          JEFF
          Once we get him out, we'll drop the
          rope back down and pull you up,
          too.
          Amy offers Stacy the lamp. Stacy is scared, yet struggling
          not to show it. Her hands are trembling, and the lamp
          rattles as she takes it. The boys are stepping toward the
          windlass; Eric stops, glances back at her.

          ERIC
          You okay?
          Stacy nods, but without much conviction. Eric steps toward
          her, gives her a tight hug. He holds her eyes for a moment,
          kisses her. Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank. They lean
          against it, and the rope goes taut.
          Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft, the lamp in
          her right hand. With her left hand, she lunges, grabs at the
          sawhorse, clings tightly to it. Jeff glances toward her from
          the hand crank.

          JEFF
          Ready?
          She nods, but doesn't relinquish her grip on the sawhorse.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You have to let go, Stacy.
          For a moment, it doesn't seem like she'll be able to, but
          then--with a visible act of will--she does, and they slowly.
          begin to let the rope out, dropping her into the shaft.

          ON STACY - IN THE SLING
          She grips the sling with one hand, the lamp with the other.
          Wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the
          shaft, buttressing the dirt. The vine clings to them, its
          leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above.
          Stacy begins to swing, pendulum-like, as she descends. She
          tries unsuccessfully to steady herself, then glances up.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
          We're steadily dropping: thirty feet down, then forty. Amy
          is at the edge of the shaft, peering in at us. She waves.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Stacy smiles up at her. She starts to wave back, but is too
          scared to let go of the sling. She glances down.

          STACY'S POV - BENEATH HER
          The light is swaying back and forth with Stacy, and it causes
          the shadows beneath us to jump and lurch. There's still no
          sign of the bottom; the windlass continues to CREAK.
          A beat, and then, very faintly, Mathias's dim shape starts to
          emerge: his white tennis shoes, his pale blue T-shirt. The
          lamp picks up bits of broken glass around his body.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Stacy lifts the lamp, peering downward, struggling to see
          more clearly, and the sling suddenly jerks to a halt, making
          her SQUAWK. She looks up.

          STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
          The CREAKING has stopped. We're swinging slowly back and
          forth. WE SEE Amy peering down toward us: a long way up,
          almost seventy feet. A beat, then Jeff appears, too.

          JEFF
          Stacy?
          His voice has an ECHO to it.

          BACK TO SCENE - STACY
          Her face is slick with sweat; it shines-in the lamp light.

          STACY
          What?

          JEFF (O.S.).
          It's the end of the rope.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          STACY
          I'm not at the bottom.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Can you see him?
          Stacy looks down again, holding up the lamp, peering toward
          Mathias's motionless body. She lifts her head.

          STACY
          A little.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Is he conscious?

          STACY
          I can't tell. I don't think so.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          How far are you above him?
          Stacy glances down once more, trying to quess,the distance.

          STACY
          Fifteen feet?
          (a beat)
          He's just lying there.
          She lifts her head again, peers upward.

          STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
          The top of the shaft is empty. Very faintly, WE HEAR Jeff
          and the others talking, just their voices, not their words.

          STACY (O.S.)
          Jeff ... ?
          Jeff's head reappears.

          JEFF
          We have to figure out a way to
          lengthen the rope. We're gonna
          pull you up.
          He pulls his head away.

          BACK TO SCENE - STACY
          She's staring upward.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          STACY
          Wait!
          The rope has almost stopped its swaying.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

          Jeff steps back to the hole, peers into it. So does Amy.
          Eric waits by the windlass. The rope is completely played
          out. Stacy SHOUTS, her voice ECHOING slightly:

          STACY (O.S.)
          I want to stay with him.

          JEFF
          You can't. We have to--

          STACY (O.S.)
          I'll jump.
          Jeff glances at the others. Eric shakes his head. Jeff
          CALLS down to her:.

          JEFF
          We might not be able to make it
          longer. You'll be trapped.

          STACY (O.S.)
          What about him? We can't just
          leave him.

          JEFF
          We'll pull you up. Then we'll see.
          He starts toward the windlass again.

          ON STACY - IN THE SLING
          The rope jerks, and she begins to rise. She kicks her legs,
          lifts her left arm over head, wrenches it free of the sling,
          so that only her right arm remains hooked. She switches the
          lamp from her right hand to her left, then slips completely
          free of,the sling, the lamp fluttering out as she drops.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          Almost totally dark, just a faint fall of light from above.
          Mathias is a dim shape on the floor of the shaft. Stacy
          lands beside him--heavily, awkwardly--the glass from his
          shattered lamp CRUNCHING beneath her.

          

          

          

          

          54.
          She loses her balance, pitches forward, onto his body.
          MATHIAS makes a terrible SHRIEKING sound, pure pain, flailing
          his arms. Stacy struggles to right herself.

          STACY
          I'm sorry. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
          She pulls herself into a crouch, staring down at him through
          the dimness, his SHRIEK fading to a steady MOANING.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

          Jeff, Amy, and Eric have rushed to the shaft; they're peering
          into it. There's only darkness beneath them. Eric SHOUTS:

          ERIC
          Stacy...?
          Stacy's voice rises toward them, sounding. very FAR AWAY:

          STACY (O.S.)
          I didn't want him to be alone.

          JEFF
          What happened to the lamp?

          STACY (O.S.)
          It blew out.
          Jeff turns from the shaft, picks up the box of matches. He
          yanks off his shirt, ties the box inside it, then steps back
          to the edge of the hole. He CALLS down to Stacy:

          JEFF
          I'm dropping the matches. Okay?

          STACY (O.S.)
          Okay.
          Jeff holds the knotted bundle over the shaft, lets it go. It
          falls into the darkness. A long beat, and then, very softly,
          WE HEAR the thump as it lands.
          STACY (O.S.) (cont'd)
          Got it.
          The three of them stare into the hole, waiting for the light.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          There's the RASP of a match, its flickering flame, then the
          stronger illumination of the lamp as Stacy lights its wick.
          Mathias lies on his back before her, silent now, motionless,
          his eyes shut. Stacy bends toward him, WHISPERS:

          STACY
          Mathias...?
          He doesn't respond; it's hard to tell if he's conscious.
          Stacy lifts the lamp, peers about the shaft. The vine has
          taken root even at this depth, its flowers and leaves pale to
          the point of translucence.
          Beyond Mathias, there's an opening in the dirt wall, another
          shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth. Its roof is
          supported by a stone archway, intricately carved. Stacy
          rises, as if to investigate, but then winces, nearly falls.
          She peers down at her right leg. A large piece of glass is
          imbedded there, just beneath her knee. it's the size of a
          playing card, gently concave,'dark with her blood. She
          reaches and, grimacing, pulls it from her body.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

          Jeff is at the windlass, hurriedly cranking the rope back up.
          Eric and Amy stand watching.

          JEFF
          We need fifteen feet. Twenty to be
          safe.
          No one speaks. The windlass turns with that steady CREAKING,
          but it's higher-pitched now, with no weight on the rope.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Come on. Think. How can we--

          ERIC
          The clothes? From the backpacks?
          We could knot them together?

          JEFF
          Would they hold?
          Eric frowns, uncertain. Jeff finishes with the rope, stands
          there, catching his breath. Stacy's,voice rises toward them
          from the shaft:

          

          

          

          

          56.

          STACY (O.S.)
          I cut my knee.
          Eric hurries to the shaft, followed by Jeff and Amy. They
          peer over its edge, toward Stacy, so far beneath them, in her
          flickering circle of lamp light.

          ERIC
          Bad?

          STACY
          My shoe's full of blood.

          JEFF
          Put pressure on it. Use my shirt.
          They all stare down at her, waiting.

          TOE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          Stacy is crouched beside Mathias, pressing Jeff's T-shirt to
          her wound. Her khakis and tennis shoe are dark with blood;
          there's a lot of it. She isn't watching Mathias; he startles
          her when he opens his eyes and speaks:

          MATHIAS
          My...legs...
          His voice is faint and RASPY; we can hear his pain in it.
          Stacy leans toward him, tries to smile reassuringly.

          STACY
          Hey...

          MATHIAS
          Can't... move ...my...legs...
          Stacy turns to look: his legs are lying at an odd angle, as
          if he were a doll that had been carelessly tossed there.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

          Jeff, Eric and Amy, still watching; Jeff turns to the others.

          JEFF
          What about the tents? We could
          take one down, cut the nylon into
          strips.
          Eric and Amy glance toward the tents, debating.

          

          

          

          

          57.

          ERIC
          Would it be strong enough?

          JEFF
          we can braid them--three strips for
          each section. Then knot the
          sections together, for strength.
          Before either of them can respond, Stacy's voice emerges from
          the shaft, sounding SCARED:

          STACY (O.S.)
          I think he broke his back.
          They fall silent, staring down at her.
          STACY (O.S.) (cont'd)
          He can't move his legs. And it
          smells.

          JEFF
          Smells?

          STACY (O.S.)
          Like he lost his bowels. His
          bladder.

          AMY
          (very quietly)
          Oh no. Please no.
          Jeff turns to her.

          JEFF
          How can we make a backboard?
          Amy starts to shake her head, looking horrified.

          AMY
          No, Jeff. No way. We can't move
          him.

          JEFF
          One of the frames from the
          backpacks? And the tent poles.
          There's tape in the orange tent.
          He doesn't wait for a response; he leans over the shaft,

          SHOUTS:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We have to builda backboard,
          Stacy. It might take a while.

          

          

          

          

          58.
          There's a long hesitation, as if Stacy is searching for some
          alternative. Then, still sounding FRIGHTENED and FARAWAY:

          STACY (O.S.)
          Okay.
          Amy is shaking her head, growing FRANTIC:

          AMY
          We'll make it worse. Well jostle
          him, and he'll--
          Jeff turns toward her, with a hint of EXASPERATION:

          JEFF
          We can't just leave him down there.
          You know that, don't you?
          She starts to back away, toward the edge of the clearing.

          AMY
          we have to tell them.

          JEFF
          Who?

          AMY
          The Mayans. We have to tell them
          what's happened.
          Jeff gives her an incredulous look. She keeps retreating;
          she's almost at the path.
          AMY (cont'd)
          They can send for help.

          JEFF
          They're not gonna---

          AMY
          We have to may. We have to--
          She spins, starts off at a run, vanishing down the trail.
          Jeff calls after her, SHOUTING:

          JEFF
          Amy!
          But she's gone. Jeff turns to Eric.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Stay here.

          

          

          

          

          59.
          And then he, too, is running.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          The Mayans have established their campsite on the edge of the
          jungle. Two women are beside a campfire, plucking a pair of
          chickens. WE SEE other campsites in the distance, other
          campfires, hugging the jungle's margin, surrounding the hill.
          Three men sit in the center of the clearing, facing the
          hillside, their bows in their laps. They rise suddenly,
          peering up the trail. The women pause in their labor, also
          staring. The campsite goes QUIET.

          THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL
          Amy is sprinting toward us down the trail. Jeff is ten yards
          behind her, also running.

          BACK TO SCENE
          The three Mayans nock arrows. Two other men step forward to
          join them. One has a bow; the other is the bald Mayan, with
          the pistol. He unholsters it, and--as Amy reaches the bottom
          of the trail--raises it, aiming at her chest.
          Amy stops just short of the clearing: sweating, breathless,
          scared-looking. She lifts her hands, palms-up, beseeching.

          AMY
          Help us. Please. Someone's been
          hurt. He--
          Jeff comes to a halt, five feet behind her.

          JEFF
          They can't understand you.
          She turns, her voice quickened with PANIC:

          AMY
          Say it in Spanish. Tell them he--

          JEFF
          They don't speak Spanish.

          AMY
          Try it. You have to try.

          

          

          

          

          60.
          She spins back toward the Mayans, takes a step into the
          clearing. The bald man SHOUTS at her, a single short
          sentence in MAYAN. Amy holds out her hands to him.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Espanol? Habla Espanol?
          Jeff steps forward, grabs her elbow.

          JEFF
          They killed Henrich. Why would-
          Amy tries to tug free, but he won't let her. She starts to
          SHOUT at the Mayans:

          AMY
          Help usi We need help!
          The Mayans just stare at her, their weapons raised, their
          faces expressionless. one of them is much younger than the
          others, almost a boy. He says something in MAYAN to the bald
          man, and the bald man shakes his head.
          Amy begins to CRY. Jeff pulls at her elbow.

          JEFF
          We have to get back.
          Amy turns toward him, her face smeared with tears.

          AMY
          I didn't want to come. I told you
          we shouldn't. I said--
          Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake,
          as if to wake her up.

          JEFF
          Listen to me. Mathias needs our
          help. Right now. He--

          AMY
          We shouldn't even be here. Why did
          you say we'd come?
          (she wipes at her tears)
          You have to do something.
          (rising toward a shout)
          You have to! It's your fault.
          It's all your--
          Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap:

          

          

          

          

          61.

          JEFF
          YD-q stepped onto the hill.
          Amy stares at him, startled into silence.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          They wouldn't have forced us up it
          if you hadn't.
          He holds her eyes, making sure she understands. Then:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Now let's go, okay?
          He starts to pull her back toward the trail. She allows
          herself to be led; she's begun to CRY again:

          AMY
          I didn't know. I just--
          She's growing increasingly upset, almost SOBBING. She tries
          to turn back toward the Mayans again, but Jeff won't let her.
          AMY (cont'd)
          They have to help us.

          JEFF
          They're not going to.

          AMY
          They have to.
          She wrenches herself free, stumbles, falls into the vines
          beside the trail. Jeff reaches for her, but she kicks away
          from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her feet.
          As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging
          from its roots. She SCREAMS, spinning toward the clearing---
          AMY (cont'd)

          WHY WON'T YOU FUCKING HELP US?
          --and throws the tendril at the Mayans. They scramble
          backward, with surprising panic, SHOUTING. The youngest of
          them is too slow: the length of vine hits him in the leg.
          He stares down at the tendril in shock.
          The others back hurriedly away from him. Two of them
          continue to point their weapons at Amy, but the bald man and
          one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now.
          There's SHOUTING from the tree line. The entire campsite is
          on its feet; a woman begins to SCREAM.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          She's in her,forties, short and stout, and she starts forward
          into the clearing, arms stretched toward the young Mayan.
          Two of the other women grab her, hold her back.
          The bald Mayan starts to ADDRESS the young man, pointing up
          the hillside. The short woman keeps SCREAMING, flailing,
          trying to break free. The young Mayan looks at her, then at
          the bald man. He speaks in MAYAN, a brief burst of words.
          The bald man shakes his head, points up the hill again, his
          pistol aimed at the young man's chest. The short woman is
          WAILING, eyes shut. The young Mayan takes a step toward her,
          CALLING what seems to be her name.
          The bald man SHOUTS at him, but the young Mayan ignores him,
          takes a second step, then a third. The bowmen are all aiming
          at him now, and suddenly, everyone seems to be YELLING.
          The young Mayan takes a fifth step, holding out his arms
          toward the WAILING woman, CALLING to her. The bald man
          FIRES, shooting him in the head. At the same instant, the
          bowmen let their arrows fly, the shafts THUMPING into the
          young man's chest, burying themselves to the fletches.
          The clearing goes still; the only sound is the woman's steady
          WAILING. Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and
          Jeffs he SHOUTS in MAYAN at them. The other Mayans nock
          fresh arrows, draw their bows.
          Jeff takes a step backward, half-raising his hands. Amy just
          stands there, her eyes on the young Mayan's motionless body.

          JEFF

          AMY...
          (no reaction)

          AY.
          She turns, finally. She looks horrified, stupefied; her
          hands are burned a deep red from the vine's sap. Jeff waves
          her up the hill. She stares at him for another beat, and
          then, without a word, starts to climb the trail.
          Jeff hesitates, watching the Mayans: the bloodied corpse,
          the raised weapons, the KEENING woman. Then he, too, turns
          and hurries off up the trail.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy, Jeff, and Eric have taken down the blue tent; its
          contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing. All
          three of them look sun struck, sweat-stained, worn out.

          

          

          

          

          63.
          Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon.
          Amy is braiding three of the strips together. Jeff has one
          of the backpack frames, the roll of duct tape, and some of
          the poles from the tent; he's making a backboard.

          ERIC
          Maybe we could use it as a weapon,
          you know? Wrap it around some
          stones or something. And throw
          them, like grenades. I mean, if
          they're that scared of it--
          Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth.

          JEFF
          They have guns, Eric. And bows.
          What do you think they'll do if we
          start throwing the vine at them?
          Eric is silenced by this. He cuts another long strip of
          nylon, passes it to Amy. But he can't seem to stop himself
          from talking:

          ERIC.
          So you figure it's, what? Sacred
          or something? Like, you touch it
          and you have to die?
          Amy begins to cry suddenly--a SOB, quickly suppressed. Jeff
          and Eric both turn to look at her. The vine's sap has
          scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows. She wipes
          her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head.

          AMY
          I'm okay.
          But she doesn't look it. Jeff removes his hat, holds it out.
          Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take it.

          JEFF
          Come on. You're burning.
          She reaches for the hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes
          again. Jeff leans forward, touches her.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We're gonna get through this. All
          right? We'll pull them up. And
          then ...I don't know--we'll figure
          things out. it has to rain at some
          point. And maybe we can snare some
          birds. Or--

          

          

          

          

          64.
          The electronic RINGING sounds once more from the bottom of
          the shaft. They all turn to stare.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          The oil lamp has begun to smoke, adding a haze to the light.
          Stacy is beside Mathias, holding his hand. She's still
          pressing Jeff's shirt to her wound. The RING sounds again.
          Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the
          dirt wall to his left: that's where it's coming from. Stacy
          reaches to pick up the lamp, rises to her feet. Another
          RING. Jeff SHOUTS down from above:

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Stacy...?
          Stacy ignores him; she limps around Mathias, starts toward
          the opening. She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft,
          lifting her lamp to see better. There's another RING.

          -STACY'S POV -- INTO THE SHAFT
          The lamp's light doesn't penetrate very far, but WE can SEE
          that the vine has taken root here with great avidity: it
          grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof. There's a steady
          draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it, RUSTLING.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Stacy stands there, looking scared. There's another RING.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Can you see it?
          Stacy lifts her head, SHOUTS:

          STACY
          No.
          She keeps peering into the shadows, not moving. The ringing
          falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and
          the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it:
          the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others:
          STACY (cont'd)
          The lamp's almost out of oil.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Then blow it out.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          Stacy seems terrified by this.

          STACY
          Blow it out?

          JEFF (0.5.)
          We'll need it when we come down.
          To get him on the backboard.
          Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down
          before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn't want to blow
          it out. Mathias watches her, silent.
          JEFF (O.S.) (cont'd)
          All right?
          Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows
          out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK

          The.sun is just touching the horizon, the sky turning red.
          Th ey've tied the braids of nylon onto the rope, attached the
          finished backboard to them. It rests beside the shaft,
          padded with one-of the archaeologist's sleeping bags.
          Jeff and Eric remove their belts, drop them onto the
          backboard. They step to the windlass, lean against its hand
          crank, the rope going taut. Amy stands by the shaft,
          gathering her courage. Then she reaches for the backboard.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness. The
          windlass begins its CREAKING. A long beat, and then:

          AMY (O.S.)
          Stacy?

          STACY
          What?

          AMY -(0.5.)
          Light the lamp!
          Stacy shifts; once again, there's the RASP of a match, then
          the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick.
          Mathias's eyes are shut; there's a deep RAGGEDNESS to his
          breathing. Stacy looks upward.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER
          The backboard is dropping toward us. Above it, the light is
          already fading from the sky.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the lamp.

          ON AMY - CROUCHING ON THE BACKBOARD
          She's dropping slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon
          braids, her eyes tightly shut: terrified. The backboard
          sways, pendulum-like, as it descends, almost touching the
          vine-covered walls.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          When the backboard comes within reach, Stacy grabs it,
          pulling it to the-right, so that it will come to rest at
          Mathias's side. But then, with three feet still to go, it
          jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch.
          A beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above:

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Have you reached them?

          AMY
          Almost. A few more feet.

          JEFF (O.S.}
          How many?
          Amy leans, peers down at Mathias's broken body.

          AMY
          I don't know. Three?

          JEFF (O.S.}
          we're out of rope.
          (a beat)
          Can you still do it?
          Amy looks at Stacy; neither speaks. Finally, QUIETLY:

          STACY
          We'll have to send it back up, I
          guess.

          

          

          

          

          67.
          Amy doesn't answer. She shifts her weight, and the backboard
          starts to swing. Stacy reaches to steady it.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Blow out the lamp. Wait here in
          the dark.
          Amy is silent, staring down at Mathias's still form; it's
          obvious she doesn't want to do this.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Or we could try to lift him, maybe.
          More silence. Stacy persists:
          STACY (cont'd)
          One of us at his shoulders. The
          other his feet.

          AMY
          If he twists--

          STACY
          It's only a few feet.
          /"- Once more, Amy is silent. Stacy lifts the lamp, examining
          it, the diminishing pool of oil.
          STACY (cont'.d)
          We have to decide. The light's not
          going to last.
          Jeff's voice comes toward them from above again:

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Amy...?
          They both look up; the sky has grown too dark to see him.
          Amy hesitates one beat more, then YELLS:

          AMY
          We're gonna try itt
          She climbs off the backboard, crouches beside Mathias. Stacy
          sets down the lamp.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Mathias...?
          She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at
          her. He looks haggard, ashen.

          10111..

          

          

          

          

          68.
          AMY (cont'd)
          We're going to lift you, okay?
          We're going to hoist you up and
          out.
          Mathias stares from her to the backboard to Stacy. He shuts
          his eyes. Amy stands up, drags the belts off the backboard,
          drops them next to the lamp. She positions herself behind
          Mathias's head; Stacy hobbles to his feet, limping.
          AMY (cont'd)
          His hips.
          Stacy hesitates, looking doubtful.

          STACY
          You sure?

          AMY
          If you lift from his feet, he'll
          bend at the waist.

          STACY
          But if I lift at his hips, won't he
          arch his back?
          They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different
          scenarios. Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil.

          AMY
          His knees.
          Stacy crouches by Mathias's knees, a little off balance,
          favoring her wounded leg. Amy bends, sliding her hands under
          his shoulders. Mathias GROANS, and Stacy starts to pull
          away, but Amy shakes her head.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Quickly. On three.
          They count together:

          STACY AND AMY
          One ... two.-,.three.
          They lift, and Mathias immediately starts to SCREAM. His
          body sags at the waist; he begins to thrash his arms. Stacy
          starts to set him down, but Amy shakes her head, SHOUTS:

          AMY
          No!

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Stacy's wounded leg is hindering her; she can't keep up with
          Amy. Mathias's shoulders are level with the backboard, but
          his knees are still a good foot beneath it. He keeps
          SCREAMING. The bend at his waist increases.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Lift I
          Stacy tries to hoist him higher, lunging, his torso twisting,
          his SCREAMS going LOUDER. His right arm, hits the backboard,
          sends it swinging. The girls toss him toward it.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

          The sun has set. There's a half moon, giving us just enough
          light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft.
          Mathias's SCREAMS echo up toward them.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - NIGHT
          Mathias has fallen silent. He lies on the backboard, eyes
          clenched, sweat beading his forehead.
          Stacy is trying not to cry. She watches Amy buckle the two
          belts together, then drape them over Mathias's chest, knot
          them tight. Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy
          to do the same. She buckles these together, too.

          STACY
          I have to pee.
          She limps toward the wall, lowers her pants, gingerly
          crouches. She stares toward the other shaft as she pees:
          its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling
          softly in the steady draught.
          Amy binds Mathias at his thighs. She WHISPERS to him:

          AMY
          You okay?
          She waits, but he doesn't respond. His eyes remain shut.
          Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back toward Amy.
          She's on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them
          off. Amy lifts her head, SHOUTS up to Jeff:
          AMY (cont'd)
          Pull him up!

          

          

          

          

          70.
          A moment's pause, then the windlass begins to CREAK once
          more. The backboard slowly rises, swaying gently. They
          watch it climb away from them. Amy holds out her-hand.
          ANY (cont'd)
          Here.
          Stacy just stares at her, not understanding. Amy nods at the
          lamp: the oil is gone.
          AMY (cont'd)
          It's gonna go out.
          And it's true: as Stacy reaches for Amy's hand, the light
          suddenly flickers, dims, drops them into darkness.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - NIGHT

          The Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite. Three
          of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing, facing the
          hillside, their backs to the fire. The young Mayan's corpse
          still lies in the dirt, fifteen feet in front of them. The
          firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT'

          The windlass CREAKS loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in
          the rope. Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole.
          She's sitting beside Mathias, who's lying on the backboard,
          on the edge of the clearing, by the orange tent.
          Amy emerges from the shaft, dangling beneath the sawhorse.
          Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole, pulls
          Amy toward him. Stacy watches from beside the backboard.
          Mathias's eyes are shut, his breathing ROUGH with phlegm.
          No one speaks. Once Amy is free of the sling, they all move
          to the backboard. Eric takes Stacy's-hand; Jeff crouches,
          starts to undo the belts.

          ERIC
          Shouldn't we carry him into the
          tent first?
          Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one.

          JEFF
          We can't.

          ERIC
          Because?

          

          

          

          

          71.

          JEFF
          He's gonna keep leaking urine.

          AMY
          But we can't just leave him out in
          the open.

          JEFF
          We'll rig a shelter. With what's
          left of the blue tent.
          Jeff pulls the second belt free. Mathias's eyes remain shut.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          One of us should stay on watch
          while the others sleep. Two hour
          shifts.
          He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it. He pulls out a liter
          bottle of water.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          .Once it's light, we'll figure out
          how much water we have, and how to
          ration it. Food, too. For now, I
          think we should each just take a
          single swig.
          He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy. He watches her drink
          from it. When she's done, she passes it to Stacy.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Eric and I'll build the shelter,.
          then I'll take the first shift.
          You two should try to sleep.
          Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle to Eric.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

          Stacy and Amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile
          along the tent's rear wall. Stacy pulls off her pants, bends
          to examine her wound in the darkness. Amy is beside her,
          lying on her side. A beat of silence. Then, WHISPERING:

          STACY
          Amy?
          what?

          

          

          

          

          72.

          STACY
          We shouldn't have lifted him,
          should we?
          Amy reaches, pats Stacy's hand.

          AMY
          Shh.

          STACY
          He's never gonna walk again.. He's--

          AMY
          Don't, Stacy. Don't talk. It'll
          only make things worse.
          Stacy falls silent.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Just go to sleep, okay? Let's try
          to go to sleep.
          Stacy lies down next to Amy, in her-underwear and T-shirt.
          They huddle close together in the darkness.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

          Eric is building a tiny lean-to for Mathias, using the duct
          tape, the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent. Jeff
          crouches over the backboard. He starts to cut Mathias's
          jeans off him with the knife. Mathias's eyes remain shut.

          ERIC
          What're you doing?

          JEFF
          We have to keep him clean.
          He slices the jeans, from ankle to hip, first one leg, then
          the other, struggling not to jostle Mathias's body.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          That's how it'll happen, I think.
          if it does.

          ERIC
          If what does?
          Jeff slides the soiled strips of-denim out from under
          Mathias's body, tosses them aside. He LOWERS his voice:.

          

          

          

          

          73.

          JEFF
          If he dies here. infection. Blood
          poisoning--something like that.
          Eric seems startled by this.

          ERIC
          You think he's gonna die?

          JEFF
          (he shrugs)
          His back is broken. Who knows what
          else.
          Eric is silent, motionless, the tape in his hand. Mathias's
          BREATHING seems to be getting steadily worse. Jeff bends to
          cut off his boxers, first one leg, then the other. He tosses
          the soiled fabric aside.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We should go back down in the
          morning.

          ERIC
          Down?

          JEFF
          Into the shaft. Try to find the
          phone again.

          ERIC
          There's no oil for the lamp.
          Jeff waves toward the orange tent.

          JEFF
          There's tequila. We could pour it
          on some of the clothes, tie them
          around one of these poles, make a
          torch.
          A sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of
          nylon and aluminum poles. Jeff steps over to pick it up.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Without the phone, he's dead. If
          we have to wait for someone to come
          searching...
          He shakes his head. Then he leans forward and carefully
          drapes the sleeping bag across Mathias's broken body.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAWN

          The orange nylon is just starting to glow with the sun's
          arrival. Stacy and Eric lie beneath one of the sleeping
          bags, Eric's head on her shoulder. Jeff lies curled on his
          side, a few feet away, still shirtless.
          Jeff's eyes open. He sits up, stares about, then reaches for
          one of the backpacks. He quietly digs through it till he
          finds a T-shirt. He sniffs at it, then pulls it on.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAWN

          Mathias lies on his backboard, eyes shut, his breathing still
          sounding THICK WITH PHLEGM. Amy sits beside him, hunched
          into herself, half drowsing. She lifts her head as Jeff
          emerges from the tent, stares at him.

          JEFF
          How is he?

           AMY
          The same.

          JEFF
          And you?

          AMY
          (she shrugs)
          Tired. Thirsty. Hungry.

          JEFF
          Once the others are up, we'll have
          some water.
          His face is stubbled, sweat-stained. He looks ragged; they
          both do. He steps to the opposite side of the clearing,
          unzips, begins to urinate, with his back to Amy.

          JEFF'S POV - ACROSS THE HILLTOP
          The vine covers everything, tangled and matted, with those
          odd, knoll-like growths scattered among it. The nearest-is
          thirty feet away. its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint
          breeze, and WE SEE a flash of yellowish white beneath them.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff finishes, shakes, zips, then steps out into the vine,
          wading toward the tiny mound. Amy remains beside the
          backboard; she watches him crouch, part the tendrils, stare.

          ANY
          What is it?
          Jeff gestures for her to approach. When she reaches him, he
          leans forward, pulls aside the vines. WE SEE a man's skull,
          a loose tumble of bones. Amy INHALES sharply, recoiling.

          JEFF
          Bodies. All of them.
          He waves across the hilltop, at the other mounds: there are
          more than a dozen. Amy takes them in. The light is gaining
          strength, the green leaves seeming to shine in it, the red
          flowers to glow. Jeff's face assumes a puzzled expression.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Where are the birds?

          AMY
          Birds?

          JEFF
          it's dawn--there should be birds.
          They both stare off across the hillside: so quiet, so still.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Stacy opens her eyes. She lies there, struggling to orient
          herself, with Eric on her shoulder. She starts to roll onto
          her side, then stops, looking confused.
          She reaches under the sleeping bag, toward her leg, her
          confusion changing to alarm. She site up, jarring Eric
          awake, and throws back the sleeping bag.

          ERIC

          (BEFUDDLED)
          What...?
          The vine has grown dramatically during the night, reaching
          out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to
          spread across Stacy's right leg, almost to her waist. She
          sits up, tries to push it off her.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          STACY
          Oh my god...
          The vine is clinging to her; she has to tear it, the sap
          shining slickly on her hands, visibly beginning to burn the
          skin. She yanks at the tendrils, tossing them aside.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Help me.
          Eric sits up, still only half-awake. He just stares.
          STACY (cont'd).
          It's inside me...
          It's true: one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the
          wound on her leg, widening it, thrusting itself a full three
          inches into her body, like a thick finger.
          STACY (cont.'d)
          Oh, Jesus--it's fucking inside me.
          She tries to pull the tendril out, but she's too panicky, too
          quick, and the vine breaks, leaving a piece of itself snagged
          under her skin. Stacy starts to SCREAM:
          STACY (cont'd)
          Get the knifes
          Eric is too shocked to stir. He's staring down at her leg,
          at the bulge beneath her skin: it looks as if it's moving.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Stacy's SCREAMING continues. Jeff and Amy are on their feet,
          hurrying across the clearing. Mathias has opened his eyes.

          STACY (O.S.)
          Get the knife!
          Jeff bends, scoops up the knife, starts toward the tent. He
          waves toward Mathias.

          JEFF
          Stay with him.
          Then he ducks in through the tent's flap.

          

          

          

          

          77.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Eric is beside Stacy, trying to calm her; she's started to
          CRY. Her hands and wrists have turned a dark red, and the
          tendril is inside her leg, just to the left of her shin,
          running parallel to it. Jeff steps. toward them.

          JEFF
          What is it?

          ERIC
          The vine. It's inside her.
          Stacy points to her wound, SOBBING now:

          STACY
          Cut it out. You gotta cut it out.

          JEFF
          The blade's dirty. We should--
          Stacy starts shaking her head, FRANTIC:

          STACY
          It's moving! Can't you see?
          Jeff stares at the bulge, hesitating. Then it moves,
          unquestionably: contracting and expanding, like a worm.
          Stacy SHRIEKS:
          STACY (cont'd)
          Jeff!
          Be gives in, crouching over her leg.

          JEFF
          It's gonna hurt.

          STACY
          Please. Hurry.
          He leans forward, slices into the skin above the bulge.
          Stacy CRIES OUT, starts to jerk away, but Jeff presses down
          on her leg, holding her still. He reaches into her wound
          with his finger, digs out the piece of vine, tosses it aside.

          JEFF
          Get me a shirt or something.
          He gestures toward the backpacks, and Eric unzips one of
          them, starts to dig through it.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          He pulls out a T-shirt, hands it to Jeff. Jeff wads it up,
          uses it to put pressure on the incision, staunching the flow
          of blood.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy is crouched by the backboard, watching the tent, trying
          to grasp what's happening. Mathias startles her by speaking:

          MATHIAS
          Something's... wrong...
          His voice is thick-sounding, very faint. Amy tries to soothe
          him; she puts her hand on his shoulder.

          AMY
          It's okay. It's just--

          MATHIAS
          my-legs...

          AMY
          I know. You're hurt. But we're.,
          gonna get you--

          MATHIAS
          Show ...me...
          He's struggling to rise, straining upward. Amy tries to stop
          him, pressing down on his shoulder.

          AMY
          Shh.
          But he fights her; he won't be quieted:

          MATHIAS.
          Show-me...
          So she leans, lifts the sleeping bag off him. His lower legs
          are completely covered by the flowering vine, from the knees
          down. Amy and Mathias both stare in surprise. Then Amy
          reaches, starts to yank the tendrils free.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Jeff is leaning forward, pressing the balled-up T-shirt
          against Stacy's wound, the blood darkening the fabric. Stacy
          is lying there, her eyes shut, fists clenched.

          STACY
          I can still feel it.

          

          

          

          

          79.
          Jeff shakes his head.

          JEFF
          I got it out.

          STACY
          I can feel it moving.

          JEFF
          That's just your body. Your muscle
          twitching.

          STACY

          BUTÂ

          ERIC
          It's on our clothes.
          Stacy and Jeff both glance at him. There's a faint, almost
          fungus-like green growing on his shirt, an infantile version
          of the vine covering the hillside all around them. It's on
          all of them: their shirts, their pants, their shoes.
          Before any of them can respond to this development, Amy
          starts to CALL from the clearing, sounding SCARED:

          AMY (O.S.)
          Jeff...?
          They all turn toward the flap. Mathias begins to SCREAM.
          Amy's voice JUMPS in volume:
           AMY (O.S.) (cont'd)
          of .I
          Jeff rises, moves toward the flap.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy is crouched over Mathias, frantically yanking the vines
          off him. Mathias is struggling impotently to sit up. He
          continues to SCREAM, staring down at his legs.
          Jeff emerges-from the tent, hurries to help Amy, both of them
          tearing at the vine, a flash of white appearing beneath the
          green, shiny and bright: bones. Mathias's legs have been
          stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down.
          As they keep pulling the tendrils free, blood starts to drip
          from Mathias's knees, slowly at first, but then suddenly
          spurting, spraying them: their chests, their faces. Amy
          jerks backward, GAGGING, RETCHING.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          She jumps up, takes three steps into the center of the
          clearing, and VOMITS, her hands on her knees. She wipes at
          the blood on her face, COUGHS, spits, then bends again,
          another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her.
          Mathias continues to SCREAM and thrash. Jeff reaches for the
          belts, lying in the dirt beside the backboard. He quickly
          ties first one then another around Mathias's legs, twisting
          them into tourniquets, cutting off the flow of blood.
          Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tent's flap: they stand
          there staring, struggling to grasp what's happened. Stacy is
          in her underwear and T-shirt, blood still seeping down her
          leg. Amy turns to face them.
          Mathias is WEEPING now, his eyes shut. The hemorrhaging has
          stopped; blood lies in puddles across the backboard. Jeff is
          covered with it. And then there are the bones: so white, so
          wet-looking, from the knees down, nothing but bone.
          Suddenly, Stacy starts to SCREAM, pointing past Amy, at the
          dirt beyond her. They all turn to look.
          The vine is in motion, a long tendril slipping into the
          clearing, moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at
          Amy's feet. Amy backs quickly away.
          A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around
          the clearing, then a third. They move rapidly, as if racing
          each other; both of them slipping alongside the first into
          the little pool of vomit.
          The tendrils absorb the puke, draining it, until all that's
          left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil. Then they withdraw
          back across the clearing, silently retreating into the larger
          mass of green. Stacy keeps SCREAMING.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          Faintly, from up the hill, WE HEAR Stacy's screams. The
          Mayans are finishing their morning meal. They eat in
          silence, showing no reaction to the sound. In the clearing,
          the young Mayan's corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of
          vine.

          EXT.. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          The four of them are sitting by the orange tent. Jeff and
          Amy are still spattered and smeared with Mathias's blood;
          Stacy is still in her underwear.

          

          

          

          

          81.
          e.-
          Jeff is inventorying their food and water. The others watch
          as he puts the perishables in a separate pile: two bananas,
          a plastic bag ofgrapes going brown, an orange, a soggy tuna
          fish sandwich.

          JEFF
          They must've dug it up.

          ANY
          Who?
          He arranges the rest of the food in a second pile: a bag of
          pretzels, a can of nuts, two protein bars, a box of raisins.

          JEFF
          The miners.
          He puts the liquids in a third pile: three bottles of water,
          two of iced tea, a can of Coke. That's all there is.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          And then the Mayans cleared the
          jungle around the hill, I guess.
          To keep it quarantined. That's why
          they won't let us leave, don't you
          think? They're afraid we'll spread
          it?
          The others are silent. Jeff reaches for the tuna fish
          sandwich. He carefully unwraps it.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Or else...I don't know. Maybe it's
          something religious? And we're
          some sort of sacrifice?
          He glances at the others, but once again no one responds.
          They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves. Jeff
          picks up the knife, wipes it on his jeans.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          They must've done the same thing
          with the archaeologists. And
          Henrich. Trapped them here. Like
          us.
          He cuts the sandwich into four equal sections.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          And then somehow it killed them
          off. All of them. one by one.
          This is too much for Eric; he.leaps up, looking panicky.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          J011

          ERIC
          We have to find the phone. We have
          to go back down and--
          Jeff makes a calming motion.

          JEFF
          We'll eat first. Drink some water.
          We have to stay calm. Not rush at
          things.
          He holds out one of the tiny squares of sandwich. Eric
          hesitates, then accepts it, dropping back into a crouch.
          Jeff hands Amy her square.

          AMY
          What about Mathias?
          She nods toward him, and they all turn to look. From his
          knees down, Mathias's legs are nothing but bone, tendon, and
          ropy clots of blackened blood. His face looks gray. His
          eyes are shut, and his breathing sounds terribly RAGGED.

          JEFF
          He wouldn't be able to stomach it.
          Jeff offers Stacy her ration. She takes it, but almost
          absentmindedly. She seems distracted; she keeps prodding at
          her wound with her fingertip.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Stop it, Stacy.

          STACY
          It's still in there. I can feel
          it.
          She keeps probing. Jeff shakes his head, a little it' ATIENT:

          JEFF
          I told you. I got it out.
          Jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth; Eric and Amy
          eat theirs, too. Stacy's ration remains in her hand; she
          seems to have forgotten it. She's sunburned, sweat-stained,
          glassy-eyed. Eric leans toward her, looking worried.

          ERIC
          Eat, Stacy. You have to eat.
          She places the tiny sandwich into her mouth, chews, swallows,
          staring at her wound the whole time. Then:

          

          

          

          

          83.

          STACY
          See? How puffy it is?

          ERIC
          That's just swelling. It's
          natural.
          (he turns toward Jeff)
          Right?

          JEFF
          (he nods)
          It's what happens when you get
          hurt.
          Jeff picks up one of the water bottles, twists off its-cap.
          He offers the bottle to Stacy.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          one swallow apiece.
          The bottle makes its way around their little circle. When it
          returns to Jeff, he takes his sip, caps the bottle. Eric is
          watching Stacy, her anxious probing; he looks increasingly
          distressed by it. He jumps up again.

          ERIC
          The phone. Let's find the phone.
          Jeff doesn't move. Stacy's bloodied khakis. are lying in the
          dirt beside him, and he reaches for them, starts to cut off
          their legs with the knife, just above the knee.

          JEFF
          We need to take care of Mathias,
          first. He won't last much longer
          like that.
          Amy looks appalled; she makes a shushing motion.

          ANY
          Shh.
          They all glance toward Mathias again. He lies there, eyes
          shut, breathing in and out with that fluid-filled RASP. He
          seems to be unconscious, but Jeff still LOWERS his voice:

          JEFF
          We have to cut them off.

          ERIC
          Cut what off?

          

          

          

          

          84.

          JEFF
          His legs.
          He's finished with Stacy's khakis; they've been transformed
          into a pair of shorts. He tosses them toward her. Eric and
          Amy are staring at him, shocked into silence. Then:

          ERIC
          You're joking.

          JEFF
          He'll die if we don't.

          AMY
          Without anaesthesia?

          JEFF
          There won't be any pain. He has no
          feeling beneath his waist.

          ERIC
          He'll lose too much blood.

          JEFF
          The tourniquets are already in
          place. We'll cut below them.

          ERIC
          With what?
          Jeff holds up the knife. Eric SCOFFS at the idea:
          ERIC (cont'd)
          That wouldn't do a thing. You'd
          need a bone saw.

          JEFF
          We could break the bones. Then
          cut.
          Amy is shaking her head; she looks mortified.

          AMY
          No, Jeff. No way.

          ERIC
          What about infection? Cutting into
          him with a dirty knife?

          JEFF
          We'll sterilize it. Build a fire.
          Heat the blade in the flames.
          It'll cauterize as it cuts.

          

          

          

          

          85.

          A 

          AMY
          You'll kill him.

          JEFF
          Or save him. One or the other. We
          can't just--

          STACY
          Cut me first. Right here.
          Stacy has stood up, pulled on the shorts Jeff has fashioned
          for her. She's bent over, pointing at a spot on her leg, a
          few inches below the last incision.
          STACY (cent'd)
          Sterilize the knife and--
          Eric steps toward her, tries to soothe her.

          ERIC
          There's nothing there, Stacy. It's

          JUST--
          She hardly seems to hear him. She's frightened, growing a
          little wild with it. Her voice comes FAST AND HIGH:

          STACY
          It's moving. I can feel it moving.

          ERIC
          You're imagining it. You're
          scared, and you--

          STACY
          I gotta get out of here. I gotta
          get to a hospital. I gotta--
          Eric takes her hand, squeezing it. Stacy blinks at him,
          close to tears.

          ERIC
          You have to calm down. Can you do
          that? Can you try to calm down?
          Stacy pulls free of him, drops into a crouch, hugging her
          knees to her chest, her eyes shut.

          STACY
          See if there's a signal.

          ERIC
          A what?

          

          

          

          

          86.

          STACY
          Your phone. Check your phone.
          Eric doesn't move: he knows there's no point.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Check it.
          Eric SIGHS, steps to his pack, crouches to remove his phone.
          He flips it open, holds it out to Stacy. She stares down at
          it: there's no signal. Eric drops it back into his pack.
          Then he turns to Jeff.

          ERIC
          We go back down. We find the other
          phone. We call for help. That's
          how we get out of here. That's how
          we save him.

          JEFF
          It'11 take too long.

          ERIC
          One call, Jeff. They'll be here by
          sundown.

          JEFF
          And Mathias will already be dying.
          You understand? There's no flesh
          covering his bones. They're--
          Mathias's voice interrupts him, from the backboard. Very
          HOARSE, barely audible:

          MATHIAS
          Do...it...
          They all turn, stare toward him. His eyes are open.
          MATHIAS (cont'd)
          Please...
          (a beat)
          Cut... them... off...
          He slowly, painfully, extends his left hand toward them, a
          beseeching gesture.

          CU - SMALL PILE OF CLOTHES
          A pair of shorts, a woman's blouse, two black socks.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          I'll have to break the bones first.
          An amber liquid is being poured onto the clothes, very
          slowly. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Eric is crouched, dribbling the tequila onto the clothes,
          pausing to let it soak in, saturating the fabric. Jeff is
          kneeling by the backboard, talking to Mathias.

          JEFF
          With the stone. Then I'll use the
          knife to cut.
          A large stone sits beside the pile of clothes, shaped like an
          ax head. There's the knife, too, and the metal canteen from
          the orange tent.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We'll heat the canteen, and
          cauterize the wounds with it. To
          stop the bleeding.
          Eric strikes a match: the clothes catch instantly, burning
          with a low blue flame. He sets the knife in the fire, then
          the stone, and splashes more tequila on them. The girls
          stand in the center of the clearing, watching.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You shouldn't be able to feel a
          thing. But you can bite this if
          you want. Just in case.
          He holds up one of the belts. Mathias hesitates, then opens
          his mouth, and Jeff sets it carefully inside. Mathias clamps
          down, gripping it between his teeth. Jeff glances at Eric.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Ready?
          Eric nods.- The stone is making a cracking sound in the fire,
          glowing a.deep red. Jeff turns back to Mathias.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You?
          Mathias also nods, shutting his eyes. There's a small towel
          in the dirt beside Jeff, and he. picks it up, wrapping it
          around his hand. He looks over his shoulder at the girls.
          They both seem terrified, shaky with it.

          

          

          

          

          88.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You should wait in the tent.
          Amy starts to shake her head, but then Stacy is in motion,
          grabbing her hand, pulling her across the clearing, and she
          lets herself be led.
          Jeff watches them vanish through the flap, then reaches
          toward the fire with his towel-swathed hand. He scoops up
          the stone, raises it over his head, SLAMS it down with all
          his strength against the exposed bones of Mathias's left leg.
          Mathias bucks, GROANING; his eyes jump open. Jeff drops the
          stone back into the fire,. snatches out the knife. Mathias is
          trying to rise onto his elbow, straining to see what's
          happening.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Hold him.
          Eric sets the canteen into the flames, sloshes some tequila
          on it, then shifts.to the backboard. He presses down on
          Mathias''s shoulders. Mathias is WHIMPERING, twisting his
          head back and forth, gripping the belt tightly in his teeth.
          Jeff starts to saw with the knife, chopping and cutting the
          splintered bones. Bloody marrow spills wetly out, and then
          Mathias's.lower leg comes free of his body, the foot and
          ankle and shin bones completely separate now.
          Jeff lifts the bones away, drops them into the dirt beside
          the backboard. Then he turns, uses the towel to pluck the
          canteen out of the fire: it, too, is glowing red.
          He presses the canteen flat against Mathias's stump, the
          flesh SIZZLING and SPITTING. Mathias bucks even more
          forcefully; he spits out the belt, CRIES OUT:

          MATHIAS
          Stop...stop...
          Jeff ignores him, dropping the canteen back into the fire,
          lifting out the stone. Eric looks increasingly mortified; he
          seems close to tears.

          ERIC

          JEFF--

          JEFF
          Reep him still.
          He turns, SMASHES the stone into Mathias's right leg.
          Mathias begins to SCREAM, bucking against Eric's grip.

          

          

          

          

          89.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Mathias's SCREAMS fill the tent. Amy and Stacy are sitting
          together, clutching each other; Stacy is CRYING. Amy is
          staring toward the flap with a look of horror.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Jeff saws and chops at the shattered bones with the knife.
          Mathias continues'to SCREAM. Eric is using all his weight to
          hold him still, his head averted, his eyes clenched shut.
          Jeff lifts the severed bones.away from the backboard, drops
          them at his side. Then he scoops up the canteen again. As
          he presses it to Mathias's stump, Mathias finally passes out,
          his body going slack, his screams falling SILENT.
          For a long beat, there's just the SPITTING, SNAPPING sound of
          Mathias's flesh being seared. Then Eric pulls back into a
          crouch, shaking his head, looking utterly depleted.

          ERIC
          Oh, Jesus. Jesus Christ.
          Amy emerges from the tent, then Stacy. They stand staring.

          AMY
          He felt it, didn't he? The whole
          thing.
          Jeff lifts the canteen away.

          JEFF
          He couldn't have.

          AMY
          He was screaming. Be was telling
          you to stop.

          JEPF
          It was just seeing it. Looking
          down, and--
          Amy is shaking her head, staring at Mathias with that
          appalled expression: his slack face, his burned stumps.

          AMY
          This is bad, Jeff. So bad.
          Jeff leans to loosen first one tourniquet, then the other.

          

          

          

          

          90.

          JEFF
          We've bought him some time. He
          wouldn't have--

          AMY
          You cut off his legs! You--
          Stacy SCREAMS, pointing toward Mathias's amputated limbs.
          They're lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard, the
          bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cords
          of flesh. A vine has come snaking into the clearing: it's
          wrapping itself around one of the feet.
          As the tendril begins to drag. the bones away, a.second one
          slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot.
          Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first tendril,
          bends to slash at it with the blade. He swoops toward the
          second one. Even as he does so, though, a third tendril
          slithers into the clearing, then a fourth.
          Stacy SCREAMS again, short and loud, and backs toward the
          tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and the'vine
          keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones.

          JEFF
          Leave it.
          Eric ignores him, cutting and stomping and tearing at the
          tendrils, faster and faster, but still too slow, the vine
          fighting back, wrapping itself around his legs.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Eric.
          He steps toward him, grabs his arm, pulls him away. They
          stand side by side, watching as the vine pulls the severed
          limbs into itself, the white of the bones vanishing into the
          larger mass of green. Stacy has begun to CRY again.
          There's a beat of stillness, and then, once more, echoing up
          toward them from the shaft, comes that faint electronic
          RINGING of the cell phone.

          CU - THE WINDLASS
          Spinning, the rope spooling quickly off the barrel.

          JEFF (O.S.)
          I don't know how long it'11 burn--

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

          

          

          

          

          91.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Eric is pulling the rope off the windlass, laying it out in a
          long zigzag across the clearing. Jeff is crouched by the
          shaft, making a torch. The girls stand over him, watching.

          JEFF
          So you'll have to be quick.
          He has one of the aluminum poles from the blue tent. He's
          wrapped duct tape around its bottom for a grip, tied some of
          the archaeologists' clothes around the top. He's dribbling
          tequila on the knot of fabric, saturating it.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Wait to light it till you're both
          down there. Then--

          STACY
          Who?
          Jeff looks up at her, startled by the question. Eric is
          moving along the length of rope, bent low, checking its hemp
          for signs of weakness.

          JEFF
          Who what?

          STACY
          Who's going?

          JEFF
          You and Amy.
          They all look bad, but Stacy looks the worst: her wounded
          leg,, -her greasy hair, a panicky edge to every gesture. She
          shakes her head, with vehemence.

          STACY
          No, Jeff. No way. Not me.
          Jeff caps the tequila bottle, gives Stacy a tired look.

          JEFF
          We've already been through this.
          Eric and I need to work the winch.
          You're not strong enough.
          Eric has reached the end of the rope; he stands up, wiping
          his hands on his pants.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          ERIC
          It's clear.
          He moves to the windlass, starts to wind the rope back onto
          the barrel. They've tied a sling on the rope's end again.
          Stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of her
          rib cage: massaging, probing

          STACY
          Why can't Amy go on her own?

          JEFF
          The torch won't last that long. We
          need you both there, searching.
          Stacy starts shaking her head again, TERRIFIED:

          STACY
          I'm not going. I can't.

          JEFF
          You don't have a choice, Stacy.
          Amy can see where this is headed; she tries to divert it.

          AMY
          It's okay. I'll go alone.
          Jeff ignores this. He rises to his feet, still focused on
          Stacy. WE can HEAR his growing anger in his voice:

          JEFF
          if we don't find the phone, Mathias
          will die. Understand?
          Stacy is silent, hugging herself, staring at the ground.
          Eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass. He
          tries to intervene:

          ERIC

          JEFF--
          Jeff ignores him, his gaze on Stacy.

          JEFF
          So that's what you're saying. Just
          to be clear. That you're not
          willing to help him live.

          ERIC
          Come on, man. She's too scared.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          JEFF
          I don't give a fuck. I'm scared,
          too. We all are.

          ERIC
          it was inside her.

          JEFF
          And we got it out. Now she needs
          to stop being such a fucking baby,
          stop being so selfish, and--
          Eric is stepping toward him suddenly, right up against him,
          forcing him back a step.

          ERIC
          ,hut Up. Okay?
          He's bigger than Jeff, stronger, and this is suddenly very
          palpable. Their faces are three inches apart. A tense beat,
          and then, more QUIETLY:
          ERIC (cont'd)
          You're being too hard.
          Jeff gives him a look of incredulity, almost disgust.

          JEFF
          Hard?

          ERIC
          Just leave her be.
          Jeff turns away from him, from all three of them. He stares
          off across the hill for a beat, then shakes his head.

          JEFF
          I'm the only one thinking. I'm
          carrying the whole fucking load.

          ERIC
          So stop. Lay it down.
          Jeff turns back to him, gives him a look of pure contempt; WE
          can HEAR his fury rising again as he speaks:

          JEFF
          This isn't just going to work out
          on its own, Eric. You know?
          Magically?

          ERIC
          I'm not saying--

          

          

          

          

          94.

          JEFF
          We could end up dead here. All of
          us. Is that what you want?

          ERIC
          Of course not.

          JEFF
          Then get the fuck out of my way,
          and start helping me.
          He holds Eric's eyes long enough to confirm that Eric isn't
          going to protest, then he glances past him at Stacy.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You going or not?
          Stacy-is still staring at the ground, her hand probing at her
          chest. It's clear she doesn't want to go, but Jeff has
          shamed her into silence. Amy reaches, touches her arm.

          AMY
          .'-11 be right there. Okay? We'll
          be together the whole time.
          A long beat, then Stacy manages a nod. It's enough for Jeff;
          he pushes past Eric, moving toward the windlass.

          JEFF
          Get in the sling, Amy.
          Amy turns, reaching for the sling.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - DAY

          A faint fall of light from above. There's the CREAKING of
          the windlass: Amy is dropping slowly toward us. When her
          feet touch the bottom of the shaft, she scrambles out of the
          sling. Then she lifts her head, SHOUTS:

          AMY
          Pull it up!
          The CREAKING resumes. She stands there in the dimness,
          watching the sling rise away from her. She has the makeshift
          torch in one hand, the box of matches in the other.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING

          Eric is helping Stacy into the sling, pulling it over her
          head; Stacy's hands are shaking badly. Eric hugs her, trying
          to calm her. Jeff waits beside the hand crank.

          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
          Amy is in a crouch. She keeps glancing toward the stone arch
          cut into the shaft's wall, and the passageway beyond it: the
          vine dangles from.the low ceiling, like streamers at a party.
          The CREAKING resumes, and Amy looks up.

          AMY'S POV - ABOVE HER
          Stacy is dropping slowly toward us.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Amy glances toward the arch again. A slight draft blows
          steadily from it, and the vine shifts and trembles in it. A
          beat, then the RINGING starts up once more. It's coming from
          within the shadowed passageway.
          Amy opens the box of matches, plucks one out. She's too
          jumpy, though; her hands are-trembling so much that she
          shakes the match out as soon as it's lit.
          There's a second RING. Stacy has nearly reached us.
          Amy digs another match from the box. Stacy's feet touch the
          bottom of the shaft; she yanks off the sling. There's a
          third RING.

          STACY
          Hurry.
          Amy strikes the match, holds it to the knot of clothing at
          the end of the aluminum pole. The alcohol catches with a
          FLUTTERING sound, a cloud of pale blue fire materializing
          around the torch. Amy lifts it, and they start into:

          THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE
          Stacy is in front, with Amy right behind her. The torch
          shudders weakly in the steady draft; the shaft's ceiling is
          low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward.
          There's a fourth RING, drawing them deeper down the passage.

          

          

          

          

          96.
          The tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them.
          The vine is growing on the floor, too--knee-deep--and from
          the walls on either side. Amy is moving cautiously,
          squinting into the darkness, and Stacy starts to pull ahead.

          AMY
          Wait...
          She pauses, lifting the torch, but Stacy keeps going. Amy
          peers at the vine hanging from the wall. There's a fifth
          RING, echoing eerily, and the flowers move in exact unison
          with the sound, their stamens vibrating, like so many
          miniature tuning forks: the plant is making the noise.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Stacy...
          The shaft dead-ends at a blank wall, which is just
          materializing out of the darkness, fifteen feet in front of
          them. There's a sixth RING. Stacy points at the wall,
          quickening her pace.

          STACY
          It's right here. I can--
          Amy jumps forward, reaching for her.

          AMY

          DON'T--
          But there's another RING, and Stacy keeps going: she's
          nearly at the wall.

          STACY

          IT'S--
          Stop!
          Amy grabs her arm, hard, jerks her back a step, pulling her
          close, the torchlight flickering over them. She WHISPERS:
          AMY (cont'd)
          There's no phone.

          STACY
          What?
          A seventh RING sounds, seeming to come from beneath the vines
          on the floor of the shaft, directly in front of them. Stacy
          tries to pull free, to bend and reach toward the sound.

          

          

          

          

          97.
          STACY (cont'd)
          I can--
          Amy jerks her back again, WHISPERS straight into her ear:

          ANY
          It's the vine. The flowers.
          They're making the noise.

          STACY
          No. It's--
          She pulls free, steps forward, and her foot seems to punch
          straight through the shaft's floor. She SCREAMS, losing her
          balances Amy throws down the torch, lunges for her. The
          torch flutters, pales, but remains lit.
          The vines growing across the floor fall away, revealing an
          opening, another shaft, dropping into the earth. Stacy is
          slowly sliding into it, scrambling to stop herself.
          Amy grabs Stacy arm. Stacy is dangling, from the waist down,
          over the hole's edge. There are vines in the hole, too, and.
          they begin to coil around her legs, pulling at her, dragging
          her downward.
          Stacy SCREAMS again, kicking to free herself, scrambling
          upward, monkey-like, while Amy pulls at her, and finally they
          manage to drag her to safety.
          A beat, then Amy retrieves the torch, holds it out over the
          hole. The bottom is twenty feet down, almost lost in shadow.
          Dimly, WE SEE a woman, lying curled against the wall--she has
          long dark hair.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Oh my God.
          The woman stirs, her body rolling, as if to turn and look at
          us, and WE SEE her face: she's a corpse. The vine has
          invaded her flesh--it's in her eye sockets, the hollow of her
          mouth, writhing and churning. Stacy and Amy SCREAM.
          There's a WHISTLING sound, like a whip, and a tendril lashes
          out from the shaft's wall, wraps itself around the torch's
          handle, yanks it from Amy's grip. The torch falls into the
          hole, still burning. When it hits bottom, a mass of vine
          surges across it, smothering its flame.
          It's very dark after this: Amy and Stacy are barely
          discernible. A beat of silence, then an odd, high-pitched
          CACKLING rises all around them; it sounds like laughter--
          eerie, childlike, full of echoes.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          As it steadily increases in volume, that WHISTLING comes once
          more: the vines SMACK at them from the floor, the ceiling,
          the walls, coiling around their bodies, pulling them toward
          the open shaft.
          They both SCREAM again, scrambling backward, while the vine
          keeps coming, more and more of it, grabbing at their arms,
          their legs, their necks. They stumble over each other,
          falling onto their hands and knees.amid the.tendrils.
          The vine catches at them, tries to hold them down. It's not
          strong enough, though; they yank it off, and thrash their
          way, foot by foot, back toward the sling, the vine lashing at
          them, grabbing, tearing, sap leaking onto their skin. The
          laughter grows still louder, the whole shaft ECHOING with it.
          Amy reaches the sling first, with Stacy right behind her.
          Even here, the vine continues to attack them, whipping and
          HISSING and LAUGHING. Amy holds the sling toward Stacy.

          AMY
          You.
          But Stacy is too hysterical: she just stands there, SOBBING,
          SCREAMING. Jeff's voice comes toward them from above,

          SHOUTING:

          JEFF (0.S.)
          Amoy...?
          Amy pulls the sling over her own head. YELLS:

          AMY
          Pull us up!

          JEFF (O.S.)
          Did you find it?

          AMY

          NMI
          She reaches out, grabs Stacy, wrapping her arms and legs
          around her. Stacy returns the embrace, both of them
          clutching at each other, as the windlass finally begins to
          CREAK, lifting the two of them into the air.

          ON AMY AND STACY - IN THE SLING
          The vines hanging from the shaft's walls whip at the girls as
          they rise, coiling around their bodies, pulling at them, that
          strange LAUGHTER growing ever louder, seeming to buffet their
          bodies. Stacy and Amy grip each other with all their
          strength, eyes shut tight. Stacy SCREAMS.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OP. THE HILL - DAY

          The SCREAM comes faintly toward us. The Mayans are arrayed
          about their campsite, all of them motionless, silent, staring
          up the hill with their impassive expressions.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK

          The weather has shifted; a wind has risen. The sun is
          setting, a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds.
          Mathias lies.on his backboard, unconscious, his breathing
          coming in that ragged RASP, a thread of brown liquid leaking
          from the corner of his mouth. Amy is crouched beside him;
          she leans forward, wipes away the liquid.
          Stacy sits in the clearing behind her, leaning against Eric.
          They're both slick with sweat, but Stacy keeps shivering, as
          if cold. Eric's arms are around her, and her eyes are shut.
          Jeff is peeling the orange. Like Amy, he's still spattered
          and stained with Mathias's blood. The vine has continued to
          grow on everyone's clothes, weblike, eating away at the
          fabric. Jeff reaches, tugs free a strand of it, and a six-
          inch tear appears in his T-shirt.
          Stacy opens her eyes; she leans forward, peers down at the
          wounds on her leg, her right hand moving to her chest,
          probing at her rib cage. She turns to Eric:

          STACY
          Check your phone.
          Eric pushes himself to his feet, steps toward his pack. He
          pulls out his phone, flips it open. He shakes his head.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Let me see.
          Eric carries the phone to her, then stands over her while she
          opens it, stares down at it. She shuts it, opens it again.
          Then again, and again, and suddenly she's CRYING, bent into
          herself. Eric drops to a crouch, rests his hand on her knee.

          ERIC
          Shh.
          But her crying increases; she begins to SOB. Jeff is bent'
          over the orange, dividing it into four equal piles--its peel,
          too--concentrating. He lifts his head, stares. Amy stands
          up, hurries over., kneels in front of Stacy, takes her hand.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          AMY
          It's okay, sweetie. You're okay.
          Stacy keeps WEEPING, uncontrollably, shaking her head.

          STACY
          I wanner go home. I wanna leave...

          ERIC
          Shh...
          She's WAILING, rocking back and forth; she can't seem to
          stop. Amy struggles to calm her.

          AMY
          Stacy...
          Stacy keeps WAILING, rocking, eyes shut. Amy leans in close.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Let's play the game...can you do
          that? Huh? Can you give me a
          "So"?
          Stacy continues to CRY.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Come on. Just try. Can you try?
          (a beat)
          So there was this girl who wanted
          to be a pilot.
          Stacy's tears keep coming. Amy looks at Eric, gives him a
          nod,'prodding him into speech. He hesitates, then:

          ERIC
          But she was scared of heights.

          AMY
          So she became a lifeguard instead.
          (she squeezes Stacy's

          HAND)
          Come on. Your turn.
          More SOBS. Amy glances across the clearing at Jeff, wanting
          him to join in, too. It seems as if he might refuse, but
          then her look hardens, and he relents.

          JEFF
          But she couldn't swim.

          

          

          

          

          101.

          AMY
          So she wore a life vest.
          (she squeezes Stacy's hand

          AGAIN)
          Come on. Now you.
          A beat, then Stacy takes a deep, ragged breath. She wipes at
          her face, struggles for words.

          STACY
          But everyone...
          She trails off, CRYING again. Amy nods, encouraging her.

          AMY
          Yeah...? Everyone what?

          STACY
          They laughed at her.

          AMY
          Good. That's good. So she--
          Very suddenly, it starts to rain--a dozen large, heavy drops.
          They all glance skyward.

          JEFF

          SHITÂ¢
          He springs to his feet. And then: a downpour, a deluge, as
          if a trap door has swung open in the clouds. The rain falls
          in a loud, drumming rush, turning the clearing to mud.
          Eric jumps up, too. He and Jeff start digging through the
          backpacks from the. blue tent, searching for something--
          anything--in which to catch the water. They find a small
          plastic bag, a nylon toiletry kit, a Frisbee. Jeff sets
          these in a row on the ground, open to the rain.
          Eric rushes to the orange tent, vanishes inside. Amy tilts
          back her head, tries to catch the rain in her open mouth.
          Stacy just sits there, hugging herself, shivering, still half-
          crying. They're all drenched, back-spattered with mud.
          And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to
          slacken. Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a
          thermos, a plastic cup. He sets them next to the other
          containers, but it's pointless; the rain is already stopping.
          They all stare at these meager receptacles: they've managed
          to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water. Jeff.
          GROANS; he's FURIOUS with himself:

          

          

          

          

          102.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We should've been ready. We

          SHOULD'VE-
          He kicks the Frisbee across the clearing. Amy jumps up.

          AMY

          JEFFT
          She steps forward, as if to guard the other containers.

          JEFF
          It doesn't fucking matter.

          AMY
          There was water in it.
          He spins toward her, turning his fury with himself on her:

          JEFF
          How much, Amy? Two and a half
          gallons? 'Cause that's what we
          need. For today--just to make it
          through today. And then tomorrow
          the same all over again. And for
          how long? Another week before our
          parents start searching? And then
          what? How long till they track us
          to Coba? Or to this fucking hill?
          How long will it take, Amy?

          AMY
          You said--

          JEFF
          It's not gonna happen. We're not
          gonna make it.
          The others stare at him in astonishment, too 'stunned to
          speak. He gives them all a look of disgust:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          And you're fucking playing games.
          (mimicking Amy's voice)
          So there were these people trapped
          in the jungle.

          AMY
          Don't, Jeff.

          JEFF
          But they didn't have any water.

          

          

          

          

          103.
          Amy looks as if she might start crying.

          AMY
          Please, don't.

          JEFF
          So they're gonna die of thirst.
          Amy covers her ears with her hands.

          AMY
          Shut up!

          JEFF
          But this fucking vine might kill
          them first.

          AMY

          (SHOUTING)

          STOP IT!
          Jeff paces away, struggling to regain control of himself. A
          long beat, and then, very QUIETLY:

          JEFF
          I'm sorry ...I'm sorry.
          He steps back toward the dismembered orange, crouches over
          it. The fruit and peels are muddy now, spoiled looking. He
          waves for the others to approach.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Come on. We need to eat.
          No one moves. They're all staring at him with their shocked
          expressions. He can't seem to meet their eyes. He gestures
          at the orange again.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          The peel, too. Everything.
          Abeat, then the others step forward to claim their portions:
          first Eric, then Stacy, then Amy. They eat without speaking.
          Finally, almost AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It'll rain again. It has to. And
          we'll figure out a way to catch it.
          (he nods to himself)
          We'll be fine. We'll ration the
          -food. And then, you know, we'll
          just...we'll tough it out..

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          104.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          People have survived for weeks with
          nothing. Just water, a little bit
          of water. So why not us?
          No one responds. They continue to eat: the fruit, the
          peels. Their torn clothes cling wetly to them. Jeff uncaps
          the water bottle, offers it to Amy. She drinks, passes it
          on. It moves around the circle, back to Jeff.

          ERIC
          What about the vine?
          Jeff takes his sip, caps the bottle. He's reclaiming
          himself, his voice strengthening, his confidence returning.

          JEFF
          I don't think it can hurt us. Not
          directly. if it could, it already
          would've, wouldn't it? Why would
          it wait?
          The others are silent, considering this. Then:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's not strong enough to overpower
          us. And it--
          Mathias GASPS suddenly, his entire body spasming for a
          moment, before the watery RASP of his breathing resumes. He
          doesn't regain consciousness; his eyes remain shut. Everyone
          watches him for a beat: he, also, is spattered with mud.

          AMY
          He's gonna die, isn't he? if
          there's no phone, then there's no--

          STACY
          Me, too.
          They all turn to look at her. She's massaging that spot on
          her rib cage again, digging into it with her fingers.
          STACY (cont'd)
          It's eating me. Just like him.
          And her.
          She waves toward the shaft. Jeff gives her a weary look.

          JEFF
          Don't, Stacy. Don't start.
          She jumps up, begins to pace, agitated.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          STACY
          It's inside me. In my leg. My
          chest. I can feel it. Right here..
          She stops pacing, lifts her shirt. She points to the base of
          her rib cage.
          STACY (cont'd)
          See?
          Jeff stares; there's nothing there. He shakes his head. The
          knife is lying in the mud beside him, and Stacy steps
          forward, snatches it up. Jeff reaches to stop her, but he's
          too slow. She stands before him, hefting it. in her hand.

          JEFF
          Put it down.

          STACY
          I'll show you.
          She lifts her.shirt again, pressing at her rib cage with her
          .fingertips. Jeff stands up, holds out his hand.

          JEFF
          Give it to me. Right now.
          Amy and Eric stand, too.

          ERIC

          STACY--
          But she's already cutting: a four inch slit along the base
          of her rib cage. Amy SCREAMS. A horizontal line of blood
          crests the wound, sweeps down across Stacy's stomach, soaking
          into the waistband of her shorts. She watches it, frowning.

          STACY
          I thought it would just come
          tumbling out.
          She probes at the cut with the point of the knife, prying it
          farther open, the bleeding increasing. Jeff reaches, grabs
          the knife from her. He looks furious:

          JEFF .
          Sit down.

          STACY
          It's hiding. It's right--
          She pokes her finger into the wound, digging. Jeff slaps her
          hand away. He YELLS:

          

          

          

          

          106.

          JEFF
          a il hï¿½ f down i
          He shoves her down, onto her back, then picks up the towel
          he'd used to hold the heated stone. He balls it up, presses
          it to Stacy's wound. Eric retrieves the bottle of tequila
          from the mud, uncaps it. He crouches beside Stacy.

          ERIC
          Don't yell. she's just scared.

          SHE'S--

          JEFF
          what're you doing?
          He's lifting the bottle toward Stacy's mouth, but he
          hesitates now, turning toward Jeff.

          ERIC
          Just a sip. To calm her.

          JEFF
          It'll dehydrate-her.

          ERIC
          A sip, Jeff.
          He starts to lift the bottle again. Jeff shoves it aside.

          JEFF
          I said Q.

          STACY
          Leave him alone.
          She tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down, hard.

          JEFF
          You realize how stupid you're
          being? Sticking that dirty knife

          INTO--

          STACY
          It's growing.

          JEFF
          of ina's.inside you. You're
          imagining it, and you just--

          STACY
          I'm gonna end up like her. That
          girl. I'm gonna--

          

          

          

          

          107.
          r -

          JEFF
          Get infected. Understand? You're
          gonna get yourself killed.

          STACY
          You're not listening.

          JEFF

          BECAUSE--

          STACY
          (shouting, very loud)

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
          A beat of startled silence, and then her voice comes again,
          from across the hilltop, sounding exactly like her, only
          slightly fuzzed, a rasping quality just beneath the words:

          STACY'S VOICE

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
          They all turn to look, but there's nothing there, just the
          vine, its green leaves, its bright red flowers. Stacy's
          voice comes once more, from the.opposite direction now:
          STACY'S VOICE (cont'd)

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!

          ERIC
          What the--
          Stacy's voice keeps coming, switching locations, seeming to
          float across the hilltop; they turn, tracking it.

          STACY'S VOICE

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE

          NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT

          LISTENING...!
          Amy steps toward Jeff, looking frightened.

          AMY
          The Mayans.

          JEFF
          (shaking his head)
          No--it's the vine. It's mimicking
          her.
          Stacy has started to CRY; she covers her ears with her hands.

          STACY
          Make it stop.

          

          

          

          

          108.

          STACY'S VOICE

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE

          NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT

          LISTENING...!

          STACY
          Please. Make it stop.

          STACY'S VOICE

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE

          NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT

          LISTENING...!
          Stacy tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down. Se's
          still crouched over her, pressing the towel to her wound;
          it's completely soaked through with blood now. Stacy YELLS:

          STACY
          Shut up...!
          Stacy's voice continues, but now that high-pitched LAUGHTER
          is coming, too, a chorus of it, growing in volume:

          STACY'S VOICE

          YOU'RE NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE

          NOT LISTENING...! YOU'RE NOT

          LISTENING...!
          Stacy's weeping has deepened to SOBS. She keeps YELLING:

          STACY
          Shut up...! Shut up...!
          The LAUGHTER grows steadily LOUDER, obscuring Stacy's voice:
          WE SEE the flowers trembling, visibly vibrating as they
          sculpt the sound...

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DUSK

          The light is fading fast. One of the Mayan women is cleaning
          a pot with a handful of leaves. Three of the men sit facing
          the hillside, their bows in their laps. The others are
          bedding down beneath the trees.
          The LAUGHTER echoes down the hill, eerie and ghoulish, yet
          the Mayans betray no reaction to it, as if it were no more
          worthy of note to them than the steady RASPING of the locusts
          in the jungle at their backs.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

          Jeff, Stacy and Amy lie side-by-side in the darkness. The
          liquid RATTLE of Mathias's breathing comes from the clearing,
          sounding as if someone were sawing at a tin can.
          Jeff and Stacy are asleep; Amy is stirring restlessly,
          shifting first onto one side, then the other. Finally, she
          rises, moves toward the flap, slips quietly through it.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

          The moon is out, dropping its faint light upon us. Mathias
          is on his backboard beneath the little lean-to, more audible
          than visible, with his PHLEGM-CLOTTED breathing. Eric is
          beside him. He looks up as Amy emerges from the tent.

          ANY
          Now is he?
          Eric shrugs, waves toward the backboard: it seems clear
          enough. Amy stares-for a moment, then sits beside him.
          AMY (cont'd)
          You can go lie down if you want.
          Eric lifts his hand, pushes a button on his watch, makes it
          glow. He squints at it.

          ERIC
          I still have forty minutes.

          AMY
          I don't mind. I can't sleep.
          Eric checks his watch again, its glow briefly illuminating
          his face. He gestures toward the tent.

          ERIC
          Is Stacy?

          AMY
          They both are.
          There's a slight breeze, and the tent makes a FLAPPING SOUND
          in it. They both turn to stare at it. Then:
          AMY (cont'd)
          Do you think it's inside her?

          

          

          

          

          110.

          ERIC
          (he shakes his head)
          Jeff cut it out. I saw him.

          AMY
          But she says she can feel it.
          Moving. Shifting about.
          Eric waves this aside.

          ERIC
          You know how Stacy is. She's just
          scared. She gets things in her
          head, and---
          Mathias makes a RETCHING sound--loud, wet, painful--and they
          both turn,â¢peering at his gaunt form through the darkness.
          He falls QUIET; his eyes don't open. A beat, then:
          ERIC (cont'd)
          I've been sitting here, you know,
          making all these deals in my head
          with God. You ever do that?
          Amy just stares at him. He has his arms wrapped around his
          knees, hugging them to his chest.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          Like I say, okay, you can fire me
          on the first day teaching if that's
          what you want--just let us make it
          home. But that doesn't mean shit,
          'cause I don't even really want the
          job, and He has to know that,
          doesn't He? So I say, all right,
          Stacy can leave me, you know, or
          even, I don't know, I'll give up a
          finger, okay? Or two fingers. Or
          fuck it, take a hand, take my left
          hand, but let us just get home, all
          of us.
          (a beat)
          And then I look at him--
          (he nods toward Mathias)
          --and I can't help it, I'm, like,
          take him if you need to, take
          Mathias, and let the rest of us go.
          That's fucking horrible, isn't it?
          And once I've said it, I feel like
          I can't take it back, you know?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          
          ERIC (cont'd)
          Like the words have gone up into
          the sky and God's sort of thinking
          about them now, making his choice,
          and if Mathias dies and we don't,
          it'll be.like I killed him, won't
          it? Like I--
          Amy starts to CRY; she covers her mouth with her hand. Eric
          stares at her in surprise.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          What? What is it?
          Amy shakes her head. She struggles to stop, but she can't.

          AMY
          I'm sorry ...I'm so sorry...
          (a beat)
          It's my fault.

          ERIC
          what is?

          AMY
          If I hadn't stepped onto the hill--
          Her crying INCREASES. Eric leans, touches her hand.

          ERIC
          That's stupid, Amy. That's--

          AMY
          Jeff said it. He said--
          Eric reaches, puts his arm around her, trying to quiet her.

          ERIC
          He didn't mean it. There's no way.
          He was just--

          AMY
          We might not have...

          ERIC
          Shh. Don't.
          She rests her head on his shoulder, WEEPING, her body shaking
          with it, while he pats her, stroking her hair.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - NIGHT

          Stacy and Jeff, eyes shut, sleeping. Very SOFTLY, there
          comes a faint PANTING, rhythmic, furtive sounding. Stacy's
          eyes open; she lies there, listening.
          There's a MOAN, and the PANTING QUICKENS. Stacy rises to a
          sitting position. She listens for another beat, then leans,
          prods at Jeff. He awakes with a jerk, blinking up at her.

          JEFF
          Wh--?
          Stacy holds her finger to her lips, silencing him.. From
          outside, there's another MOAN. Jeff sits up, listening. The
          PANTING is BUILDING toward a climax. Jeff leans toward the
          pile of supplies at the tent's rear, squinting at the tangle
          of vine growing across it. He points, WHISPERING:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's the--
          But Stacy is already pushing herself to her feet. She moves
          quickly to the tent's flap, UNZIPS it, crouches out into:

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - NIGHT

          Mathias's breathing continues its RAGGED course. Amy is
          still leaning into Eric, her head on his shoulder. He has
          his arm around her. He looks up, blinking, as Stacy emerges
          from the tent into the moonlight.

          . STACY
          What the fuck, Eric?
          Amy lifts her head, wipes at her face; Eric drops his arm
          from her shoulder. They both stare at Stacy, startled by her
          anger. Jeff appears behind her, stepping through the flap.

          ERIC
          What?

          STACY
          We heard you.

          ERIC
          Heard me what?

          STACY
          Fucking her.

          

          

          

          

          113.
          Eric looks from Stacy to Jeff, completely perplexed.

          ERIC
          What're you talking about?

          JEFF
          The vine. it made it sound as if
          you two--
          Stacy turns toward him, SNORTING, shaking her head.

          STACY
          You're so blind.

          JEFF
          I could hear it. At the back of
          the tent. It was--

          STACY
          It doesn't make things up. It
          mimics things. Things it's heard.

          JEFF
          Then it's heard someone having sex
          at some point.
          Slowly, quietly, a tendril has begun to slither forward
          through the darkness, creeping in beneath the lean-to,
          snaking toward Mathias, toward his head. Jeff and the others
          are all too focused on one another to notice.

          STACY
          That was Ay, Jeff. Moaning.

          AMY
          What?
          Jeff reaches, touches Stacy's arm, struggling to calm her,
          but she flinches from him.

          JEFF
          it's doing this on purpose.' Can't
          you see? It thinks you're the
          weakest--because you're hurt. So
          it's trying to upset you. Trying

          TO--

          STACY
          You're not upset? He had his arm
          around her. He--
          Amy leans forward, hands out, BESEECHING:

          

          

          

          

          114.

          AMY
          Nothing happened, Stacy. I was
          crying. And Eric--

          STACY
          We he-ar you.
          The vine starts to push its way in between Mathias's lips,
          into his mouth. Mathias makes a GAGGING sound, but doesn't
          regain consciousness: once more, no one notices.

          JEFF
          We heard the vine. It--

          STACY
          You're such a fool, Jeff. You
          think she's never cheated on you?
          Perfect little angelic Amy?

          AMY
          Stacy.

          STACY
          I could tell you secrets. I could
          open your eyes.

          AMY
          Shi i up. Right now.
          A second tendril has slithered under the lean-to. It covers
          Mathias's nose, drawing itself tight. The steady rasping of
          his breathing is CUT OFF. Yet again, no one notices.

          STACY
          Spring break? Senior year?

          AMY
          You bitch. You stupid cunt.
          Stacy spins on her, VENOMOUS:

          STACY
          Fuck you. Slut.
          (back to Jeff)
          Twice, Jeff. Two different guys.
          And one of them--
          Jeff grabs her arm, grips it, silencing hers

          JEFF
          Enough, Stacy. Stoll.

          

          

          

          

          115.
          Stacy falls SILENT; she seems as astonished by what she's
          said as everyone else.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Where do you think you are? Huh?
          Why would you even care--at this
          point, if they were out here
          fucking? We're trapped. We don't
          have any food. Or water. And

          MATHIAS--
          He turns, stares: sees. He darts forward, starts to yank
          away the tendrils. They resist him, writhing, clinging to
          Mathias's face. Eric and Amy both jump up. Stacy has
          started to CRY, shaking her head, MORTIFIED:

          STACY
          Oh, god...oh please no...
          Jeff bends close to Mathias's face, listening; he checks
          Mathias's neck for a pulse. A beat, then he turns toward the
          others, shakes his head. Stacy begins to SOB:
          STACY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...
          Eric reaches, takes her into his arms, hugging her.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL -- FROM UP THE HILL - DAWN

          The hillside falls away from us, the narrow trail winding
          down its face to the clearing and the wall of jungle beyond.
          The sun is just rising, and the vine seems to shimmer in it.
          Three of the Mayan encampments are visible from here: one
          directly beneath us, one to the left, another to the right.
          Thin ribbons of smoke rise from their campfires.

          EXT. HILLTOP - TOP OF THE TRAIL - DAY

          Jeff stands there, staring down toward the jungle. Eric and
          Stacy are sitting together in the clearing behind him,
          holding hands; Stacy is still CRYING softly. Amy approaches
          across the hilltop, stops beside Jeff.

          JEFF
          They must've salted the soil.
          That's the only way I can think.
          He turns, glances at Amy. She has no idea what he's talking
          about. He waves down toward the Mayans.

          

          

          

          

          116.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          To keep the ground clear. It grows
          so quickly...
          He gestures at their clothes, upon which that green webbing
          of vine continues to spread, eating away at the fabric.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's old, too--has to be. Really
          old. Because the birds, the
          insects... somehow they've evolved.
          They've learned not to land here.
          (he peers about them, at
          the vine-covered hill)
          And the horses. Remember? How
          frightened they were? They knew,
          too.
          They stand in silence for a beat, staring down the hill
          toward the Mayans. Then Amy reaches, touches Jeff's arm.

          AMY
          It didn't happen.
          Jeff turns, stares at her. she waves back toward the tent.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Eric and I, we were just---

          JEFF
          I know.

          AMY
          And what she said. About spring
          break. I--
          Jeff reaches, presses his finger to her lips.

          JEFF
          Shh.
          Amy falls silent, watching him. He lowers his finger.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Have you made it up with her?
          Amy half-nods, half-shrugs.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Good.

          AMY
          But I want to tell you--

          

          

          

          

          117.
          He presses his finger to her lips again, stopping her. He
          waits a beat, and then:

          JEFF
          I wish it mattered.
          Amy gives him a confused look. Jeff throws out his hand,.
          gesturing at the hilltop, the vine, their tattered clothes.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Look at us.
          (a beat)
          Would it matter to you?
          Amy hesitates, considering. Then she shakes her head. And
          with that, Jeff turns, starts back toward the orange tent.
          WE HEAR a zipping sound, which carries over into:

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Jeff is crouched beside the backboard, UNZIPPING the sleeping
          bag. Eric tosses the flimsy lean-to aside, exposing
          Mathias's corpse-to the sun. Amy and Stacy stand watching.

          JEFF
          Head first?
          Eric considers this, staring down at Mathias's body.
          Mathias's face is burned red from the vine's sap; his legs
          are two blackened stumps. Eric shrugs.

          ERIC
          I guess.

          JEFF
          You'll have to lift him.
          Eric hesitates; he seems reluctant to touch the corpse.
          Finally, he girds himself, straddles the backboard, grabs
          Mathias under his armpits, lifting him. Jeff leans forward,
          starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathias's head.
          The corpse seems intent upon resisting them; its arms keep
          getting tangled, catching and snagging. Jeff and Eric have
          to wrestle with it, both of them PANTING, sweating, before
          they manage to shove it into the bag.
          Jeff ZIPS the bag shut, and they stand over it, catching
          their breath, wiping the perspiration from their faces.

          ERIC
          Should we say something?

          

          

          

          

          118.
          Jeff gives him a blank stare.
          ERIC (cont'd)
          Like, you know ...a prayer?
          Jeff frowns down at the bag, searching for words. Before he
          can find them, Stacy speaks:

          STACY
          Where's the knife?
          They all turn. Her hand is under her tattered shirt,
          pressing at her lower back. Jeff SIGHS:

          JEFF

          STACY--
          She lifts her shirt, twisting to show him. it looks as if a
          large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin.
          It's moving, too, inching slowly but visibly downward. They
          all stare in astonishment.
          Amy GASPS, points at Stacy's leg. Stacy bends to see:
          there's more vine here, a snakelike lump winding its way
          upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh.

          CU - FIRE
          Another small pile of clothes, burning with that blue,
          alcohol-fueled flame.

          AMY (O.S.)
          Can I give her some?
          The knife is placed in the fire, and WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy holds up the bottle of tequila. Jeff is crouching over
          the fire, heating the knife's blade. Be glances toward her,
          nods. Stacy is sitting down, staring at the bulge in her leg
          with a dazed expression. Eric is beside her.
          Amy offers the bottle to Stacy;-they all watch as she takes a
          long swallow. Then she hands the bottle back to Amy, and
          Jeff pulls the knife from the fire, carries it toward her.
          He gestures to Eric and Amy.

          JEFF
          Hold her hands.

          

          

          

          

          119.
          They each take one of her hands. Jeff crouches over her leg.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You might want to shut your eyes.
          Stacy shakes her head.

          STACY
          I want to see.
          Jeff hesitates; for a moment it seems-as if he might argue.
          But then, very quickly, he leans forward and draws the knife
          in one smooth movement up and around Stacy's leg. Stacy
          MOANS, her body tensing, but she doesn't cry out.
          The incision reveals the vine, a foot long, its leaves and
          flowers clotted with Stacy's blood, which is oozing from the
          wound. Jeff reaches in, pries the tendril from her flesh.
          Stacy MOANS again, arching backward, as the vine emerges:
          writhing and twisting. The blood comes more thickly now,
          pumping from the wound, running down her leg.
          Jeff drops the tendril into the dirt, steps on it, grinding
          it into stillness. Stacy is breathing HARD, almost
          hyperventilating. She's shut her eyes.

          JEFF
          Should I stop?
          Stacy shakes her head, vehemently. Jeff glances at the
          others. Eric shakes his head, too. Amy's eyes, like
          Stacy's, are tightly shut.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You'll have to roll over.
          Stacy lets go of the others' hands, rolls onto her stomach.
          She hitches up her shirt, revealing the small of her back,
          the starfish-shaped bulge. Jeff crouches at her side.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Ready?
          She nods, and he leans, makes five quick incisions, in the
          shape of an asterisk, directly above the bulge. Stacy's body
          goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again. Once more, we can
          see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood.
          Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body.
          There's an astonishing amount of it; he has to drop the knife
          and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free.

          

          

          

          

          120.
          As the plant emerges from her body--thrashing, coiling and
          uncoiling, covered in half-clotted blood, like a newborn--
          Stacy starts to SCREAM.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          The Mayans at their campsite: three of them on guard duty,
          the others napping in the shade beneath the trees. Stacy's
          SCREAMING echoes down the hill toward us.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          They've pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks, torn it
          into strips, and used these to bandage Stacy's wounds, tying
          them around her leg and torso. She's lying on her side, eyes
          shut, her head in Eric's lap. He's stroking her hair.
          Jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles. Amy
          sits watching him. When he finishes, he gestures for her to
          take a pile. Then he scoops Stacy and Eric's rations up,
          carries them over.

          JEFF
          Can you eat?
          Stacy sits up, wincing; her bandages are soaked through with
          blood. She takes the grapes from him; Eric does, too. They-
          all begin to eat, in silence. When they're done, Jeff passes
          the water bottle around their circle. Then:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We should try to rest, I guess.
          (he waves toward the tent)
          Get out of the sun. We're losing
          moisture out--

          STACY
          There's more of it.
          She leans forward, probes at her right thigh, prodding the
          skin. The others watch her; there's no bulge visible, no
          sign of the vine-at all. Eric gives her a pained look.

          ERIC
          There's nothing there, Stacy.

          STACY
          It's under the muscle. Down by the
          bone.

          

          

          

          

          121.
          She keeps pushing at her leg. She glances from Eric to Amy
          to Jeff. No one says anything.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Cut me and see. Right here.
          She uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh.

          JEFF
          You're losing too much blood. And
          if any of these get infected---

          STACY
          My calf, too.
          she lifts her right leg, turning it to show the others. Jeff
          bends to look. Again, there's no visible sign of the vine.
          He shakes his head.

          JEFF
          No more cutting. Not unless---
          The knife is in the dirt beside him, and Stacy leans forward,
          tries to grab it. Jeff is too quick for her, though: he
          snatches it up, tucks it into his belt. Stacy is becoming
          more and more upset. She holds out her hands, BEGGING:

          STACY
          Please, Jeff.

          ERIC
          You can't. You can't keep--
          Stacy is starting to CRY; her mouth is trembling.

          STACY
          It's everywhere.
          She's prodding at her body: her legs, her chest and stomach.
          Amy scoots toward her, grasps her hand.

          ANY

          STACY--
          Stacy yanks her hand free, clutches her scalp, WEEPING:

          STACY
          It's in my head! I can feel it in
          my head!
          Amy takes Stacy in her arms, hugging her tight..

          

          

          

          

          122.

          AMY
          Shh.
          Stacy SOBS into Amy's shoulder, her body jumping. Amy
          strokes her. Eric steps across the clearing, picks up the
          bottle of tequila. He glances at Jeff, and Jeff nods.
          AMY (cont'd)
          You're scared, honey. You're just
          scared. You know?
          Stacy nods; she's still CRYING, but it's growing quieter.
          Eric crouches beside her, holds out the bottle of tequila.
          Stacy just stares at it. Amy encourages her:
          AMY (cont'd)
          It'll help.
          Stacy accepts the bottle, takes a long swallow. Then
          another. The others watch her in silence. Finally:
          AMY (cont'd)
          Can you rest some? In the tent?
          Stacy is silent. She wipes the tears from her face.

          STACY
          That girl--
          (she waves at the shaft)
          I keep seeing her. When I shut my
          eyes.

          AMY

          (NODDING)
          I know...I know.
          (she stands up, holds out
          her hand)
          Let's just lie down for a bit.
          Okay?
          Stacy hesitates, staring up at Amy. Then she reaches, grasps
          her hand. Amy pulls her to her feet, helps her hobble across
          the clearing to the tent. Jeff and Eric sit-there, watching
          in silence as they vanish through the flap.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Sunlight filters through the orange nylon; all four of them
          lie sleeping in a row, sweating. The vine has shredded their
          clothes to tatters; they look like castaways. The tent's
          flap hangs open, billowing gently in a slight breeze.

          

          

          

          

          123.
          Stacy open her eyes. She lies there, staring up toward the
          orange nylon above her. The blood on her bandages has dried
          to a dark red, bordering on black. She sits up, stares about
          the tent. Eric is on one side of her, then Amy, then Jeff.
          Jeff is on his back, the knife still tucked into his belt.
          Stacy rises quietly, steps over Amy, crouches above him,
          staring down at the knife. She reaches, tries to slip it
          free, but then jerks back when Jeff shifts in his sleep.
          She hesitates, watching him. She seems as if she's about to
          try again, but then the tent flap billows in the breeze,
          drawing her gaze. A beat, and she rises, steps carefully
          over Jeff, ducks outside into the clearing.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Stacy stands just beyond the tent's.flap. All is still,
          quiet.- She moves to Eric's pack, crouches over it, pulls out
          his phone. She flips it open, stares down at its screen:
          there's still no signal. She drops it back into the pack.
          She turns-to examine the clearing, her eyes falling upon the
          two backpacks from the blue tent. Their pockets are zippered
          open: Jeff and Eric's hurried pillaging during the downpour
          has scattered their contents across the dirt.
          Stacy rises, steps toward this tangled mound. She starts to
          dig through it, casually at first, but then with growing
          intensity, throwing T-shirts and jeans and shorts aside,
          probing deeply into the pile.
          Suddenly she goes still. Staring. Amid the sodden mass of
          clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard.
          As Stacy crouches there, the vines start to RUSTLE, a
          rippling motion passing across them, as. if a wind were
          sweeping the hillside. Stacy watches with a look of horror:
          it looks like the pelt of some giant animal, shaking itself.
          When it finally stops, she bends, reaching for the knife.

          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY

          Jeff, Eric, and Amy, still sleeping. The tent's flap
          continues to billow in the breeze. Very faintly, from the
          clearing, WE HEAR a moan. Then the sound of WHIMPERING.
          Eric opens his eyes, listening. An instant later, very
          abruptly, there comes a sharp, rending SCREAM of pure pain.
          Eric jumps up, starts for the flap; Jeff is right behind him.

          

          

          

          

          124.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Eric emerges from the tent, then Jeff, then Amy. They stand
          there, staring, too horrified to move.

          AMY
          Oh my God.
          Stacy is on the far side of the clearing. She's pulled off
          her shirt, her shorts, and has cut much of the skin from her
          body. She doesn't notice them. She's bent over, slicing
          into her left thigh, peeling the skin back from the muscle.

          ERIC

          STACY--
          She turns, blood-streaked, wild-eyed, the knife in her hand;
          her skin is hanging from her in shreds. We can see her leg
          muscles, her abdominals, a glint of bone at her left elbow.
          Jeff starts forward, holding out his hand, very STERN:

          JEFF
          Give it. Now.
          Eric follows him. Amy stays by the tent; she's begun to CRY.

          AMY
          Please, honey. Just--
          Stacy shakes her head; she's CRYING, too, her whole body
          shaking. Her hair is matted with blood; she looks terrified.

          STACY
          I have to get it out. It's--
          Jeff darts forward, tries to grab the knife from her, and she
          slashes at him, SHOUTING:
          STACY (coat'd)
          Leave me alonel
          The blade slices into his palm. Jeff jumps back, cradling
          his hand at his chest.
          STACY (cont'd)
          I have to--
          Eric steps toward her, from behind, reaching around her body
          for the knife, and she spins, reflexively, trying to fend him
          off. But the knife is in her hand, and it punches into his
          chest, just to the right of his sternum, sticking there.

          

          

          

          

          125.
          Eric looks at the knife in surprise. It's twitching back and
          forth with the beating of his heart. He starts to reach for
          it, but then his legs give out. He collapses, dropping to
          the dirt, which has grown muddy with Stacy's blood.
          Amy SCREAMS.
          Stacy's CRYING deepens; she takes a step toward Eric, but
          then her own body fails her. She falls to her knees in the
          bloody puddle, reaching toward him.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Oh, no...no...no... I'm--
          Eric is on his back; he struggles up onto one elbow. He
          tries to speak, but only a GAGGING sound emerges, blood
          frothing at his mouth. It's pumping thickly from his wound,
          too, saturating his shirt.
          STACY (cont'd)
          I didn't...
          Eric drops back again. He struggles RAGGEDLY for breath.
          Jeff lowers himself to his knees beside him, hesitating
          impotently over him, uncertain what to do. Stacy is SOBBING,
          shaking her head. There's blood everywhere.
          STACY (cont'd)
          Kill me...
          Jeff turns, stares at her. Amy steps forward, crouches
          beside her. She takes Stacy's hand.

          ANY
          Shh.

          STACY
          Please. Just--

          ANY
          Shh.

          STACY
          It hurts. It hurts so much.
          Eric tries to rise again. The blood surges from his wound
          when he moves. Jeff presses him back down.

          JEFF
          Easy. Try to--
          Stacy clutches at Amy, begging, her voice HOARSE with pain:

          

          

          

          

          126.

          STACY
          Kill me. I can't
          She stops in mid-sentence, staring. Jeff and Amy follow her
          gaze. A half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing,
          reaching toward Eric's body.
          Jeff jumps to his feet. The tendrils begin to wrap
          themselves around Eric's limbs, and Jeff bends to tear them
          away. More and more keep coming, though. Eric has started
          to convulse, GAGGING, his head cocked back.
          Jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away, but there are far too
          many of them; they coil around Eric's legs, pulling at him.
          The blood has stopped pumping from his wound; his body has
          gone still.

          AMY
          Jeff I
          She points toward the tent. Jeff turns to see.

          JEFF'S POV - ACROSS THE CLEARING
          The sleeping bag in which they'd enshrouded Mathias is
          moving: he's thrashing about within it, struggling to sit
          up. And he's SHOUTING, too, his voice MUFFLED by the bag:

          MATHIAS'S VOICE

          HENRICH...! HENRICH...!
          He seems to be tearing at the bag with his arms.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Jeff hesitates just for an instant, staring in astonishment,
          then he's sprinting across the clearing. He bends, struggles
          for the zipper.

          JEFF
          It's okay. I'm right here. I'm--
          He UNZIPS the bag, and an immense tangle of vine cascades out
          onto the dirt. Its flowers are a pale pink; they're opening
          and closing, still calling, louder now:

          MATHIAS' S VOICE

          HENRICH...! HENRICH...!
          The thick clot of tendrils writhes spasmodically, coiling and
          uncoiling.

          

          

          

          

          127.
          Entwined within it are Mathias's bones, already stripped
          clean of flesh. The vine falls SILENT. A beat, then it
          starts to laugh, a low mocking CHUCKLE.
          On the opposite side of the little clearing, Stacy begins to
          SCREAM, shaking her head, SOBBING.

          STACY

          KILL ME...! KILL ME...!
          Jeff stands there, perfectly still. Amy is holding Stacy,
          struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her:

          AMY
          Shh. Shh.
          The vine's laughter grows steadily. LOUDER, punctuated by
          Stacy's SHOUTS:

          STACY

          KILL ME...! KILL ME...:
          Amy turns, stares at Jeff. Blood is running off Stacy's body
          in strings. The vine has dragged Eric to the edge of the
          clearing; only his head and torso are still visible. Jeff
          strides toward him.
          STACY (cont'd)

          KILL ME...! KILL ME...!
          Jeff bends, yanks the knife from Eric's chest. Then he
          starts across the clearing toward Stacy.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          The Mayans in their campsite. They're all staring up the
          hill, listening. Stacy's voice ECHOES toward us:

          STACY (O.S.)

          KILL ME...! KILL ME...I KILL--
          And then, abruptly, it goes SILENT.

          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY

          Amy sits beside Stacy, who lies on her back in the puddle of
          blood, arms thrown out, the knife stuck hilt-deep in her
          chest. Eric's body is barely visible at the edge of the
          clearing; the vine RUSTLES softly as it consumes him.

          

          

          

          

          128.
          Jeff is pulling their remaining supplies from his knapsack:
          the bananas, the raisins, the pretzels, the protein bars, the
          nuts, the water, iced tea, and Coke. He has a bloody strip
          of fabric tied around the wound on his hand.
          Amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her. She's
          CRYING silently, tears running down her dirt-smeared cheeks.
          Jeff peels one of the bananas: it's dark brown, far too
          ripe. He holds it out to her. She just stares at it.

          JEFF
          Come on. You'll need the energy.
          He reaches for her hand, puts the banana in it. She holds
          the fruit, but makes no move to eat. Finally, VERY QUIETLY:

          AMY
          I still think we should wait.
          Jeff SIGHS: it's clear they've already been through this.

          JEFF
          You'll only get weaker.

          AMY
          They'll come looking. You said

          THEY'LL--

          JEFF
          Nobody's coming.

          AMY
          Our parents--

          JEFF
          All they'll find are our bones.
          Amy is silent, staring down at the banana.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          We don't have time for this, Amy.
          You'll need as much daylight as
          possible.
          He waves upward, toward the sun, which has passed its peak,
          begun its slow slide westward. Amy squints toward it for a
          beat, and then, almost despite herself, lifts the banana to
          her mouth. She bites, chews, swallows, still mutely crying.
          Jeff peels the second banana; he hands it to her as soon as
          she finishes the first. Be watches her eat,.silent. He's
          tearing open the bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes
          into the clearing.

          

          

          

          

          129.
          They both watch it, neither of them moving. It's joined by a
          second tendril, then a third, a fourth;.the vines coil around
          Stacy's body, begin to drag it from the clearing. Amy's
          CRYING grows more forceful, her body shaking.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Shh.
          Jeff reaches, strokes her. The vine pulls Stacy's body into
          itself, burying it. Amy watches, struggling to control.
          herself. Her voice emerges as little more than a WHISPER:

          AMY
          I don't want to. I don't...
          She shakes her head, wipes at her face: the tears, the snot,
          the sweat, the dirt. Her clothes are falling off her body,
          eaten to shreds. Jeff's, too.
          AMY (cont'd)
          Why can't we both?
          Jeff hesitates a.beat. Then, clearly not believing it:

          JEFF
          We might.
          He hands her the pretzels; she takes them, watching his face.

          AMY
          How?

          JEFF
          It'll take them a moment to react.
          If I can make it to the trees...
          He trails off, shrugs. Amy keeps staring at him; she doesn't
          believe this either. He SIGHS again, holds up his hand,
          pulls the bandage from his wound: it's three inches long, a
          deep gash into his palm.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          How long till it's inside me?
          Amy is silent. He flexes his hand, and the wound opens,
          mouthlike, blood oozing thickly from it.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It already is, probably. I'll be
          just like Stacy soon.
          He turns, glances toward the spot where her body has
          disappeared. Amy looks, too.

          

          

          

          

          130.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Then what? You, all alone on this
          hill... you know how that would end,
          don't you?
          Once more, Amy is silent. He waves for her to keep eating,
          and she starts in on the pretzels, mechanically. He opens
          the can of Coke, hands it to her; she takes a long sip.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Once you're in the jungle, you drop
          and hide.
          Another tendril slithers forward. It slips into the immense
          puddle of blood beside Jeff and Amy, begins to drink it.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          They'll never find you--it's too
          thick in there. Just burrow down,
          and they'll run right past.
          Jeff opens the can of nuts, sets it in front of Amy. Then he
          gets up, crouches over the puddle of blood. He cups. his
          hands, dips them into the puddle. He steps toward Amy,
          smears the blood across her T-shirt. Amy keeps eating.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's sudden movements that'll get
          you caught. So take your time.
          You step, then listen. Then
          another step, and listen again.
          He moves back to the puddle, which the lone tendril continues'
          to drain. He cups his hands, scoops up more blood, smears it
          on her tattered khakis. Amy has finished the pretzels; she
          reaches for the nuts, looking numb..
          JEFF (cont'd)
          East, always east--keep the sun at
          your back.
          He scoops up more blood from the puddle.
          JEFF (cont'd)'
          Arms.
          Amy holds out her arms, and he smears the blood on them.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You'll hear me yell. I'll yell
          your name.

          

          

          

          

          131.
          He returns yet again to the puddle, then stands over her, the
          blood cupped in his hands, dripping.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          And you can't hesitate.
          Understand? Not for an instant.
          Amy nods, and he uncups his hands over her head. She shuts
          her eyes as the blood runs into her hair, down her forehead,
          her neck, her face.

          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

          Three of the Mayan men, as usual, sit in the clearing, bows
          in their laps, facing the hill. The others are sheltering
          from the sun in the line of shade along the jungle's margin,
          some sleeping, some talking quietly together.
          One of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet,
          nocking an arrow. The other two also rise. The Mayans along
          the clearing fall silent, staring up the hill.

          THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL
          Jeff is approaching down the trail, carrying Amy, pieta-like,
          in his arms. Her body is limp, apparently lifeless, and
          dripping with blood.

          BACK TO SCENE
          The bald Mayan emerges from the tree line, followed by yet
          another man with a bow. They join the other three Mayans in
          the center of the clearing. They all watch as Jeff reaches
          the base of the trail, where he carefully lays Amy down.
          Jeff crouches over Amy, laying her arms across her chest,
          pushing the hair from her face. He bends, kisses her blood-
          smeared forehead. Then he glances up at the Mayans.

          JEFF
          You don't even know her name.
          The Mayans just stare at him. He rises to his feet, pulling
          the knife from his belt: it's darkly stained with. blood.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          You should. You should know who
          you're killing.

          

          

          

          

          132.
          He steps out into the clearing. The bald Mayan pulls his
          pistol from its holster, raises it, aiming at Jeff's chest.
          The others draw their bows. Jeff smiles, taps his sternum.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Jeff. Understand? My name's Jeff.
          He edges along the clearing's margin, keeping close to the
          vines, moving away from Amy's body. The Mayans follow him,
          weapons raised. After a handful of steps, he stops again,
          turns toward them.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Can you say it? Huh?
          Again, the Mayans just stare. He SLAPS at his chest.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Jeff.
          A beat, then he suddenly YELLS, waving the knife at the men.
          JEFF (cont'd)

          SAY MY FUCKING NAME!
          Silence. The Mayans stand there with their weapons raised,
          waiting to see what he might do. A beat, then he starts
          walking once more, along the clearing's edge, away from Amy.
          Another ten yards and he stops again, waves up the hill.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          There's Stacy, too. And Eric.
          Mathias. And Henrich. You've
          killed them all.
          He steps toward them. The bald man raises his hand, holds it
          up, palm out, next to his pistol. Jeff smiles at him again.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          But not everyone.
          He LAUGHS, a little wildly, and shakes his head.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          Look at you, you stupid fucks. You
          have no idea what I'm saying, do
          you?
          He takes another step into the clearing. The bald man COCKS
          his pistol, loudly. Several of the other Mayans have emerged
          from the jungle; they stand there watching.

          

          

          

          

          133.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          One of us is gonna survive. You
          should know that name, too. You
          fuckers. You bastards.
          He takes yet another step forward. The bald man speaks a
          string of words IN MAYAN, with an edge of warning. More
          Mayans emerge from-the jungle, shielding their eyes against
          the sun, staring. No one is looking in Amy's direction.
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's not Jeff.
          He shakes his head, his voice dropping, almost to a WHISPER:
          JEFF .(cont'd)
          It's not me.
          He takes another step. And then, still QUIETLY:
          JEFF (cont'd)
          It's Amy. You hear?
          He takes a deep breath, gathering himself. Then he YELLS--
          JEFF (cont'd)

          AMY;
          --and starts to run, straight at the Mayans. He only manages
          three steps before the bald man FIRES his pistol, and the
          others let their arrows fly.
          The bullet hits Jeff in the chest, just beneath his throat.
          One of the arrows misses; the other three strike his stomach,
          his left arm, his right thigh. Before he even hits the
          ground, there's a SHOUT from the Mayans along the treeline.
          The bald man turns. Amy is on her feet, sprinting for the
          jungle. The bald man raises. his pistol, FIRES, but the shot
          is too hurried; it goes wide. The others are still
          scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees.
          The bowmen sprint after her, disappearing into the jungle,
          leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with Jeff. The
          Mayan women stand motionless along the treeline, staring.
          after Amy: they look mortified, grief-stricken.
          Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds, struggling to crawl
          forward, his breath frothing pinkly at his lips. A half
          dozen tendrils slither into the clearing. They coil around
          his legs, start to drag him back toward the hill. Jeff
          fights them, kicking, MOANING, bleeding.

          

          

          

          

          134.
          The bald man watches. He, too, looks grief-stricken. He
          steps forward, aims at Jeff's head. As he FIRES, WE:

          CUT TO A BLACK SCREEN
          WE HEAR footsteps, moving quickly down a tiled floor.

          DOCTOR (O.S.)
          (a slight Spanish accent)
          She flagged down a tour bus, just
          west of Coba--
          The voice CARRIES OVER into:

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOVING - NIGHT

          A Mexican DOCTOR, in his late fifties, balding, a little
          stooped, his white jacket buttoned over a shirt and tie, is
          hurrying down the corridor, accompanied by TERESA, a dark-
          haired woman in beige slacks, a blue blouse.
          Teresa has- a leather briefcase, a Blackberry on her belt.
          She's holding Amy's passport,. which she examines as they
          walk. It's smeared with dried blood.

          DOCTOR
          --and collapsed before the driver
          even managed to open the door.
          The corridor is brightly lit, very clean. Rooms open off it
          on either side, and we glimpse the still.forms of sleeping
          patients as we pass, IVs hanging from metal stands beside
          their beds. It's very quiet.
          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          She revived briefly, just after
          they brought her in. She was in
          bad shape--severely dehydrated,
          traumatized, in shock. And
          terribly frightened. It was
          impossible to make any sense of
          what she was saying. She was
          sobbing, hysterical. We had to
          sedate her.
          The doctor has a manila folder under his arm; he opens it,
          pulls out a piece of paper: a color printout of a digital
          photo. He hands it to Teresa.
          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          Her clothes were torn; she was
          covered in blood. But not her own.

          

          

          

          

          135.
          Teresa stares down at the photo: it shows Amy on a gurney,
          unconscious, blood-smeared, corpse-like.

          TERESA
          Now do you know?

          DOCTOR
          She has no wounds.
          A uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the
          rooms at the end of the corridor, reading a newspaper. He
          rises as they approach. Teresa hands the printout back to
          the doctor; she keeps the passport.

          TERESA
          That's it? That's all you have?

          DOCTOR
          I'm afraid so.
          Be nods to the policeman, and leads Teresa into:

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          A bed, a night stand, a curtained window. Amy lies with a
          sheet pulled to her chin, unconscious, an IV dripping into
          her arm. They've cleaned the blood off her.
          A NURSE sits in a chair beside the bed. She's in her early
          twenties, with long dark hair tied in a bun. She stands up,
          stepping back from the bed, as the doctor and Teresa enter.
          The doctor addresses her in SUBTITLED SPANISH:

          DOCTOR
          Has she stirred?
          The nurse shakes her head. The doctor moves to the bed. He
          takes Amy's wrist, feeling for her-pulse. Amy's eyes open at
          his touch. She stares at him, her arm hanging limply in his
          grasp. He smiles down at her.

          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          There you are...
          Teresa steps forward, and Amy's gaze shifts to her.

          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          My name is Dr. Hernandez...

          Amy's eyes return to the doctor;. they fall on his face, then
          drift down to his chest. The doctor gestures toward Teresa:

          

          

          136.

          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          And this is Ms. Bern, from the U.S.
          Consulate.
          Amy is staring at his white coat, her expression going slack,
          almost catatonic, all the life draining from it.

          DOCTOR (cont'd)
          we were hoping you might be able to
          shed a little light on what you've
          been through...

          Amy is silent, still staring with that dead look in her eyes
          at the doctor's coat: a faint green web of vine has taken
          root there, spreading across the white fabric. WE HOLD on it
          for a beat, and then:



          THE END
SAW

                                          Written by

                                  James Wan & Leigh Whannell


 
               Darkness.

               The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. 
               From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way 
               downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under 
               the water part of a young mans face. His eyes are closed. The 
               light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S 
               A W. The title fades away.
 
               The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the 
               end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. The camera 
               cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. 
               Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his 
               mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within 
               the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging 
               it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the 
               tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached 
               to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just 
               barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the 
               tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. 
               He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes 
               that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over 
               to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain 
               that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, 
               and a bit hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Help! Someone help me! (He stops when 
                         he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere 
                         in the room. He looks out into the darkness 
                         and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! 
                         (He turns back to the corner to which 
                         he is chained, says in a slightly softer 
                         but still panicked voice) Shit, Im 
                         probably dead.
 
               Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy 
               voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs 
               to LAWRENCE.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre not dead.

               Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his 
               arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever 
               is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Whos that? Whos that?!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice strangely a bit on the calm 
                         side, and almost irritated with Adams 
                         reaction to the situation. This shall 
                         be his tone for many scenes to come.) 
                         Theres no point in yelling, I already 
                         tried it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Turn on the lights!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would if I could.

                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is going on? Where am 
                         I? (He turns into his corner, touching 
                         the wall.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I dont know yet.

                                     ADAM
                         (smelling something; in disgust) What 
                         is that smell?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found 
                         something.
 
               With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very 
               bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, 
               starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam. As they 
               come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch 
               black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms 
               to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his 
               mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped 
               shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned 
               rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally 
               start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see 
               Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing 
               by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of 
               the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He 
               wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. 
               He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair 
               and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men 
               are barefoot.
 
               Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. 
               Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does 
               Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror 
               on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has 
               blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only 
               boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his 
               right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream 
               are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360° angle above 
               and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him.
 
               
               The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.

                                     ADAM
                         Holy shit!

               He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. 
               Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying 
               the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing 
               and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around 
               the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely 
               freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming) HELP!!! (He falls back onto 
                         his bottom on the floor as he yanks 
                         at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! 
                         Help!
 
               Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, 
               appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite 
               being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled 
               reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No one can hear you.

               Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, 
               his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore 
               but still just as hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is this?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Calm down, just calm down. (He knows 
                         that to remain calm is to remain in 
                         control, something he must be no matter 
                         what the situation.) Are you hurt?
 
                         
               Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.

                                     ADAM
                         I dont know...yeah!

               Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against 
               it for support.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calmly) Whats your name?

                                     ADAM
                         (sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking 
                         Confused! (demanding) Whats your name? 
                         Whats going on here?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll; hes getting more 
                         and more aggravated with Adams behaviour) 
                         My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. 
                         I just woke up here, just like you. 
                         (He reaches up, wipes his face with 
                         his sleeve)
 
               Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains 
               once more, but not with his prior panic. He winces at the metal 
               biting into his skin.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (in pain) Ah!

               Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck 
               in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Recognize him?

               Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look 
               at the body, just shakes his head.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sharply) No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get SOMETHING out of this 
                         kid) Well, do you have any idea how 
                         you got here?
 
                                     ADAM
                         No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Whats the last thing you remember?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor, 
                         stops pulling at his chains for a moment.) 
                         I went to bed in my shithole apartment, 
                         and woke up in an actual shithole. (He 
                         raises his left leg slightly, starts 
                         trying to pull his foot out of the iron 
                         cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has 
                         moved over to the wall to his left, 
                         bent over slightly and resting a hand 
                         against a pipe.) So what about you, 
                         huh?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (He shrugs slightly, shaking his head.) 
                         Well theres...theres not much to tell, 
                         really. (Across the room, Adam gives 
                         up with the chain for the time being 
                         but remains sitting on the floor.) I 
                         was on my way home from work and uh, 
                         I dont remember anything else.
 
               Adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing 
               on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced 
               simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer.
 
                                     ADAM
                         First dead body Ive ever seen. Look 
                         different in real life. They dont move.
 
                         
               Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against 
               the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         From the looks of these chains, someone 
                         didnt want us to go very far either.
 
                         
               Suddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his 
               abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. 
               He studies himself then glances to Lawrence.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you see any scars?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking at him strangely) What?

                                     ADAM
                         Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures 
                         to his stomach, where there are in fact 
                         no scars.) They kidnap you and drug 
                         you and before you know it, youre in 
                         a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay. 
                         (A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, 
                         but Adam states it with conviction.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a scoffing tone in his voice) No one 
                         has taken your kidneys.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (disbelief) How can you tell from way 
                         over there?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (matter of fact) Because youd either 
                         be in terrible agony, or youd be dead 
                         by now. Trust me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers 
                         his shirt and turns and bends down to 
                         prod at the chain around the pipe again.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah. (He sighs. Hes getting tired 
                         of Adam already. He speaks sharply.) 
                         So, you gonna tell me your name, or 
                         what?
 
               Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again 
               calm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Adam.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting to his feet, his voice a bit 
                         calmer) Well Adam, what we need to do 
                         (he leans with one hand outstretched 
                         against the pipe to his right. Adam 
                         watches him, scared but calm) is start 
                         thinking about why were here. Whoever 
                         brought us there couldve killed us 
                         by now. But they didnt. They must want 
                         something from us. (He looks up and 
                         around the room) Question is what. (He 
                         sees something up on the wall, moves 
                         forwards a bit towards it. We see that 
                         it is a brand new clock on the wall, 
                         ticking away. It reads currently at 
                         10:22.) That clock.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What about it?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its brand new. (squints, studying it)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (not getting what hes implying) So?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs; its quite simple, why cant 
                         Adam see it?) So, someone obviously 
                         wanted us to know the time. (Adam looks 
                         a bit confused still, mulls over that 
                         information. Lawrence thinks for a moment.) 
                         Wait, I think I may be able to reach 
                         that door.
 
               Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the 
               giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he 
               can. In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches 
               down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in 
               the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic 
               baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the 
               envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what 
               it is.
 
               Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances 
               over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding 
               the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro 
               cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on 
               the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence 
               turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what 
               Adam has in his hand.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, 
                         continues looking at the tape. Lawrences 
                         voice grows impatient.) Excuse me.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (glances up briefly at Lawrence, then 
                         back down at the tape. His voice sounds 
                         slightly surprised.) Its a tape.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Where did you find it?

                                     ADAM
                         It was in my pocket.

               Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through 
               his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with LAWRENCE 
               written across it in the same black lettering as Adams.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (regarding his tape) It says Play me.
 
                         
               Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the 
               palm of his hand. First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams. 
               It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying 
               it, not sure what its there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny 
               key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try 
               to unlock his chains with the key. It doesnt seem to be working.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (frustrated, mumbling to himself and 
                         to the key) Come on, come on, come on....
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (seeing that it doesnt seem to be working 
                         on Lawrences lock) Throw it over here.
 
                         
               Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds 
               up the key and throws it. Adam misses the key at first as it 
               hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the 
                         key, then bends down and tries the key 
                         on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt 
                         work. He tries the lock on the chains 
                         around the pipe. It isnt working there 
                         either.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watching him) No?

               Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking 
               his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the 
               shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small 
               loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then 
               bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. 
               He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, 
               trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to 
               four feet between him and the body.

                         Use your shirt.

                                     ADAM
                         (gets back up to his knees) What?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Your shirt.

               Adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue 
               shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each 
               sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. 
               It misses. He tries a second time; same result.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on...

               Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls 
               the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.
 
                                     ADAM
                         It wont work.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get him to not give up yet) 
                         Well, look around, there must be something 
                         else you can use.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (stands, ready to give up, skeptical) 
                         Theres nothing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (insistent) Well there must be something!
 
                         
               Adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, 
               bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long 
               cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels 
               down, holding out the shirt, aiming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, you can do it.

               Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at 
               the end of the tape recorder. He misses.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, come on, again.

               He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets 
               the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam 
               very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the 
               floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and 
               dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, 
               pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a 
               bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so 
               he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice 
               The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression 
               is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre 
                         probably wondering where you are. Ill 
                         tell you where you might be. You might 
                         be in the room that you die in. Up until 
                         now, you simply sat in the shadows, 
                         watching others live out their lives. 
                         But what do voyeurs see when they look 
                         into the mirror? Now, I see you as a 
                         strange mix of someone angry and yet 
                         apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. 
                         So are you going to watch yourself die 
                         today, Adam? Or do something about it? 
                         (end)
 
               Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the 
               message.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I dont get it. (He presses the stop 
                         button on the tape.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (eagerly, gestures.) Throw me the player.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, thinks) No, you throw me your 
                         tape.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a heavy sigh. He looks at Adam as a 
                         slow-minded fool who simply doesnt 
                         understand the full capacity of the 
                         situation that theyre in, and speaks 
                         to him as such.) Look, were going to 
                         have to work together if we want to 
                         get out of here. Now just throw it to 
                         me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (picks up on the tone, speaks defensively) 
                         Im not going to risk breaking it! You 
                         throw me your tape!
 
               Lawrence pauses, looking at Adam as though hed like to smack 
               him, then holds up and tosses the tape. It hits the floor behind 
               Adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. 
               Its the same chilling voice as on Adams tape. As the tape plays, 
               Adam stares at Lawrence, and Lawrence at the tape recorder.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Dr. Gordon, this is your wake 
                         up call. Every day of your working life, 
                         you have given people the news that 
                         they are going to die soon. Now you 
                         will be the cause of death. Your aim 
                         in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam 
                         glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, 
                         then back up at Lawrence) You have until 
                         six on the clock to do it. There sa 
                         man in the room with you. When theres 
                         that much poison in your blood (another 
                         view of the body from Lawrences POV), 
                         the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. 
                         (Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win 
                         this hidden all around you. Just remember: 
                         X marks the spot for the treasure. If 
                         you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison 
                         and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And 
                         Ill leave you in this room to rot. 
                         Let the game begin. (end)
 
               The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. 
               Lawrence stands up.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (firmly) Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses 
                         him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, 
                         plays back. Adam stands up from his 
                         spot on the floor.)
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape)...then Alison and Diana will 
                         die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you 
                         in this room to rot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking, trying to figure this out) 
                         Any idea who that is?
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     ADAM
                         He knows us.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Wait a minute. (rewinds more)

                                     ADAM
                         (false hope) What do you think? Probably 
                         a joke, right?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh, shh! (presses play)

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (softly) Listen...

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after 
                         a brief silence)...Follow your heart.
 
                         
               Lawrence stops the tape.

                                     ADAM
                         What the hell does Follow your heart 
                         mean?
 
               Lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else 
               in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown 
               on the toilet next to Adam and points.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         There! Right next to you, on the toilet.
 
                         
               Adam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his 
               hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, 
               not really sure what hes looking for.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (impatient, gesturing) Come on, come 
                         on.
 
               Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of Youve got to be kidding 
               me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches 
               in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, 
                         his face turned away from the bowl. 
                         He coughs, fishes around for another 
                         brief moment, then quickly pulls back, 
                         trying to shake some of the shit off 
                         of his hand, spitting.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (expectantly) Anything?

                                     ADAM
                         (disgusted) No solids.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Take off the lid. (He points to the 
                         lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands 
                         up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no 
                         patience.) Come on!
 
               Adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The 
               water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something 
               wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence 
               to see, turns to him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I really wish I had checked in there 
                         first.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it?
 
                         
               Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. 
               He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, 
               holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain 
               with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence 
                         speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing 
                         me the other one?
 
               Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully 
               throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrences left. 
               Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the 
               floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied 
               with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag 
               and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at 
               their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. 
               Suddenly, Adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently, 
                         hitting the broken saw twice against 
                         the iron pipe then turns and hums it 
                         across the room, right into a mirror. 
                         A small piece of the mirror breaks off 
                         and flies to the floor.)
 
               Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to 
               sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, 
               leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives 
               up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also 
               breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of 
               realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking 
               at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his 
               head slightly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (everything is becoming more clear now) 
                         He doesnt want us to cut through our 
                         chains. He wants us to cut through our 
                         feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows 
                         raised.) I think I may know whos done 
                         this to us.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What did you say? (he stands up; is 
                         Lawrence hiding something from him?)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its not someone I know personally. 
                         Its...just someone I know of.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (getting slightly frantic again) Jesus 
                         Christ! Tell me, who is it?!
 
               The camera closes up on Lawrences face. To the right of it, 
               the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. As Lawrence 
               speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, 
               until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking 
               down a flight of stairs.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         The last I heard...the police still 
                         hadnt caught him.
 
               
               We now see the three figures descending through a trap door down 
               a flight of stairs. The lighting is a bright lime green that 
               is strangely dark at the same time. The trio enters a small, 
               cell like room with a low ceiling. They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY. 
               Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early fifties. Sing 
               is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties, and Kerry is a Caucasian 
               woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair 
               that is tied back in a ponytail. All are well dressed, Sing and 
               Tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. They are 
               the detectives working on this case.
 
               As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a 
               look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. We cannot 
               see it yet.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) And the only reason I know that 
                         is because I was a suspect.
 
               Tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, 
               and comes up alongside Sing, looking at the same thing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) Ill start from the beginning.
 
                         
                                     KERRY
                         This ones not fresh anymore. At least 
                         three weeks out. (Detective Tapp squints 
                         as he peers in and studies the body) 
                         Victims a 46-year old male. (Quick 
                         flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup 
                         of behind the mans head and upper back. 
                         There are deep cuts all over. The camera 
                         cuts upwards to the detectives.) Died 
                         of massive blood loss. Mostly through 
                         the femoral artery. (The camera pans 
                         around to Detective Tapp, who moves 
                         around the side fo the cage to get a 
                         better look inside, shining his flashlight 
                         in.) He started at the back of the cage 
                         and tunneled his way through the razor 
                         wire so fast its amazing he got as 
                         far as he did. Cut himself so deep, 
                         we found traces of stomach acid on the 
                         floor. (Another more gruesome crime 
                         scene photo shot of the body from the 
                         side; we can see the razor wire digging 
                         in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot 
                         of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.) 
                         We also found this. (She holds up an 
                         evidence baggie with a micro cassette 
                         tape recorder, just like the one Adam 
                         and Lawrence found in their cell. She 
                         presses the play button, and Tapp and 
                         Sing listen. Its the same chilling 
                         voice from Adam and Lawrences tapes.)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Hello Paul. You are a perfectly 
                         healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet 
                         last month, you ran a straight razor 
                         across your wrists. Did you cut yourself 
                         because you truly wanted to die, or 
                         did you just want some attention? Tonight, 
                         youll show me. The irony is that if 
                         you want to die, you just have to stay 
                         where you are. But if you want to live, 
                         youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback 
                         shot of Paul waking up in the cage, 
                         looking around, scared and confused. 
                         The shots go back and forth between 
                         the detectives and the Paul flashback, 
                         with him grabbing and shaking the razor 
                         wire, screaming. His screams sound distant 
                         under Jigsaws voice.) Find the path 
                         through the razor wire to the door. 
                         But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock 
                         and then this room becomes your tomb. 
                         How much blood will you shed to stay 
                         alive, Paul? (end)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (stopping the tape) The door was on 
                         a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. 
                         Then it slammed shut. He was given two 
                         hours.
 
               Cut back to Detective Tapp, who notices something and shines 
               his light on it. We see a strange wound on Pauls body, a piece 
               of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Jigsaw piece. (Sing looks in as well, 
                         see it. There is a quick flash of crime 
                         scene photos showing a close up of the 
                         wound. Tapp sighs.) I think were gonna 
                         be here for a while, Sing. (Sing looks 
                         to him. We get another quick crime scene 
                         shot of Paul.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) The newspapers started calling 
                         him the Jigsaw Killer.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom. For his next two spoken 
               lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives 
               in the razor wire room.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Actually, technically speaking, hes 
                         not really a murderer. He never killed 
                         anyone.
 
               Sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines Pauls body 
               a bit. A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with 
               a ruler held up to it is shown. More gruesome crime scene photos 
               of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) He finds ways for his victims to 
                         kill themselves.
 
               Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, 
               at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaws voice from a tape recorder 
               play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the 
               flashback shots.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If youre 
                         so sick, then why do I have so many 
                         photos of you up and about? (there is 
                         a quick montage of a camera snapping 
                         several black and white shots of Mark 
                         up and about, looking around and getting 
                         into a car.) Lets put your so-called 
                         illness to the test. (Flashback image 
                         of Mark waking up. He is a younger man 
                         in his mid to late twenties, with dark 
                         brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared 
                         in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. 
                         In front of him is a small, square glass 
                         plate held up by some chains. On the 
                         plate is a micro cassette player, a 
                         lit votive candle, and a box of matches. 
                         He gets up, looking around confusedly 
                         and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting 
                         poison in your veins. The antidote is 
                         in the safe. (Black and white crime 
                         scene shot of the safe, then a shot 
                         of Mark standing over it, screaming, 
                         his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, 
                         as with Paul.) The combination to the 
                         safe (quick montage of several black 
                         and white crime-scene photos of numbers 
                         written all over the walls) is written 
                         on the wall. Hurry up and program it 
                         in. But watch your step (Marks bare 
                         foot steps on the broken glass scattered 
                         all across the floor). And by the way, 
                         thats a flammable substance smeared 
                         on your body (shot of Mark looking at 
                         the ointment on his hand, up his arm, 
                         everywhere), so I would be careful with 
                         that candle, if I were you...
 
                                     MARK
                         (huddled over the safe; screams, but 
                         it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!!
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO ctd)....or all the people youve 
                         burned with your act (Mark starts to 
                         turn the lock on the safe) just might 
                         have their revenge.
 
               We see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, 
               looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera 
               goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing 
               this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the 
               combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to 
               us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from 
               the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up 
               crime scene photo of Marks charred face.
 
               The shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding 
               the tape recorder.
 
                                     KERRY
                         I found something else. Well, two things, 
                         actually. (She moves past them and we 
                         go with her over to a wall where there 
                         is a small hole cut, about an inch or 
                         two in diameter. The light from the 
                         outside shines in.) There was someone 
                         standing outside here watching through 
                         this peephole. Looks like our friend 
                         Jigsaw likes to book himself front row 
                         seats to his own sick little games. 
                         He was there at the last one as well. 
                         (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only 
                         this time, he left us his penlight. 
                         (She holds up the penlight in an evidence 
                         baggie, clicking it twice then handing 
                         it to Tapp.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         (taking the baggie, studying it) Get 
                         a rush on the prints. (He hands it back 
                         to her.)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (taking the baggie, moving out of the 
                         room) Copy that.
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Hospital room. Lawrence in his white 
                         doctors coat along with three blue-scrub 
                         clad medical students. A nurse in white 
                         stands off to the side. Lawrence is 
                         going over the patients charts. He 
                         goes over to the x-ray display, pushing 
                         the light on to view two x-rays of someones 
                         skull. He points to it with his pen 
                         as he speaks.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. This patient has an inoperable 
                         frontal lobe tumor extending across 
                         the midline. Started as colon cancer. 
                         (He turns back to the three young medical 
                         students. One of them, a pretty Asian 
                         girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence 
                         as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated 
                         with him.) The patient has come in for 
                         a standard checkup by which we are able 
                         to monitor the rate at which his condition 
                         is declining.
 
               In the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies 
               is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical 
               students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This 
               is Zep. Hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly 
               whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a 
               kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, 
               and something else below the surface. He glances down at John 
               sleeping, then up at Lawrence.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         The patient had...

                                     ZEP
                         (cutting him off) His name is John, 
                         Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, 
                         who we see is a man in his late forties-early 
                         fifties, hairless except for a small 
                         white goatee. His head is to the side 
                         and he is sleeping. On the tray table 
                         in front of him is a notebook and some 
                         colored pencils. As Zep looks at him 
                         and speaks of him, there is caring in 
                         his voice, something Dr. Gordon has 
                         yet to display regarding this patient.) 
                         Hes a very interesting person.
 
               Lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but 
               maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face 
               and he nods. His tone matches his look.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you for that information, Zep. 
                         (he looks to the students, who all share 
                         his smug smile) As you can see, our 
                         orderlies form very special bonds with 
                         the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, 
                         his expression mostly blank but with 
                         pure loathing just underneath the surface. 
                         The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. 
                         Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, 
                         then turns away, and continues down 
                         the hall with his cart.) Continuing 
                         on, the patient....
 
               But he is cut off by a voice on the intercom.

                                     INTERCOM
                         Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please 
                         page the operator.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a smug but annoyed smirk) Obviously 
                         someone doesnt want me to tell you 
                         what the patient has. Excuse me. (He 
                         steps around the students, leaves the 
                         room. The three students watch after 
                         him with great admiration.)
 
               Cut to Lawrences office at the hospital . Inside, Tapp is leaning 
               against Dr. Gordons chair, studying the various framed degrees 
               on the wall. Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across 
               from the desk, twisted around in his seat to look at a couple 
               of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him. Lawrence 
               opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look 
               at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the 
               door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this 
                         is Detective Sing, City Homicide. (he 
                         gestures to the degrees on the wall.) 
                         Very impressive.
 
               Lawrence smiles, pretending to care about what they think, truly 
               just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more 
               of his time. As he speaks, he walks over to the chair behind 
               his desk.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits 
                         in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next 
                         to Sing across from him. Sing studies 
                         him silently, chewing gum.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sorry to interrupt you while youre 
                         working.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats fine. Now, how can I help you 
                         gentlemen?
 
               Tapps tone turns a bit more serious, but still amiable enough.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Are you able to tell us where you were 
                         between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 
                         1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his tone just barely masking his concern) 
                         Why is it that youre interested?
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Wed like to ask you a few questions 
                         about it. For your sake, I think its 
                         best if we do it down at the station. 
                         Would you like to follow us there?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Shaking his head, this is unbelievable) 
                         No, Im afraid thats...thats quite 
                         out of the question. I cant just leave, 
                         I have work to do. Plus, my wife has 
                         the car today, so...
 
                                     SING
                         (amiable but hinting that he knows something) 
                         Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. 
                         Doc.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (chuckles uncomfortably) Im sorry, 
                         youll have to tell me again. What is 
                         this all about?
 
               Tapp produces the penlight from his pocket, holds it up for Dr. 
               Gordon.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Is this yours, Doctor?

               He puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, 
               a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly 
               covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives 
               carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them.
 
               
               Cut to the Police Station. In an interrogation room, Lawrence 
               paces back and forth nervously, now wearing his suit jacket. 
               His lawyer sits at the table, taking notes.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         So you have no idea how your penlight 
                         showed up at the murder scene?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Of course not!

                                     LAWYER
                         I have to ask. What were you doing last 
                         night.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt 
                         in his voice. As much as he would allow.) 
                         I was seeing someone.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         (a slight pause) Who? (Lawrence doesnt 
                         answer, just continues his pacing. The 
                         lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts 
                         down his pen.) Look, if you cant be 
                         honest with me...
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His tone quick, almost blurting) I 
                         was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. 
                         Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. 
                         Hes fucked, either way.) What am I 
                         gonna do?
 
                                     LAWYER
                         Well, as your lawyer and your friend, 
                         my advice to you is to bite the bullet 
                         and give them your alibi now. Because 
                         no one is going to believe you later.
 
                         
               Cut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the 
               wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against 
               his knee.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs) That was five months ago. He 
                         tried to set me up for murder.
 
               Cut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence 
               is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts 
               it behind him.
 
                                     SING
                         Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds 
                         up. (His voice indicates that he still 
                         believes theres more to it; he does 
                         not and will not trust Lawrence.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Good! Can I go home now?

                                     SING
                         (continuing) We have one of the victims 
                         who managed to escape. (As he speaks, 
                         we see a young woman with brown hair 
                         in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass 
                         being led carefully into the room next 
                         to them and sat at a table. This is 
                         AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her 
                         clearly; she cannot see them.) Want 
                         to know if you wouldnt mind sticking 
                         around and listening to her testimony? 
                         Maybe itll trigger something. (Tapp 
                         and an unidentified bald black man in 
                         a suit enter the room. The man guides 
                         Amanda into her chair, stands behind 
                         her against the wall. Tapp sits in a 
                         chair to her left.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt really care) Id like to help, 
                         really, but...
 
                                     SING
                         (cutting him off quickly, wont let 
                         him out of this that easily) Well, wed 
                         really appreciate it. Shes the only 
                         one who made it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (quietly, giving in.) Okay.

               Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and 
               the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves 
               closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer 
               to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side 
               of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking 
               anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind 
               is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in 
                         your own time, tell me the first thing 
                         you remember.
 
               We move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera 
               spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, 
               her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting 
               as Pauls cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron 
               contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering 
               her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, 
               as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was 
                         blood. (The camera moves back quickly, 
                         and we see her tied to the chair, her 
                         wrists bound to the arms of the chair. 
                         She pulls against her bonds, moaning 
                         loudly, trying to speak or cry out but 
                         cannot.) And metal.
 
               She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera 
               circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device 
               on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long 
               wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen.
 
               The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an 
               old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. 
               After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented 
               clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, 
               its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at 
               it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. 
               The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         (The video moves next to the doll, to 
                         a device like the one shes wearing 
                         attached to a mannequin head. As he 
                         continues, explaining what it is, her 
                         breathing grows faster and heavier, 
                         and her moans pick up more.) The device 
                         youre wearing is hooked into your upper 
                         and lower jaws. When the timer at the 
                         back goes off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open. Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap. Here, Ill show you.
 
               The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The 
               dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera 
               zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! 
               The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. 
               Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to 
               a close up of the doll.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) There is only one key 
                         to open the device. Its in the stomach 
                         of your dead cellmate. Look around, 
                         Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You 
                         better hurry up. Live or die. Make your 
                         choice.
 
               The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda 
               begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the 
               chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements 
               fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the 
               other and stands up quickly. Thats when the cord in the back 
               of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, 
               her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins 
               its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling 
               at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck 
               there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she 
               can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.
 
               
               The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in 
               the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, 
               who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.
 
               
                                     AMANDA
                         And then I saw the body.

               We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see 
               near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. 
               Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, 
               her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next 
               to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his 
               shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. 
               She sobs harder, hunched over him.
 
               Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of 
               the shot.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         There was a knife.

               Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small 
               knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her 
               shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick 
               shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. 
               The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when...
 
               HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to 
               speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He 
               cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged 
               him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; 
               he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to 
               do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly 
               stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs 
               down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands.
 
               
               A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, 
               eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as 
               she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table 
               in Lawrences interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence 
               baggie with a used syringe in it.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) Hed 
                         been injected with an opiate overdose. 
                         He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You mean....he was alive?

                                     SING
                         (staring, nods slightly) Was.

               Back to Amandas Interrogation room, her head still hung, still 
               sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks
 
                                     TAPP
                         What happened after you took it off?
 
                         
               Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines 
               for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back 
               again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to 
               interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then 
               back to the cell.
 
               Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes 
               holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying 
               to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. 
               She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the 
               back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it 
               snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching 
               scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking 
               back and forth.
 
               Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing 
               the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring 
               at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares 
               at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only 
               stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering 
               at her, then speaks.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Congratulations. You are still alive. 
                         Most people are so ungrateful to be 
                         alive. But not you. Not anymore.
 
               Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, 
               her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight 
               spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt 
                         that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesnt 
                         look up.) Do you think that is why he 
                         picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly 
                         nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy?
 
                         
               She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first 
               time.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (softly) He...helped me.

               As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks 
               over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. 
               He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then 
               cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, 
               the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into 
               an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are.
 
               
               Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has 
               been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) Are you sure its him?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nods slightly) Yeah, Im sure.

                                     ADAM
                         (becoming a little hysterical again. 
                         He speaks accusingly) How do I know 
                         youre telling the truth? You can be 
                         the one who put me in this room! (he 
                         gesticulates as he speaks, pointing 
                         to Lawrence and himself.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as 
                         to a simpleton) Im in exactly the same 
                         situation youre in.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained 
                         foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! Youve got 
                         one thing I dont: Information! (He 
                         hovers as close as he can in a threatening 
                         pose, pointing) You know who did this! 
                         (He picks up a glass shard that fell 
                         when he broke the mirror, holds it up 
                         threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either 
                         tell me what is really going on (Lawrence 
                         rolls his eyes, turns his head over 
                         to his left, away from Adam) or Ill 
                         cut you with this, you hear me? Ill 
                         cut- (But he stops short as he sees 
                         something in the glass. He flips it 
                         over, studying it, flips it back. He 
                         looks over to the mirror on the wall, 
                         studying it, thinking.)
 
               Lawrence notices that Adams ranting has ended, glances over 
               at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         (looks over at Lawrence, then back at 
                         the mirror.) Its a two-way mirror.
 
                         
               Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches 
               over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a 
               loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can 
               against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly 
               startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam 
               reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that 
               at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass 
               breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind 
               a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. 
               We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it 
               as well.
 
               Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking 
               at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and 
               Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The 
               shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver 
               surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type 
               equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans 
               voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the 
               Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove 
               raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS, Taunting) I can see you...

                                     ADAM
                         (from on video) So thats what this 
                         is. Reality TV.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS. Still taunting, sounds as though 
                         on a power trip) Dont look at me. I 
                         cant help you.
 
               The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular 
               view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the 
               camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with 
               sarcasm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having 
                         a blast. (he bends down and picks up 
                         another piece of debris from the floor) 
                         This is the most fun Ive had without 
                         lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris 
                         at the window. It makes a thwacking 
                         sound, but doesnt break. Not even a 
                         crack.) Make sure youre getting everything. 
                         (Bends down, throws picks up and throws 
                         another piece of debris. It hits, but 
                         no breakage. Leans down for another 
                         piece.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying 
                         to break the glass) Thats not going 
                         to do anything.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, looks to Lawrence) You just 
                         want to leave it running on us? (the 
                         shot switches to surveillance view)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very matter-of-fact) Well, you wont 
                         stop it. (shot switches to regular view) 
                         Thats why we cant cut through these 
                         chains. Its why you wont break that 
                         glass. (he gestures to the pipe then 
                         the glass) Every possible angle has 
                         been pre-thought out by him. (He appears 
                         deep in thought, starting to understand 
                         the set-up more so, figuring out the 
                         way this guy thinks. Almost admiring 
                         him. The situation may be bad, but its 
                         a brilliant design.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         You sound like you admire this prick.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (explaining) To overcome something, 
                         you have to understand what a perfect 
                         engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. 
                         (He looks up at the ceiling, at the 
                         walls, around the room) Now the tape 
                         told us to find an X. That X has to 
                         be somewhere in this room. (determined) 
                         Help me find it.
 
               Adam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrences 
               calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is 
               almost becoming as sick of Lawrences attitude as Lawrence is 
               of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when 
                         your wife and kid are out there. (Shot 
                         of Lawrence looking around the room) 
                         Hes got them, too. (Shot of the clock; 
                         its now 12:05.) He could be doing anything 
                         to them right now. Are you thinking 
                         about that?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Suddenly looks right at him, snaps 
                         angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam 
                         backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, 
                         his voice changes to calm but sad.) 
                         Ive been the last thing I said to my 
                         daughter.
 
               Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind 
               him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot 
               of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl 
               is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light 
               brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite 
               teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over 
               her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling 
               very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above 
               her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits 
               up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She 
               remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner 
               to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her 
               face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly 
               heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a 
               strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of 
               the Gordon Household.
 
               The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of 
               the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture 
               in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of 
               a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as 
               it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room 
               towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy 
               bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted 
               glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into 
               the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, 
               fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long 
               blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite 
               her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into 
               the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching 
               her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of 
               being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. 
               She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter 
               with concern.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes 
                         back the covers and gets up, crouching 
                         down in front of her daughter. Looking 
                         up at her, she places her hands on her 
                         daughters arms.) Diana, Honey, can 
                         you hear me?
 
                                     DIANA
                         (very softly, but showing almost no 
                         fear) Mommy?
 
               Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand 
               down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Oh, what is it, sweet pea?

                                     DIANA
                         (very calmly) Theres a man in my room.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (sighing, but not rudely. This is not 
                         the first time this has happened) Oh 
                         Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding 
                         in your imagination?
 
                                     DIANA
                         He talked to me.

                                     ALISON
                         (sighs) Okay, Ill come and check your 
                         room. (She smiles a small, assuring 
                         smile)
 
                                     DIANA
                         I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (her smile fading a bit) Alright, if 
                         you want. Come on.
 
               She stands and leads Diana out of the room. Cut to Lawrences 
               office. Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer, 
               focused on some paper hes writing. Diana and Alison appear in 
               the doorway to his left. He doesnt even look up, just keeps 
               typing. Alisons tone when she speaks indicates that she knows 
               hell probably say no, or put it off on her.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry, sorry to bother you, but your 
                         daughter had a bad dream again.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes never leaving the screen; 
                         raises his finger to pause them) Just 
                         a minute.
 
                                     ALISON
                         She wants you to check her room.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (keeps typing, never looks up) Mmm hmm, 
                         mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.
 
                         
               Alison waits a moment, then turns to Diana.

                                     ALISON
                         (softly) You know what sweetie? Ill 
                         go check with you.
 
               They turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes 
               typing, then closes the laptop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Nope! Im done. (he smiles, turning 
                         to look at them.)
 
               Cut to Dianas room. Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp 
               on Dianas side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up 
               against her pillows and stuffed animals. Lawrence sits on the 
               side of her bed.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very reassuringly) See? (he pulls the 
                         covers up over her, up to her chest.) 
                         Theres no one in your room. Theres 
                         no such thing as the bad man. Now can 
                         you go to sleep?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Im still scared.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls 
                         back the covers and she pulls out her 
                         foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, 
                         what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, 
                         raising his eyebrows up) Remember this 
                         one? (He counts on her toes as he says 
                         the following) This little piggy went 
                         to market, this little piggy stayed 
                         home, this little piggy had roast beef, 
                         this little piggy had none, and this 
                         little piggy went Weeee! (he tickles 
                         up her leg to her tummy and she giggles) 
                         all the way home!
 
               Just then, Lawrences beeper goes off. He leans back, takes it 
               out and looks at it.
 
                                     DIANA
                         I hate that thing.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. 
                         You know what Daddys job is like. Now, 
                         come on. (he re-tucks her in, she smiles 
                         at him.) Lets see. Try and get some 
                         sleep now, okay? (He gives her a kiss, 
                         smiles, stands up and goes to the door.)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         Youre not going to leave us, are you, 
                         Daddy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (suddenly concerned) What? (He stops 
                         at the door, turns, goes back over to 
                         her bed, sits down next to her and leans 
                         over. This was the last thing hed expected 
                         her to say) What are you talking about? 
                         You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She 
                         nods; he reaches up and gently brushes 
                         her hair away from her face.) No, no 
                         sweetheart, I would never do that. Who 
                         gave you that idea?
 
                                     DIANA
                         No one.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well its not true, okay?

                                     DIANA
                         (very softly) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         How much do I love you?

               He moves his face closer to her and together they say

                                     LAWRENCE & DIANA
                         Love you very much

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats right, thats right! (He gives 
                         her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, 
                         sweetie.
 
                                     DIANA
                         Good night, Daddy.

               Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. 
               He pauses before he steps out.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite 
                         story.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (with a small smile) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. (he goes out.)

               Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence. Lawrence 
               walks towards the door, Alison behind him. Alisons voice starts 
               to cut over the scene. Her tone is very pissed off.
 
                                     ALISON
                         I dont know how much longer I can do 
                         this, Larry.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounds as though he has no idea what 
                         she means) What, what are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed, in disbelief) How can you walk 
                         through life pretending that youre 
                         happy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy.

                                     ALISON
                         (confrontational) That is complete bullshit. 
                         (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her 
                         side in her darkened room, clutching 
                         her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes 
                         are open, she can hear everything. We 
                         stay with her for the rest of Alisons 
                         line, her voice now off a bit in the 
                         distance but still very audible) Id 
                         rather you break down and tell me that 
                         you hated me. At least thered be some 
                         passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would you like to see her? (He reaches 
                         into his pocket and takes out his wallet, 
                         throws it across the room to Adam, who 
                         is sitting with his back against the 
                         wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up 
                         the wallet and opens it. He sees two 
                         pictures of Diana, side by side. The 
                         one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. 
                         The one on the right is a smiling portrait 
                         outside somewhere.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Shes beautiful.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you.

                                     ADAM
                         (sighs, then looks up at Lawrence) You 
                         gonna have any more kids?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a bit wearily, but not snobby) Weve 
                         talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, 
                         its difficult enough to concentrate 
                         on one. (The tone of his voice indicates 
                         that maybe hes starting to realize 
                         that he shouldve spent more time and 
                         attention to his daughter.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (referring to the wallet) So wheres 
                         the lucky wife? (a small smile)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Theres another picture behind the one 
                         youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind 
                         the photo on the right and pulls another 
                         photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly 
                         as he speaks) Its my favourite one 
                         because were all in it together. Someone, 
                         usually me, has to hold the camera, 
                         which means Im always missing from 
                         the photos.
 
               Cut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is 
               blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to 
               a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence 
               described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, 
               and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. 
               He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads 
               it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) X Marks the spot. Sometimes you 
                         see more with your eyes shut.
 
               Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Its uh, its not here.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight disturbance from his momentary 
                         nostalgic bliss) What?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Uh, this photo youre talking about...its 
                         not here.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (slightly surprised, reaching out his 
                         hand for Adam to toss the wallet.) Really? 
                         Are you sure?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah. (Tucking the picture in his right 
                         hand, he shifts slightly by lifting 
                         himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily 
                         putting the photograph down and tossing 
                         the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence 
                         picks up the wallet and starts looking 
                         for it, creasing his brow in concern, 
                         while Adam backs up against his wall, 
                         holding the photograph out of Lawrences 
                         sight against a pipe he rests his arm 
                         on as he looks at the photograph.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief, shaking his head) He...he 
                         mustve taken it. I...
 
               Alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to 
               look through the wallet, and we hear Alisons voiceover from 
               the scene in the main hall.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (VO) How can you walk through life pretending 
                         that youre happy?
 
               CUT TO the Main Hall of the Gordon Residence, back to the earlier 
               flashback of Lawrence and Alison. This time, we stay with them.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, 
                         leaning over it as he puts something 
                         down, gets his briefcase ready to go 
                         to work. Alison stands a few feet behind 
                         him, trying her best to get him to react, 
                         to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed) That is complete bullshit. 
                         Id rather you break down and tell me 
                         that you hated me. At least thered 
                         be some passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (tired of this, brushing it off as not 
                         that important, like there really is 
                         nothing wrong) We can talk about this 
                         alter, okay? (He leans in to kiss her, 
                         but she shakes her head. He pauses there.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (firmly) Just leave.

               He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away 
               and heads out the door.
 
                                     VOICE
                         Goodnight, little girl. (camera pans 
                         up closer into the closet, and we a 
                         widened blue eye and part of a face 
                         (yet unidentifiable) watching her.)
 
                         
               The closet doors burst open and Diana screams. Cut back to the 
               main hall where Alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. 
               As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her 
               daughters room.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana!?

               Alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         Diana! (opens the door and flips on 
                         the light, gasps when she sees a figure 
                         covered by a blanket looming over Dianas 
                         bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana 
                         and she screams, struggling against 
                         him. Alison goes for them.
 
               Quick cut to NOW, in Alison and Lawrences bedroom. Waistline 
               shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and 
               blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. A gun is tucked into his belt 
               and Dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. He saunters over 
               to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied 
               to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, 
               struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but 
               fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing.
 
               
               The figure crouches down beside Diana, dropping the teddy bear 
               behind her, his face still unseen. He takes the stethoscope and 
               holds the end to Dianas chest. The sound of a loud, steady heartbeat 
               is heard. Alison screams at him through her gag.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from 
                         her!
 
               He pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. He reaches 
               with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. Dianas 
               screams become more desperate, Alisons more frantic, more angry. 
               He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves 
               the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her 
               mothers head. We hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.
 
               
                                     ALISON
                         (through her gag) Keep your motherfucking 
                         hands off of my daughter!
 
               He pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back 
               into his belt. He reaches down behind Diana and picks up the 
               teddy bear. As he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower 
               half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. 
               He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a moment then 
               tucks it in front of her. He pats her on the head and stands 
               up, moving over to the window. He parts the curtains slightly 
               and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. It 
               is Zep, the orderly from the hospital.
 
               Cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior 
               of the Gordon home, of the window where Zep is standing. The 
               camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         (VO as we view shot of Zep) Who are 
                         you little man...I see you...(cut to 
                         a television screen with the video of 
                         Zep in the window. Fade back and to 
                         the right as we get a view of someones 
                         apartment. Plastered on the walls are 
                         various photographs, which we can barely 
                         make out, and a desk in the corner with 
                         some recording equipment. As we move 
                         further right and hit the window we 
                         see Detective Tapp, leaning over the 
                         camera shooting the Gordons window, 
                         adjusting the view. Something about 
                         him seems just not right. We cut back 
                         to his view from the camera.) Does Dr. 
                         Gordon know youre at home with his 
                         wife? I know you know something. (his 
                         voice goes up a bit louder) What are 
                         you doing in there? Waiting for the 
                         doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, 
                         too. Hmm.
 
               Cut to a view over Tapps couch of the television with Zep on 
               video on the screen. Tapp walks over and sits down in front of 
               the television, his back to us.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I never should have let you go...

               Camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. 
               It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw 
               hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre 
               Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of 
               Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging 
               dead in his cage Killer Preaching Says Top Cop, Psychopath 
               Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking 
               for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over 
               the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniacs Game quick flashback 
               footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with 
               her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her 
               testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence 
               being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It 
               ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through 
               the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot 
               slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack) 
                         I never shouldve let you go...
 
               The car pulls up alongside a building, with Lawrence in the passenger 
               seat, and Tapp driving. Lawrences awkwardness, Tapps distrust, 
               and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between 
               them.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Pretending like hes trying to be helpful, 
                         really just glad to be out of Tapps 
                         company) Here we are. That was uh, quite 
                         an amazing story that poor woman told. 
                         (Tapp just nods, says nothing. Lawrence 
                         smiles very uncomfortably, gets out 
                         of the car.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (leaning down and looking back into 
                         the car window.) Look, Im sorry I cant 
                         be of more help to your investigation.
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         (nods very slightly) You know, we arrested 
                         a dentist last week who like to play 
                         with kids a bit too much. He lived two 
                         blocks from here. The sewer lines run 
                         under this neighborhood too, Doctor.

               Lawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp waits a moment, 
               then drives off.
 
               BAM into static and then the video from Amandas cell. We are 
               not at Tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively 
               watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. 
               As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television 
               to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the video) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         Theres a timer at the back of the device 
                         youre wearing. When the timer goes 
                         off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open.
 
               In the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives 
               talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk. 
               He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen. Tapp stops and rewinds 
               the tape.
 
                                     SING
                         (to the other detectives leaving) Ill 
                         catch you guys down there. (he reaches 
                         over and gets something off of his desk)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from video) Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap.
 
               Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.

                                     JIGSAW
                         (from video) Ill show you...

               Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the 
               device going off and exploding. Sing watches too, not paying 
               as close attention. As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks. The 
               look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing 
               concern for his partners obsession over this case.
 
                                     SING
                         Hey Tapp?

               Tapp doesnt look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene 
               when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he 
               was working on his paper.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Mmm?

                                     SING
                         Were gonna go down to the Grill, go 
                         get a beer. You wanna come?
 
                                     TAPP
                         I dont think so. Thanks anyway.

                                     SING
                         (Figured he might answer as such) You 
                         know I always ask. (He puts on his jacket)

                                     SING
                         Ill leave you to have fun up here. 
                         (He puts his hands on his hips, watching 
                         some more of the video.)

                         (on video) Its in the stomach of your

                                     SING
                         (still trying to reach him, break him 
                         from his obsession groove) Hey Tapp? 
                         I dont mean for this to be disrespectful...(pause) 
                         Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
 
                         
               Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a 
               bit too, but doesnt look up. Sing remains grinning a bit. But 
               then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) Its in the stomach of your 
                         dead cellmate.
 
               Tapp fast forwards.

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on video) Look around, Amanda. Know 
                         that Im not lying. (Sing steps off 
                         to the right) You better hurry up. (Tapp 
                         rewinds again, suddenly pauses)
 
                                     TAPP
                         Wait wait wait, Sing!

               Sing stops, turns.

                                     TAPP
                         Get back here!

                                     SING
                         What?

                                     TAPP
                         Mmm! (he gestures franticly for him 
                         to come over.)
 
                                     SING
                         (sighs then comes over) What?

               Tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen 
               to a grafittied wall on the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Remember 118th Street?

                                     SING
                         (looks at the screen, thinks a minute) 
                         Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was 
                         only about four blocks.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Now listen to this.

               They listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound 
               of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They 
               look at each other. Tapp hits stop.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looking up at Sing) We gotta check 
                         the records from all the fire emergencies 
                         that occurred there in the last two 
                         weeks. Go, right now! Mmm!
 
               Sing turns and quickly walks off.

                                     CUT TO
                         Close up of a map, with Sing speaking 
                         in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres 
                         a brief shot of the two of them sitting 
                         over the map, then quick shots of a 
                         few black and white photographs of a 
                         warehouse, including a close up of a 
                         street sign Stygian St.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO) On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, 
                         we got a fire alarm going off in the 
                         rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. Its 
                         an old listing. Used to be a mannequin 
                         factory. (cut back to view of the two 
                         detectives) You think we have enough 
                         for a warrant, though?
 
                                     TAPP
                         Who said anything about a warrant? (He 
                         grins, gets up and grabs his jacket.)
 
                         
                                     SING
                         (are you serious?) Right now?

                                     TAPP
                         Why not?

                                     SING
                         Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps 
                         a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, 
                         and quickly follows Tapp.
 
               Brief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud static, 
               which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse 
               building and a car speeding by. Our view is from inside the car 
               as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be 
               heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded 
               and cocked.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (VO) At least well have the cover of 
                         darkness.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
 
                         
               A shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled 
               up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside 
               of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, 
               sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding 
               out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up 
               to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Pauls 
               razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, 
               Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another 
               level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points 
               over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous 
               items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti 
               from the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I got you...

               They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link 
               fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part 
               of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp 
               goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered 
               in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls 
               back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom 
               scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, 
               dolls representing each of them.
 
                                     TAPP
                         What the hell is this?.......(his voice 
                         almost a whisper) Oh shit...
 
               They move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth 
               covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amandas 
               video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, 
               boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we 
               have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that 
               Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at 
               the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move 
               and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives.
 
               
                                     SING
                         Oh fuck!

               They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one 
               end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied 
               to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a 
               manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two 
               power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed 
               directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his 
               tape at the detectives.
 
               Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of 
               the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns 
               ready.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looks to Sing, says softly) Wait Sing!
 
                         
                                     SING
                         (trying to keep his voice low but coming 
                         off a bit loudly) What?
 
                                     TAPP
                         (eager) Lets see what hes gonna do.
 
                         
                                     SING
                         Why? Weve fucking got him.

               Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get 
               a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         We dont know what he looks like. Lets 
                         see what hes gonna do.
 
                                     SING
                         (rather loudly, again) No fucking way!
 
                         
               As the two argue, the man in the chair continues to protest his 
               position.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, Sing! (he moves in front of the 
                         man a bit, holding up his hand to try 
                         to halt Sing, trying to convince him 
                         to go along with him.)
 
                                     SING
                         (isnt buying into it) Fuck that. Im 
                         gonna take him.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing!

                                     SING
                         What the fuck? Shit!

                                     TAPP
                         Wait Sing, listen.

               Whoever it is is moving closer, so they quickly cover up the 
               man and the other things they uncovered. The man in the chair 
               protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can 
               in his chair. Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering 
               the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined 
               in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the 
               figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps 
               to the man in the chair. The figures hood is up; we do not see 
               his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat 
               difficult time with it.
 
               He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through 
               the gag. When the figure speaks, we instantly know it is Jigsaw; 
               it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the video.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful 
                         tranquilizers next time. (Jeff continues 
                         his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw 
                         reaches over and touches his shoulder) 
                         Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. 
                         Youre a test subject for something 
                         greater than yourself.
 
               Thats when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move 
               out of their hiding spot, aiming their weapons at Jigsaw.
 
                                     SING
                         Freeze! Police!

                                     TAPP
                         Hold it right there! Dont move!

                                     SING
                         Put your fucking hands in the air!
 
                         
               Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but 
               then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and 
               the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life. He remains with 
               his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Now youll make a choice. (Sing runs 
                         up the steps to try to where Jigsaw 
                         is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where 
                         he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life 
                         of this man will be ended.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here!

                                     SING
                         (keeping his gun steadily aimed) What 
                         did you do? Turn it off!
 
               Jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills 
               come closer.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this 
                         bastard down. (Sing tosses Tapp the 
                         shotgun.) Move!
 
                                     SING
                         (to Jigsaw) How do you turn it off?!
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him how to stop it!

               Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs.

                                     JIGSAW
                         One key will unlock it.

                                     SING
                         (frantic) Where is it?!

                                     JIGSAW
                         Its in the box.

                                     SING
                         Box! (He sees a box on the side of the 
                         chair and opens it. Inside he pulls 
                         out a ring of at least 30 keys, and 
                         goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock 
                         the device. He tries a couple of keys, 
                         none working.) Fuck! Which key, which 
                         key?!
 
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him which key it is!

                                     JIGSAW
                         (now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. 
                         His back is to us, we still dont see 
                         his face.) Time is running out.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here right now, 
                         asshole!
 
               Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.

                                     JIGSAW
                         Whats more important to you Officer, 
                         arresting me or the life of another 
                         human being?
 
               Sing keeps trying various keys. Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs 
               him, pushing him down to his knees. Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly 
               raised.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Get down on your knees!

                                     SING
                         Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!

                                     TAPP
                         (gun aimed at the back of Jigsaws head) 
                         Hands behind your head! (Jigsaw obliges) 
                         Sick bastard.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Yes, I am sick, Officer.

                                     SING
                         (still trying various keys, none working. 
                         Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes 
                         his eyes, crying, as the drills are 
                         only 2 inches away) Tapp! Its like, 
                         theres a hundred keys in here!
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Sick from the disease eating away at 
                         me inside. Sick of people who dont 
                         appreciate their blessings. Sick of 
                         those who scoff at the suffering of 
                         others.
 
               Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking 
               and stopping them. Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted 
               by the gunfire.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (as he pops a blade out of a wristband 
                         hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of 
                         it all! (He lashes upwards, slashing 
                         Tapps throat)
 
                                     SING
                         (seeing the throat slash) Tapp!!! (runs 
                         down from Jeff towards them. Tapp clutches 
                         his throat, completely surprised, gurgling.)
 
                         
               Jigsaw RUNS, fast as he can, out of the room. Sing takes a couple 
               of shots at him and misses. He stops when he reaches Tapp, who 
               is slumped against the fence/wall and bends down next to him.
 
               
                                     SING
                         (desperate, a trace of despair) No, 
                         no! Tapp! Shit!
 
               Tapp gurgles at him, hands him the shotgun.

                                     SING
                         (standing, touching Tapp on the shoulder 
                         then head) Ill be back, okay? Ill 
                         be back.
 
               Tapp just kind of nods, gurgling and holding his throat. Sing 
               spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the warehouse, 
               out of the room and down a flight of stairs. He moves down a 
               long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. 
               He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes 
               another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. 
               Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. 
               He drags himself along the floor.
 
               Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs 
               very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself 
               facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to 
               get away. He takes aim.
 
                                     SING
                         (shouting) Freeze or Ill shoot!

               Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes 
               down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw 
               doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly 
               move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles 
               to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing.
 
               Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway 
               down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over 
               it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and 
               steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun 
               with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, 
               and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down 
               directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against 
               him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms 
               for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who 
               is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs 
               just before the hallway where Sing now is.
 
               On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. 
               We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving 
               and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further 
               down the hall. Sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, 
               spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against 
               the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end 
               of the hall and starts sliding a large door open.
 
               At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns 
               into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on 
               the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go 
               left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees 
               Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes 
               the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his 
               mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping 
               coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and 
               then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including 
               a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now 
               missing.
 
               At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, 
               sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar 
               across his neck.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (weak, desperate) Had you...had you 
                         on your knees. (He sits forward, getting 
                         some things off the coffee table) Youre 
                         running. Youre running...(He gets up 
                         and goes over to the desk in the corner 
                         with the audio recording device and 
                         dozens of photos pinned to the wall, 
                         takes a seat) Youre running scared 
                         because we had you. Im going to close 
                         this case. Ram close it. (He picks up 
                         a small framed photograph, which we 
                         cant see, but likely, its of Sing.) 
                         Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close 
                         it, Sing.

                         X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching 
                         the pipe and looking up and around a 
                         bit.) X marks the spot...we need to 
                         search this room again. (He turns and 
                         looks over at Adam.) What are you doing 
                         over there?
 
               Cut back into regular view in the bathroom, with a shot of Adam 
               sitting on the tub, holding the photograph of Alison and Diana 
               just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub, looking down 
               at it. He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over.

                         because Im stuck in this room with 
                         you doesnt mean I have to report to

                         in us not helping one another.
 
                                     ADAM
                         well what do you want me to do? Im 
                         on a leash.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats exactly why we need to talk. 
                         We need to think!
 
                                     ADAM
                         I am thinking!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snapping at him) Well then dont keep 
                         me in the dark about what youre thinking!
 
                         
               There is a pause as something about that statement strikes Adam.
 
               
                                     ADAM

                         as he stands) Turn them off now, please!

                         (impatiently) Just turn them off for 
                         a second!
 
               Lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards, reaching over 
               and flipping off the lights. Adam looks around. Lawrence looks 
               around too, but he sees nothing. He doesnt seem to think this 
               is going to help any. Then we see on the wall next to him a glow 
               in the dark X painted on the tiles. He doesnt see it and shrugs, 
               but Adam spots it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Jesus, behind you!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns and sees it, is surprised) How 
                         come we didnt see that before?
 
                                     ADAM
                         The lights in here hadnt charged it. 
                         It must be glow in the dark paint or 
                         something.
 
               Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing 
               slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, 
               though not as much as before. Lawrence leans over and picks up 
               his hacksaw, going over to the tiles where the X is and starts 
               hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw. He breaks through, 
               reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small 
               brown box with a hinged lid. He cant believe it. He looks to 
               Adam, a small grin on his face. He places it on the floor and 
               sits down behind it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (excitedly) Open it!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns it around so we and Adam can 
                         see the small lock on it.) Its locked. 
                         (He pauses, thinking, then realizes 
                         something) The key, the one from my 
                         envelope. Where is it?
 
               Adam looks around him, then leans down, looking on the floor 
               for the key.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (soft, hushed tone as he looks) Where 
                         the fuck...Here. (He finds it, picks 
                         it up and tosses it over.)
 
               Lawrence picks up the key, tries it on the lock. It works. He 
               takes the lock off, opens the box. He holds up a cell phone, 
               smiling in relief.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (big smile) Cell phone. The most beautiful 
                         invention on this planet!
 
               Lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes. Adam lets 
               out a joyful laugh.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Make that second most beautiful invention! 
                         (He reaches out his hand for Lawrence 
                         to toss it.) Give me that.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Are you joking? Youre gonna put something 
                         we found in this room in your mouth?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pause, then) Yes, Im willing to risk 
                         it! Give me that sweet cancer. (Lawrence 
                         ignores his request, tosses out the 
                         other cigarette and a lighter. He finds 
                         lastly a small folded up note with the 
                         words Shh, Doctor, written on it.) I 
                         dont care, I really dont. Give me 
                         one of those.
 
               Jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as Lawrence 
               opens the paper and reads it, keeping it low in the box where 
               Adam cant see it.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) The cigarettes are harmless, I 
                         promise. Smoking is only poisonous when 
                         it ends in bloodshed. Think about this 
                         - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (growing impatient) May I please have 
                         a cigarette?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (ignoring his plea) Im trying the police. 
                         (He flips open and dials on the cell 
                         phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating 
                         the call cant go through comes from 
                         the phone. He dials again, same result.) 
                         Shit. (Pause, thinks.) This was meant 
                         to receive calls, not make them. (A 
                         moment; he realizes something.) Wait 
                         a minute...this has happened before.
 
                         
               Cut back to an overhead descending view inside a parking garage.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) Last night, after I finished at 
                         the hospital. (fade into another closer 
                         shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking 
                         down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.) 
                         I was walking back to my car. (He stops 
                         a moment) I thought I was alone, but 
                         Im sure someone else was there. (He 
                         squints, bringing his hand up over his 
                         eyes. There is a flash from the side. 
                         He looks up, startled, looking in the 
                         direction in which he thinks it came 
                         from, but sees nothing. He looks around 
                         him for another moment, then continues 
                         forward to his car.)
 
               Cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of Lawrences 
               car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station. He gets 
               out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on 
               the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, 
               it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot 
               of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side 
               starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, 
               aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He 
               opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get 
               out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and 
               has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence 
               finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the 
               same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that 
               he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, 
               trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves 
               even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing 
               the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaws 
               workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with 
               his phone and grabs him.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still 
               holding the phone.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His eyes distant, off in his memory) 
                         That...thing. It was waiting for me. 
                         (He exhales sharply, then looks back 
                         up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, 
                         staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. 
                         With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses 
                         him.) How did you know to turn off the 
                         lights?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who cares? It worked.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah, but how did you know?

                                     ADAM
                         (a slight pause) Instinct. (His tone 
                         is far from believable.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt believe a word of it) Instinct?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You know what? (he looks down, then 
                         back up at Adam.) Youre a terrible 
                         liar.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (quiet offense) You say that like you 
                         know me.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaks calmly, but anger lies underneath 
                         the surface) What else arent you telling 
                         me?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (cocky and sarcastic) Well, um, lets 
                         see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend 
                         at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me 
                         with a rusty nail. I didnt tell you 
                         about that. I didnt tell you that 
                         my last girlfriend, (Lawrence lowers 
                         his head into his hands. Un-FUCKING-believable) 
                         who was a feminist vegan punk, broke 
                         up with me because she thought I was 
                         too angry. Uh, I havent told you that 
                         one of my toenails is slightly...
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps at him, fed up) Just stop it. 
                         You knew to turn off these lights.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (turning away from Lawrence) What-ever.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (stands up, frustrated.) Im dealing 
                         with a juvenile.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (has had it, looks right at him) You 
                         wanna know?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (exasperated) Yeah!

               Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds 
               up the picture of Alison and Diana.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (with a somewhat aggressive attitude) 
                         Here it is. (He throws it towards Lawrence, 
                         who looks down at it, then back up at 
                         Adam before getting down on the floor 
                         and pulling it towards him with the 
                         hinged box. He picks it up, sitting 
                         up as he looks upon it with shock. )
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very softly, shakily) Oh God...(he 
                         turns it over, then back. Adam casts 
                         his eyes downwards, still standing but 
                         cooling off, feeling bad for Lawrence) 
                         W...where did you get this?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) It was in your wallet, behind 
                         the photo of your daughter.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...why didnt you show me this before?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I couldnt. (Lawrence begins to shakily 
                         sob, touching the photo.) Im sorry. 
                         (Adam goes over and sits against a pipe 
                         in his corner, lowering his head and 
                         upper body forward, holding his head 
                         in his hands.)
 
               Lawrence sniffles, shaking, then looks right to the surveillance 
               camera behind the glass and screams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What are you doing to them you bastard?! 
                         (He goes back to huddling over the photograph, 
                         sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, 
                         he sits up, trying to pull himself together) 
                         Okay...okay..(he looks around a bit) 
                         Okay, Ive got to think now...(He looks 
                         down, sees the note again in the box.)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) Think about this...you dont need 
                         a gun to kill Adam. When theres that 
                         much poison in your blood (a slow shot 
                         moving to the pool of blood from the 
                         body in front of Lawrence), the only 
                         thing left to do is shoot yourself.
 
                         
               Lawrence looks at the body, then down. Hes getting an idea. 
               He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his 
               head down in his hands. He dips the end of the cigarette in the 
               blood, then puts it back in the box. He starts to get up. Adam 
               looks up, sees him standing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you doing?

               Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips 
               off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights 
               go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Hey! What the hell are you doing?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (whispering so the surveillance camera 
                         will not pick him up) Adam, listen to 
                         me. I want you to play along with me 
                         on this.
 
               Zep leans in, trying to hear whats being said, but the static 
               of the video is too loud. He tries to adjust the sound, but to 
               no avail. Shot goes back into the bathroom, where Lawrence is 
               finishing saying something to Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You got that? (he turns the lights back 
                         on, both of them again wincing at the 
                         bright light. Lawrence glances at the 
                         surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to be nonchalant) So you uh, 
                         still want that cigarette?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Um...yeah, sure.

               Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned 
               cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws 
               it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. 
               Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette 
               between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He 
               glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just 
               shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in 
               a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then 
               suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound 
               coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of 
               his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and 
               goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, 
               almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder 
               as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held 
               out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the 
               floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long 
               cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death 
               in its entirety is very, very fake.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watches Adam, then turns to the surveillance 
                         camera, speaks with angry finality) 
                         There! Ive done it! Ive killed him 
                         with the poison, just like you wanted. 
                         (shouting) Now wheres my family?! Where 
                         are they?!
 
               Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical 
               buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries 
               out. He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted, and Lawrence 
               looks upon him in shock. Finally, the electrocution stops, and 
               Adam sits up slightly, gasping, eyes wide.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus 
                         Christ!!
 
               Lawrences reaction is not one of concern; he simply cant believe 
               that Adam just screwed up the plan.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief) What?

                                     ADAM
                         (wide eyed) I just got electrocuted!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. 
                         He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was 
                         our way out!
 
               Adam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think 
               hed make something like that up.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (yelling at him) Did you hear what I 
                         said? (he desperately grabs at the manacle 
                         around his ankle, pulling at it and 
                         shrieking) Get this thing off me! Get 
                         it off!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissed off) Stop acting!

                                     ADAM
                         (stops pulling at the manacle and chains; 
                         now hes pissed at Lawrence for his 
                         disbelief) You think I would make that 
                         up just to mess up your stupid fucking 
                         charade?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (gives up on Adam, frustrated once more) 
                         All right, thats it! (He leans over 
                         and picks up his saw, sits down and 
                         starts trying to saw through his chains 
                         again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, 
                         just sits back against the wall, breathing 
                         heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues 
                         to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. 
                         He gets pissed off and throws the blade 
                         down.) Ah, Damn it!!
 
               Back to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization 
               dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (wide-eyed) I remember everything now. 
                         (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember 
                         how I got here.
 
               Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, 
               a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to 
               music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. 
               He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway 
               to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him 
               then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the 
               table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, 
               decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described 
               it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper 
               is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty.
 
               Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, 
               then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing 
               the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera 
               down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, 
               takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts 
               them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to 
               a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, 
               ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. 
               It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact 
               Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the 
               parking garage with his hand over his eyes.
 
               The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole 
               in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing 
               the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to 
               black, industrial music playing over the shot.
 
               Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head 
               down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt 
               meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why 
               all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of 
               sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. 
               He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another 
               aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the 
               counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. Pissed, he 
               shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt 
               work. He looks at it, scoffs.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Great.

               Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere 
               in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks 
               up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out 
               in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black 
               apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but 
               trying to be brave.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Is someone there? (he takes a picture, 
                         the flash lighting up the area in front 
                         of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another 
                         picture, the flash lighting up a living 
                         room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward 
                         more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping 
                         away for light.)
 
               Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard. He startles, 
               spinning around.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (his voice alarmed but confused at the 
                         same time) What the...? (He snaps a 
                         picture in its direction and sees the 
                         Puppet from Jigsaws workshop and video 
                         sitting in an armchair, continuing its 
                         evil laugh.) Christ! (He reaches down 
                         and finds a baseball bat on the floor, 
                         and starts hitting the doll as hard 
                         as he can until the laugh starts to 
                         fade and then just dies out. ) What 
                         the...
 
               He hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind 
               him in a closet. He goes on alert again, holding up the baseball 
               bat and the camera.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who is that?! Whos in there?! (he moves 
                         towards the door, shaking but trying 
                         to be a tough guy) Come on out! Ill 
                         kill you, you motherfucker! (He opens 
                         the door, holds the camera and takes 
                         a picture. As soon as the flash goes 
                         off we see the red-robed pig thing that 
                         originally grabbed Lawrence quickly 
                         move forward and grab Adam.)
 
               Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in 
               slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as 
               well. Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully reaches 
               down, picks it up and answers it. The scene will cut back and 
               forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on the phone 
               for the duration of the conversation.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not sure what to expect) Who is this?
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (on the phone, sobbing) Daddy?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Diana? (he stands)

                                     DIANA
                         Daddy, is that you? (cut to a shot of 
                         her being held by Zep, the phone to 
                         her ear.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting sniffly) Yeah baby, its me. 
                         Im here. (Adam watches him intently)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (sobbing) Im scared, Daddy.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying his best to reassure her) Dont 
                         worry honey, everythings going to be 
                         okay. Wheres Mommy?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Shes here with me.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Staying as calm and collected as he 
                         can for his daughter) Let me talk to 
                         her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.
 
                                     DIANA
                         The bad man from my room is here. He 
                         has us tied up and he has a gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...what man?

                                     DIANA
                         Please come home Daddy! (Zep kisses 
                         her on the top of her head and takes 
                         the phone away to give to Alison.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hello? Hello? Diana?

               Zep pushes some of Alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel 
               of the gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (desperate) Diana! Diana!

               Zep puts the phone up to Alisons ear.

                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of 
                         Alison giving a threatening look through 
                         her tears to Zep.)
 
                                     ALISON
                         Is Adam there?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (surprised, looks to Adam, who continues 
                         to watch him worriedly) How do you know? 
                         Ally, what is going on?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (through her sobs, trying to calm them 
                         and get this message to him) Dont believe 
                         Adams lies. He knows you. He knew all 
                         about you before today. (Zep quickly 
                         takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut 
                         back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the 
                         phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a dial tone is heard from the other 
                         end hanging up. Lawrence is desperate) 
                         Hello? Ally? Ally? (No answer, just 
                         the dial tone. He stands up.) Hello? 
                         (He looks to the surveillance camera, 
                         screaming) God damn you! If you so much 
                         as lay a finger on them, Ill kill you! 
                         You hear me? You son of a bitch! Ill 
                         kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward 
                         over the floor, crying a bit. He slams 
                         his fist fiercely against the floor.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (quietly, as though cautiously approaching 
                         a dangerous animal) Are they okay?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up. His voice is calmer, but rage 
                         is clearly underneath the surface) My 
                         wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (a brief Oh shit look appears in his 
                         eyes, but he acts surprised) What did 
                         she say?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not looking at him yet. Speaks very 
                         firmly, trying to suppress his rage.) 
                         She told me...not to believe you.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (cannot even look at Lawrence.) Believe 
                         me about what? (There is no doubt hes 
                         hiding something)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Finally turns to look at him, the look 
                         of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew 
                         me. (He stands, looming menacingly, 
                         the look stronger on his face) Who are 
                         you?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (still trying to cover up and losing, 
                         still not making eye contact) You know 
                         who I am.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps, shouting at him) Stop the lies! 
                         Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (His tone changes, hes had it with 
                         hiding, had it with Lawrence) Im a 
                         liar? (Finally, he looks up, right at 
                         Lawrence. His voice is firm and accusing.) 
                         What did you do last night, Lawrence? 
                         Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? 
                         You told me that after you left your 
                         house last night, you went to work at 
                         a hospital.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (defensively) Thats because its the 
                         truth.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (almost deadly) No its not. Your wife 
                         is right, Larry. (Lawrence is now the 
                         one wearing the Oh shit look.) You dont 
                         recall getting your picture taken in 
                         that parking lot?
 
               Brief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage, pausing 
               and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed. We 
               see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the shot from 
               around a corner, ducking back behind the column. Lawrence looks 
               up at the flash, startled.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam stands up, his stance and body 
               language accusing of Lawrence. He speaks fiercely, disgusted 
               with Lawrences two-faced bullshit.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I can prove that you didnt go anywhere 
                         near a hospital last night. (He leans 
                         over and pulls out the garbage bag from 
                         the tub. Lawrence stands, staring at 
                         him in near disbelief. He has been caught. 
                         Adam takes a handful of photos from 
                         the baggie hed kept hidden inside the 
                         garbage bag, holds them up and throws 
                         them down, scattering them.) Its not 
                         the first time Ive done it either, 
                         Larry. (Lawrence leans over to look 
                         at the photos on the floor in front 
                         of him with complete and utter disbelief, 
                         picking one up and looking down at it) 
                         Ive been taking pictures of you for 
                         a few days now. (Shots of some of Adams 
                         pictures. Lawrence going into a building, 
                         Lawrence at an outdoor café eating lunch.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (still holding the photograph) But...why?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         You wanna know what I do? I get paid 
                         to take pictures of rich guys like you 
                         who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels 
                         to fuck their secretaries. (we start 
                         seeing more shots Adam took while following 
                         Lawrence) Last night I went to your 
                         house. (Flashback of Adam holding his 
                         camera, then cut to several photographs 
                         of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing 
                         over his shoulder and moving down the 
                         sidewalk) I watched you leave. I followed 
                         you (Lawrence in the parking garage, 
                         photographs of the exterior of the Hotel 
                         Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking 
                         on the door to one of the rooms while 
                         Adam hides around the corner with his 
                         camera) all the way to that shitbag 
                         hotel. (Photographs of Lawrence standing 
                         outside then going into the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calm with rage just beneath the surface) 
                         Youve uh, had these with you the whole 
                         time?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I found them, in there (points to the 
                         toilet; quick flashback of Adam pulling 
                         the bag out of the top of the toilet, 
                         then Adam opening the bag and seeing 
                         the hacksaws and a glimpse of something 
                         else in the bag.) with the hacksaws. 
                         (Flashback of Adam tossing the bag into 
                         the bathtub while Lawrence isnt looking.) 
                         I dont know how they got there.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (angry) Yeah, right. Youre so full 
                         of it! (He angrily crumples up and throws 
                         the photo he was holding at Adam)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (scoffing tone) Aww, face it, Larry, 
                         were both bulls hitters. But my camera 
                         isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It 
                         only shows you whats put right in front 
                         of it. Just out of curiosity, what did 
                         you do in that motel room? You got out 
                         of there pretty fast.
 
               Cut to a flashback, the hotel room. Carla, the pretty Asian girl 
               from the hospital, is inside the room, now in a black lacy top 
               and a gray/blue skirt, waiting for him. She opens the door, taking 
               a step back as he enters. He looks unsure of the whole situation, 
               a changed attitude this evening from all the others. He shuts 
               the door behind him, and Carla smiles at him. Lawrences tone 
               when he speaks is unhappy. Not enraged, just somewhat disapproving.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Why did you um, deem it necessary to 
                         page me when you knew I was at home?
 
                         
                                     CARLA
                         I didnt know if you were going to make 
                         it. (turns, goes and sits on the bed.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounding very business-like) But I 
                         gave you a precise time at which to 
                         page me. (He puts the briefcase on a 
                         chair by the door then goes over and 
                         sits down next to her on the bed.) You 
                         cant do that.
 
                                     CARLA
                         Its not like I know the rules for this 
                         sort of stuff. (She starts unbuttoning 
                         her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand 
                         and stops her. She looks up at him, 
                         concerned.) Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a sigh in his voice) Look, it was wrong 
                         for me to makes you come here.
 
                                     CARLA
                         (confused, hurt) But I thought we-
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         -Please. (very softly) Im sorry. (He 
                         stands and heads over to the door. Carla 
                         remains sitting on the bed. She sniffles 
                         slightly but doesnt cry.)
 
               Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings. Carla and Lawrence both 
               look at it, unsure, startled. Carla looks to Lawrence.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You tell anyone you were here?

                                     CARLA
                         No. (She stands, goes over to the phone 
                         and answers it.) Hello? (She listens, 
                         turns to Lawrence) Its for you. (She 
                         holds out the phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         For me? (He walks over, takes the phone.) 
                         Hello?
 
               The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy. It is unidentifiable; 
               it could be either Tapp or Zep, or someone else. It is very accusing.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         I know what youre doing...Doctor.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I- (but the other person hangs up, and 
                         a dial tone is heard)
 
               Lawrence hangs up the phone, turns and moves to the door. Carla 
               moves with him, watching, waiting for him to say who it was.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nervous) I have to go.

                                     CARLA
                         What happened?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase 
                         from the chair, and heads out the door.
 
                         
               Cut to the underground parking lot, the same shot as where Adam 
               took Lawrences picture. He walks along, pauses to wince and 
               cover his eyes, then the flash. He looks up startled.
 
               The shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against the wall 
               in his corner, hand against a pipe. He slowly looks up at Adam, 
               thinking of something.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Who was it?

                                     ADAM
                         Who was what?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         The person who paid you to follow me, 
                         who was it?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) He calls himself Bob 
                         and he gives me the money up front. 
                         Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have 
                         known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve 
                         asked for a hell of a lot more.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissy) What does that mean? Does that 
                         mean you saw what happened to me?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (internal eye roll; speaks as though 
                         hes been over this 100 times before) 
                         What I saw was you get into your car. 
                         Thats it. I didnt ask your name. I 
                         didnt know who you were. I dont know 
                         how I got here, I dont know how you 
                         got here. I just took the shots (As 
                         he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam 
                         taking a picture, going up apartment 
                         stairs, then in the darkroom) and went 
                         straight home to develop the. Next thing 
                         I know Im chained to a pipe in some 
                         prehistoric bathroom, staring at the 
                         guy Ive been taking shots of all night.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (seeing a major break in this mystery) 
                         Clearly, whoever paid you to take the 
                         pictures of me is the one who put is 
                         in here.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (they dont know that for sure) Maybe.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course 
                         it is! What did he look like?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) I dont know, he was 
                         just a guy. (Shot of inside Adams apartment 
                         and an unidentifiable figure towards 
                         the back of the room, the image darkened 
                         so we cant make him out. The figure 
                         slowly takes a step towards us/Adam)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I dont take notes about his appearance. 
                         (Shot inside apartment, the figure moves 
                         closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (aggravated, how can he not remember 
                         anything?) You must remember something 
                         about him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I cant. (Shot of inside the apartment, 
                         the figure moves closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre telling me you dont remember 
                         a thing about the guy?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you, I- (inside apartment, the 
                         figure moves closer, just about close 
                         enough for identification)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (enraged, throwing his hands up) Oh 
                         for fucks sake! I give up!
 
                                     ADAM
                         (gives up his playing dumb tone, gives 
                         in due to irritation with Lawrence) 
                         Hes a tall black guy, hes got a scar 
                         around his neck, okay? (Shot of inside 
                         the apartment, the figure moves into 
                         a viewable light; It is Tapp.)
 
               Lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from Adam. At 
               hearing Adams description, he slowly moves back, turns around 
               to face Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tapp! (shot of inside Adams apartment, 
                         Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our 
                         hand reaches out and takes it quickly. 
                         Then, back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these 
                         photos was not a cop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No, no, he was discharged from the police 
                         force. (Shot of Tapp at his desk with 
                         the Amanda video, looking at notes.) 
                         He broke down after his partner was 
                         killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to 
                         each other in Lawrences office), but 
                         that didnt stop him from harassing 
                         me. (Lawrence sitting in the car next 
                         to Tapp) The guy became obsessed. (Tapp 
                         in his current apartment adjusting the 
                         camera in the window, then a shot of 
                         him leaning over a notebook, going over 
                         notes.) Hes convinced himself that 
                         I must have somehow been involved with 
                         the murders. Hes...hes crazy. (Tapp 
                         at the corner desk in his apartment, 
                         giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh 
                         laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, 
                         who points accusingly at Adam.) And 
                         you helped him. (disgusted) You took 
                         money from him to invade my privacy. 
                         How could you do that?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (bite me tone) Call it my need to eat.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sarcastic) Right, right. You know what 
                         Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, 
                         youre a part of it. (Points accusingly 
                         at him as he says this.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks 
                         youre the one behind it all.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Facing into the corner of his cell, 
                         turning around slightly, internal eye 
                         roll.) I told you, hes not a cop. Hes 
                         a bottom feeder, just like you. (A slight 
                         sneer from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence 
                         turns back into his corner)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (getting REALLY pissed at Lawrences 
                         attitude towards him) What are you more 
                         pissed off about? The fact that I took 
                         some shots of you or the fact that I 
                         took some shots of you while you were 
                         cheating on your wife?
 
               Lawrence spins out of his corner, screaming in rage.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         I did not cheat on her!!!

                                     ADAM
                         What do you care what I think anyway? 
                         I dont give a crap if you covered yourself 
                         in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker 
                         gang bang!
 
               A pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. Hes lost the 
               last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits 
                         down on the pipe in his corner, leaning 
                         forward a bit.) I had...I had everything 
                         in order. (he lays down on his side, 
                         facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) 
                         My whole life was in perfect order. 
                         (He holds up and looks at the picture 
                         of Alison and Diana gagged.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons Bedroom. Zep puts Alisons gag back on her, 
               then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen 
               the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she 
               speaks softly to Diana.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes 
                         her head no) Mommy just needs you to 
                         be really, really, really strong right 
                         now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt 
                         you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, 
                         thats my good girl. (She starts crying 
                         as her hands work behind her to loosen 
                         the rope around them.)
 
               Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his 
               position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, 
               notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow 
               and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking 
               it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts 
               to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance 
               camera, sitting on the floor. Adams next line is a voice over 
               over this shot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Hey, was there someone else at your 
                         house last night besides your wife and 
                         daughter?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (on camera) No.

                                     ADAM
                         (still on camera) Well, theres someone 
                         here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, 
                         whosits up, picks it up and looks at 
                         it. After a moment, the shot cuts back 
                         to a regular view of them, in the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (realization) I know him. (We see the 
                         photo as well. It is a shot looking 
                         up into Lawrences window, with Zep 
                         standing there, looking out, completely 
                         unaware of his picture being taken.) 
                         Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. 
                         The shot goes back and forth between 
                         him as his eyes widen while Lawrence 
                         makes his threats.) His name is Zep. 
                         Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his 
                         voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. 
                         You perverted little psychopath. Im 
                         gonna take great pleasure in seeing 
                         you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
 
                         
               Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with 
               a very worried look. He points up to it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from 
                         his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads 
                         at 6:00.) Were out of time.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (crying) Mommy help me!

               Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his 
               chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving 
               near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly 
               replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position 
               with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep 
               steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows 
               slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to 
               just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and 
               leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes 
               his head sadly. He speaks calmly.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta 
                         do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid 
                         it has to be you that tells him he failed. 
                         (He undoes her gag, holds the phone 
                         to her head and his gun in front of 
                         her chest.)
 
               Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at 
               the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone 
               rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaking quickly, the growling voice) 
                         Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam 
                         gets up from his corner, moves forward 
                         slightly) I know its you, you son of 
                         a bitch!
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced 
                         with worry) Ally?
 
               Cut into the bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         (looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed.
 
                         
               Quickly, she grabs Zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her 
               left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (who can only hear the sound of a struggle) 
                         Hello? Hello?
 
               Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an 
               stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, 
               trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed 
               at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one 
               thought right now is Fuck.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont move, stay on the ground. Give 
                         me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits 
                         up a bit, carefully slides it to her. 
                         He is watching her, looking for an opportunity 
                         to overcome her once again. She picks 
                         the phone up, still keeping her eyes 
                         and her gun at him.) Larry?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally! Honey, are you all right?

                                     ALISON
                         No! No were not...(Zep starts to move 
                         up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning 
                         against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens 
                         him more fiercely with the gun.) Get 
                         down! Larry, where are you?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (unsure himself) I dont know. Im being 
                         held captive in a room somewhere.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (disbelief; she sniffles a bit) What? 
                         What are you talking about?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (starting to cry) Im so sorry, Ally.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (desperate) Honey, we need you here. 
                         (Zep slowly readies himself to move 
                         forward, wide eyes still staring at 
                         Alison.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (crying, apologizing) Im sorry for 
                         everything. Its my fault. Please forgive 
                         me. Ive always been happy with you.
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (cries out) Mommy!

               Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes 
               the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and 
               they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, 
               on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In 
               wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues 
               to scream.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (panicked) Ally!

               Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up 
               to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window.
 
               
               Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep 
               manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, 
               but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a 
               shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the 
               flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun 
               and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, 
               we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep 
               gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and 
               the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screams) Ally! (Adam watches him with 
                         wide eyes.)
 
               The shot cuts back into the bedroom.

                                     DIANA
                         Mommy, help me!

               The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun 
               in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly 
               pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. 
               She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. 
               He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching 
               his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes 
               over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the 
               residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with 
               his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on 
               the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Freeze!

               Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt 
               hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches 
               the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, 
               hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing 
               forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can 
               only imagine what hes hearing.
 
               Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column 
               and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana 
               and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. 
               Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana 
               run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck?
 
                         
               Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on 
               his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking 
               him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him 
               from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still 
               on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand.
 
               
               Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase 
               on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow 
               stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his 
               gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. 
               He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.
 
               
                                     ZEP
                         Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out 
                         of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! 
                         (His breathing is fast, desperate. He 
                         clutches the wound on his leg.) Im 
                         gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. 
                         (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles 
                         over to the computer station, taking 
                         keys from the desk and then hobbling 
                         down the hall and out the door. We see 
                         Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep 
                         glances over and sees Tapp get to his 
                         feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway 
                         and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, 
                         just a we bit dazed from the hit. He 
                         empties his gun cartridge and replaces 
                         it, then runs towards the door, screaming.
 
                         
               Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just 
               a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there 
               is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung 
               onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he 
               starts to panic.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes 
                         out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution 
                         continues, and then a moment later stops. 
                         Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence 
                         is out.) Lawrence, get up!
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with 
                         Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They 
                         race through the streets as fast as 
                         they can.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what 
               to do, panicking. Lawrence cant be dead, he cant be alone in 
               here. He cant handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected 
               Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! 
                         Get up! I need you! (He leans down and 
                         finds a piece of debris on the floor, 
                         throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit 
                         him. He leans down, picks up another, 
                         throws it. This one bounces onto the 
                         floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, 
                         who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence 
                         starts to move more, reaching for his 
                         head and sitting up. Adam cries out 
                         in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought 
                         you were dead!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he 
                         electrocuted me...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you! The same thing happened 
                         to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?
 
               Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. 
               Suddenly, he snaps.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!!

               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle 
               with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly 
               moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the 
               floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it.
 
               
               In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front 
               of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing 
               down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears 
               him and follows the sound down the hall.
 
               In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the 
               hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone 
               with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He 
               tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the 
               box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing 
               what to do.
 
               Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning 
               from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off 
               further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving 
               in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, 
               he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. 
               Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp 
               ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He 
               leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains 
               standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns 
               and quickly hobbles further down the hall.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone 
               as it keeps ringing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries 
                         loudly.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (Frightened but trying to stay calm 
                         for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. 
                         There must be a way out of this! (It 
                         seems to be a complete role reversal 
                         for the two of them from the beginning, 
                         where Adam was the one freaking out 
                         and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is 
                         terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, 
                         who has just lost it.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) I cant be calm! My family 
                         needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, 
                         still cant get the phone. He quickly 
                         turns and sits up, grabbing the chain 
                         and pulling it as he lets out a terrible 
                         scream of rage. Adams hands are up 
                         clutching his head, trying to keep his 
                         cool but having a very hard time.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrences 
                         continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, 
                         I have a family too! I dont see them, 
                         thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id 
                         like to fix!
 
               Cut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after 
               him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
 
                         
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally 
               breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (desperate, losing his attempted calm 
                         stance) Lawrence, stop it!
 
               Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. 
               He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too 
               slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please 
                         calm down! Theres a way out of here, 
                         theres a way out!
 
               Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt 
               underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot 
               and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely 
               loses it and freaks out, screaming.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you 
                         doing?!
 
               Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting 
               it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness 
               and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts 
               it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam 
               begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through 
               the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences 
               shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming 
               and wincing.
 
               Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves 
               into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching 
               up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep 
               to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs 
               him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. 
               Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him 
               forward against a cage wall.
 
               Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck 
               and shirt.
 
               Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of 
               twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to 
               the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl 
               up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing 
               it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing 
               position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, 
               trying to take the gun.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming 
               and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits 
               up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward 
               a bit.
 
               Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep 
               squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between 
               Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger 
               and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former 
               detective.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. 
               He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks 
               at it. Adam watches him in terror.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming/crying) What are you doing?! 
                         (Lawrence crawls on farther, towards 
                         the body.)
 
               Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapps chest. Tapp 
               remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down 
               backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding 
               the gun up at a diagonal. Tapps eyes flutter, then finally close. 
               Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down 
               another hall.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the 
               gun, opens the chamber.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you...(He suddenly realizes 
                         Lawrences intentions. His eyes go wide, 
                         and he starts to cry out and beg.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! 
                         (Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes 
                         the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, Im 
                         begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun 
                         at Adam) Lawrence, its not me who did 
                         this to you!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking like Death, his voice hoarse) 
                         You have to die.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (His hands up in front of him defensively, 
                         moving side to side to try to throw 
                         off Lawrences aim) No, I want to live!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (moving the gun along with Adams movements) 
                         Im sorry...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I want to live!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, 
                         hitting Adam in the upper chest area. 
                         Adam falls down forward onto the floor, 
                         his screams stop.)
 
               Lawrence collapses, sobbing. Then he sits up a bit, turning to 
               the surveillance camera and screaming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive done it! Now show them to me! (he 
                         continues to cry, dropping the gun next 
                         to him, collapsing back down with his 
                         forehead to the floor.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons neighbors living room. Alison paces back 
               and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. Two neighbors sit 
               off to the side on a couch with Diana.
 
                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (OS, on phone) Thank you very much, 
                         Officer.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (on cell phone) Larry?

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (hanging up the phone and going over 
                         to Alison) Did you get through to him?
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         Theres still no answer.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (reassuringly) Its all right. Ive 
                         called the police. Everythings okay.
 
                         
               Alison goes and sits on the couch. Diana comes up to her, and 
               Alison embraces her daughter.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom, with a shot of the sliding door. The 
               sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard. Lawrence pushes 
               himself up into a kneeling position, a look of shock on his face. 
               The door slides open and there stands Zep, green mist behind 
               him in the hallway. Lawrence turns and sees him. Zeps eyes dart 
               around the room, seeming to say What the fuck happened in here? 
               He sees Lawrence on the floor, and an eager look comes into his 
               eyes. He walks in, and Lawrence starts to yell at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! 
                         (Lawrence grabs Zeps leg as he passes 
                         but is too weak and Zep pulls away, 
                         looking down at him, moving over to 
                         the other side of the body) Ill fucking 
                         kill you! You fucking bastard! (Lawrence 
                         quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up 
                         the gun, pulling the trigger several 
                         times, but there are no more bullets. 
                         It just clicks.) Ill fucking kill you! 
                         You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill 
                         you! Ill fucking kill you!
 
               Zep goes over to Adam, pushing his side with his foot a couple 
               of times, but to no reaction. He then looks to Lawrence and aims 
               his gun at him, shaking his head.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Youre too late.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) Why?

                                     ZEP
                         Its the rules.

               Zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly Adam comes to 
               and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. The back of Zeps head 
               hits the floor hard. Adam pulls him towards him, struggles to 
               get the gun from Zeps hand, screaming. The gun goes off once 
               off to the side. Adam moves Zeps arm back and forth, and it 
               goes off again. Finally, Adam slams Zeps arm down and gets the 
               gun away from him, tossing it away. He slugs Zep hard across 
               the face, stunning him. Lawrence starts crawling towards them. 
               Screaming like a madman, Adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat 
               lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto Zeps head as hard 
               as he can. He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in 
               half. Lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for Adams arm 
               as Adam brings the broken lid down again. Lawrence grabs his 
               arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching 
               his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. Lawrence 
               moves in, touching his head to Adams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice very weak and shaky) Youre 
                         going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing 
                         for a moment) Youre just wounded in 
                         the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (grasping Lawrences shirt, begging.) 
                         Dont leave me! No!
 
               Lawrence nods, pulling away from him and starts to crawl off. 
               Adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away.
 
                                     ADAM
                         No!! (he keeps crying) No! No! (Lawrence 
                         crawls towards the door.) Lawrence! 
                         Lawrence!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (he pauses, turns to look back at Adam) 
                         Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone 
                         back, I promise. (He continues crawling 
                         on, out the door while Adam watches 
                         him pathetically, still crying and reaching 
                         out for him.)
 
               Lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down 
               the hall. Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. Adam 
               looks to the door one more time then turns to Zeps body. He 
               pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking) Key...key...

               He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds 
               Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing 
               of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling 
               for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. 
               His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his 
               shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his 
               eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then 
               at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. 
               It is Jigsaws voice.

                         (VO) Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called 
                         you around the hospital: (shot of Zep 
                         in the hospital with his cleaning cart, 
                         stopping at Johns room) Zep. I want 
                         you to make a choice. (Shot of the closet 
                         doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana 
                         screaming, Alison coming in and seeing 
                         him looming over her. Shot of him tying 
                         and gagging Alison and Diana. Shot of 
                         the photo of Diana and Alison tied and 
                         gagged.) Theres a slow-acting poison 
                         coursing through your system (shot of 
                         Zep watching the monitor, holding his 
                         hand to his mouth. He actually looks 
                         rather ill) which only I have the antidote 
                         for. Will you murder and mother and 
                         her child (Zep rocking aback and forth, 
                         getting ready to kill Alison and Diana) 
                         to save yourself? (Shot of Zep next 
                         to Alison, saying Dr. Gordons time 
                         is up; holds the phone to her ear. Shot 
                         of Zep in the living room, screaming 
                         Mrs. Gordon! Shot of Zep on the floor 
                         firing up at Tapp.) Listen carefully, 
                         if you will. There are rules. (Lawrence 
                         on the floor looking up at Zep, asks 
                         Why? to which Zep says Its the rules.)
 
                         
                                     JOHN
                         The key to that chain is in the bathtub.
 
                         
                                     FLASHBACK MONTAGE
                         
               Zeps voiceover of Hes a very interesting person, with a shot 
               of John in his hospital bed with Dr. Gordon and the med students. 
               His name is John. Shot of Lawrence pointing at the chart, He 
               has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor. Close up shot of John in 
               his bed, eyes flickering open slightly.
 
               Shot of Tapp in the workshop, holding a gun to Johns head. Sick 
               from the disease eating away at me inside. Shot of the detectives 
               at Pauls cage, shot of the jigsaw puzzle piece wound on Paul, 
               Kerry saying Sounds like our friend Jigsaw.
 
                                     JOHNS VOICE
                         Sick of people who dont appreciate 
                         their blessings. Shot of Lawrence with 
                         Diana, checking his beeper, on his computer 
                         ignoring Diana and Alison, trying to 
                         kiss Alison as she pulls away.
 
               Frontal shot of John in his robe in the workshop with the detectives, 
               his arms raised, his face clearly visible. Cut to Kerry at the 
               peephole in Marks room, saying Looks like he likes to book himself 
               a front row seat to his own sick little games, with overlapping 
               footage of John on the floor in the bathroom, eyes open slightly, 
               then a shot of the pig creature crawling out of Lawrences car.
 
               
                                     JOHN
                         (VO) Hello Mark, Paul, Amanda, Zep, 
                         Adam, Dr. Gordon. (As he says each name, 
                         the following image of them appears: 
                         A shot of Mark screaming with the safe, 
                         Paul in his cage while still alive, 
                         Amanda in her mask in the chair, Zep 
                         watching on the monitor, Adam holding 
                         the tape recorder to his ear, Lawrence 
                         holding the tape recorder to his ear. 
                         Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video 
                         as he says) I want to play a game.
 
                         
               Back to the shot of Adam staring at him, shocked. Suddenly, Adam 
               looks down, grabs Zeps gun and aims for John. But before he 
               can pull the trigger John holds out the remote for the electricity 
               and starts to electrocute Adam, who starts jerking around and 
               drops the gun. As he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images 
               from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with 
               a shot of Adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then 
               Lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and 
               ending with Adam stretched out on top of Zep, spasming still 
               from the electrocution. Suddenly the electricity stops and he 
               gasps, raspy loud breathing. John turns away, starts towards 
               the door. Adam can only watch after him.
 
                                     JOHN
                         (VO) Most people are so ungrateful to 
                         be alive. (John turns off the lights 
                         at the door, only the green lighting 
                         from the hallway illuminating him and 
                         then Adam just barely. John moves out 
                         the door, slowly.) But not you. (Adam 
                         reaches out for him and screams. John 
                         turns around and takes the door handle, 
                         starting to slide it shut.) Not anymore.
 
                         
               Adam SCREAMS as loud as he can in terror and despair as John 
               pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says
 
                                     JOHN
                         GAME OVER.

               John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left 
               in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Dont!!! over 
               and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by 
               the ending titles and instrumental music.
 
               THE END

FADE IN

ON A RINGING TELEPHONE.

A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of
CASEY BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face
with innocent eyes.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN'S VOICE
            (from phone)
        Hello.

Silence.

                CASEY
        Yes.

                MAN
        Who is this?

                CASEY
        Who are you trying to reach?

                MAN
        What number is this?

                CASEY
        What number are you trying to reach?

                MAN
        I don't know.

                CASEY
        I think you have the wrong number.

                MAN
        Do I?

                CASEY
        It happens. Take it easy.

CLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
Casey in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to
the kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Casey grabs the portable.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN
        I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

                CASEY
        So why did you dial it again?

                MAN
        To apologize.

                CASEY
        You're forgiven. Bye now.

                MAN
        Wait, wait, don't hang up.

Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black
outside.

                CASEY
        What?

                MAN
        I want to talk to you for a second.

                CASEY
        They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face.

EXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak
trees.  It sits alone with no neighbors in sight.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a
lid, reaching for the portable phone.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN
        Why don't you want to talk to me?

                CASEY
        Who is this?

                MAN
        You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

                CASEY
            (shaking the popcorn)
        I don't think so.

                MAN
        What's that noise?

Casey smiles, playing along, innocently.

                CASEY
        Popcorn.

                MAN
        You're making popcorn?

                CASEY
        Uh-huh.

                MAN
        I only eat popcorn at the movies.

                CASEY
        I'm getting ready to watch a video.

                MAN
        Really? What?

                CASEY
        Just some scary movie.

                MAN
        Do you like scary movies?

                CASEY
        Uh-huh.

                MAN
        What's your favorite scary movie?

He's flirting with her.  Casey moves away from the stove and takes
a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass
door.

                CASEY
        I don't know.

                MAN
        You have to have a favorite.

Casey thinks for second.

                CASEY
        Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the
        guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around
        and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

                MAN
        Guess.

                CASEY
        Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

                MAN
        Is that the one where the guy had knives
        for fingers?

                CASEY
        Yeah...Freddy Krueger.

                MAN
        Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie.
        It was scary.

                CASEY
        The first one was, but the rest sucked.

                MAN
        So, you gotta boyfriend?

                CASEY
            (giggling)
        Why? You wanna ask me out?

                MAN
        Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

                CASEY
        No.

                MAN
        You never told me your name.

Casey smiles, twirling her hair.

                CASEY
        Why do you want to know my name?

                MAN
        Because I want to know who I'm looking
        at.

Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door.

                CASEY
        What did you say?

                MAN
        I want to now who I'm talking to.

                CASEY
        That's not what you said.

                MAN
        What do you think I said?

Casey CLICKS on the outside light.  A flood light illuminates the
backyard.  Her eyes survey the grounds.  But it's empty.  No one's
there.  She turns the light out.

On the stove, the popcorn POPS.

                CASEY
        I have to go now.

                MAN
        Wait...I thought we were gonna go out.

                CASEY
        Nah, I don't think so...

                MAN
        Don't hang up on me.

                CASEY
        Gotta go.

                MAN
        Don't...

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  She checks the glass door making sure
it's locked and then moves to the stove as...

THE PHONE RINGS.

She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone.

                CASEY
        Yes?

                MAN
        I told you not to hang up on me.

                CASEY
        What do you want?

                MAN
        To talk.

                CASEY
        Dial someone else, okay?

                MAN
        You getting scared?

                CASEY
        No-bored.

CLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it.

                CASEY
        Listen, asshole...

                MAN
            (deadly serious)
        NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU
        HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE
        A FISH. UNDERSTAND?

Total silence.  He has gotten her full attention.

                CASEY
        Is this some kind of a joke?

                MAN
        More of a game, really.

Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front
doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it.

                CASEY
        I'm two seconds from calling the police.

                MAN
        They'd never make it in time.

Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking
through the peephole.

ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE.

A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a
bit, relieved.

                CASEY
        What do you want?

                MAN
            (pure evil)
        TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the
phone, throwing it down on a side table when...

THE DOORBELL CHIMES.

Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes
again.

                CASEY
            (calling out)
        Who's there?

Another CHIME.  She moves to it.

                CASEY
            (louder)
        Who's there?

No answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for
the portable phone. Just as she picks it up...

IT RINGS.

Casey almost drops it, losing her breath...

She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying
nothing...listening, waiting...

A long silence.  And then.

                MAN
        You should never say "Who's there?".
        Don't you watch scary movies? It's a
        death wish.

Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her
damndest to hang tough.

                CASEY
        Look, enough is enough. You had your fun
        now you better leave me alone or else.

                MAN
        Or else what?

CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating...

                CASEY
        My boyfriend will be here any second and
        he'll be pissed when I tell him...

                MAN
        I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

Busted.  She holds steady.

                CASEY
        I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll
        be here any second and your ass better
        be gone.

                MAN
        Sure...

                CASEY
        I swear it. And he's big and plays
        football and will beat the shit out
        of you.

                MAN
        I'm getting scared.

                CASEY
        I'm telling you the truth.
        I lied before...

                MAN
        I believe you...

                CASEY
        So you better leave.

                MAN
        His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it.

                CASEY
        How do you know his name?

                MAN
        Go to the back door and turn on the porch
        light--again.

Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the
kitchen...to the glass doors.  Her shaky hand finds the light
switch...she hits it.  The back yard is lit.

Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big,
line backer of a guy, her boyfriend...

STEVE

tied and gagged.  He's been roughed up, but he's alive.
CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend,
pleading with her.

                CASEY
        Oh Goddddd...

Casey SCREAMS.  Her hand moves to the lock on the door.

                MAN
        I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Terror rides Casey's face.  She's petrified.

                CASEY
        Where are you?

                MAN
        Guess.

Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.  He could be
anywhere-anywhere.

                CASEY
            (begging)
        Please don't hurt him.

                MAN
        That all depends on you.

                CASEY
        Why are you doing this?

Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face.

                MAN
        I wanna play a game.

                CASEY
        No...

                MAN
        Then he dies. Right now.

                CASEY
        NOOO!

                MAN
        Which is it?

A long silence.  Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this
big jock of a guy is crying too.

                CASEY
        What kind of game?

                MAN
        Turn off the light.

Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his
straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears...

CLICK

He disappears in the darkness.  Casey moves away from the glass,
back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.

                MAN
        Here's how we play. I ask a question. If
        you get it right-Steve lives.

Three curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down
behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening
the room.  Her body quivers.

                CASEY
        Please don't do this...

                MAN
        Come on. It'll be fun.

                CASEY
        No...please.

                MAN
        It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

                CASEY
            (begging)
        ..please...

                MAN
        I'll even give you a warm up question.

                CASEY
        Don't do this. I can't..

                MAN
        Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.

                CASEY
        No...

                MAN
        Come on. It's you favorite scary movie,
        remember? He had a white mask, he
        stalked the baby-sitters.

Casey goes silent...a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much
less think.

                CASEY
        I don't know...

                MAN
        Come on, yes you do.

                CASEY
        Please..stop...

Casey is SOBBING.

                MAN
        What's his name?

                CASEY
        I can't think.

Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all
reality.

                MAN
        Steve's counting on you.

Suddenly...through tears...Godsent...

                CASEY
            (a whisper)
        Michael...Michael Myers.

                MAN
        YES!

Casey SIGHS...relieved.

                MAN
        Now for the real question.

                CASEY
        NOOOO....

                MAN
        But you're doing so well.

                CASEY
        Please go away! Leave us alone!

                MAN
        Then answer the question. Same category.

Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor.

                CASEY
        ..please..no...

                MAN
        Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.

A mad smile purses Casey's lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up,
through tears, screaming...

                CASEY
        Jason! Jason!...JASON!

A slight PAUSE.

                MAN
        I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

                CASEY
        No it's not. It was Jason.

                MAN
        Afraid not.

                CASEY
        It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie
        twenty times. It was Jason.

                MAN
        Then you should know Jason's MOTHER
        -Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason
        didn't show up until the sequel.

Casey is stupefied.

                CASEY
        You tricked me...

                MAN
        Lucky, for you there's a bonus round.
        But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out.

This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass
doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see...

STEVE

eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a
mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground
between his feet...steam rising.

A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on
the floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and
ghostly white.  She SOBS.

                MAN
        Final question. Are you ready?

She doesn't answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up
and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing,
hoping...

                CASEY
        ..leave me alone..please...

                MAN
        Answer the question and I will.

Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly
back and forth.

                MAN
        What door am I at?

                CASEY
        What?

                MAN
        There are two doors to your house. A
        front door and a back one. If you answer
        correctly-you live.

From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She
deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to
strategize.  Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to
decide between the two.

                CASEY
        Don't make me...I can't...I won't.

                MAN
        Your call.

In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up
and grabs a long, sharp knife.

Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front
door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...

SHATTERS TO BITS...

as a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays
everywhere.

This incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting
out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered
doorframe.

ANGLE ON CASEY

Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to
FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly
sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the
front door.

Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She
holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.

Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in
the house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off...

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE

Casey it at the back corner of the house.

                MAN
        I can hear you. I know you're here.

Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side
of the house...going for the front yard.  She must pass the three
curtainless windows.  She gets to the first one and peeks in...

The FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.

Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE
is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall
that leads to other parts of the house.

She moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the
third window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...

STARING BACK AT HER...

His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his
eyes piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as
a hand...

CRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she
beats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his
arm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as
the hands disappear inside the house...

EXT.  CORNER OF HOUSE

Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door.
It remains closed.  Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when
suddenly....

HEADLIGHTS APPEAR

in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she
recognizes them instantly.  Mom...Dad...she tears off across the
yard toward them...moving like lightning...

The car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly,
rushing by a tree as...

THE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS

Casey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on
her, arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck,
across the chest.  She looks down to see her shirt blossoming
red...a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee.

The knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade
comes down...but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her
hand.  She turns staggering to...

EXT.  DRIVEWAY

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.  They move to the
front door completely unaware of what's happening to their
daughter, only feet from them.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Casey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her
mouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond
words...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Her parents approach the door

                FATHER
        That fish smelled strong.

                MOTHER
        I told you to send it back.

The father discovers the front door ajar.  A puzzled look.  Casey
is right behind them with one arm outstretched.  If they'd only
turn around...

They enter the house and close the door as....

Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the
FIGURE upon her.

INT.  FOYER

The father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered
patio door.

                FATHER
        Jesus...

                MOTHER
        What is it? Where's Casey?

                FATHER
            (calling out)
        Casey? Casey?

In a split second they're both panic stricken.  The father begins
searching the house frantically.  The mother is hysterical.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

CLOSE ON Casey...she's dragged by her feet through damp soil...the
life going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the
phone.

INT.  FOYER

Back in the house.

                MOTHER
        Where is she?

                FATHER
        Call the police.

The mother moves  to the phone in the foyer, picks it up...There
is no dial tone.  She jiggles the base.

                FATHER
            (searching)
        Casey? Where are you honey? Call the
        police, goddammit.

                MOTHER
        The phone's dead.

The...the softest...faintest voice is heard...

                CASEY
            (from phone)
        ..help me...

                MOTHER
        She's here, God, I can hear her.
        Where's my baby?

The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the
phone.

                FATHER
        Where is she?

                MOTHER
        I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,
        I can hear her.

The father upturns the living room.

                FATHER
        Casey! Casey!

                MOTHER
        Not my daughter...not my...

The husband grabs hold of his wife.

                FATHER
        Get in the car and drive down to
        the Mackenzie's.

The other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father
moves through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.  That of his
wife.  He tears off for the front door.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees,
bent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front
yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares
witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see.

That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak
tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.

BLACKOUT!

BEGIN MAIN TITLES

FADE IN:

INT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

A teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age-
old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a
desk against the wall where...

SIDNEY PRESCOTT

a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor
in front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep,
lonely eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.

Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...

CRASH-BOOM

A noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window
across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward
it.

EXT.  WINDOW

Sidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits
her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand
reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...

INT.  BEDROOM

Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free,
falling back onto the floor.

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Hey...it's just me.

Sid looks up to see...

BILLY LOOMIS

A young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A
star quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile
that could last for days.

                SIDNEY
        Billy? What the...

                BILLY
        I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

                SIDNEY
        What are you doing here?

                BILLY
        You sleep in THAT?

Billy pulls himself through the window.

                SIDNEY
            (whispering)
        My dad's in the other room.

                BILLY
        I'll only stay a sec.

Suddenly...

The bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open
closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.

                VOICE
            (from behind door)
        What's going on in there?

Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams
the door to reveal...

MR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man,
nervous and pre-occupied.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        Are you okay?

                SIDNEY
        Can you knock?

                MR. PRESCOTT
        I heard screaming.

                SIDNEY
        No you didn't.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My
        flight leaves first thing in the morning.
        Now the expo runs all weekend so I
        won't be back til Sunday. There's cash
        on the table and I'll be staying at the
        Raleigh Hilton...

                SIDNEY
        ..out at the airport...

                MR. PRESCOTT
        ..so call if you need me.

                SIDNEY
        Got it.

He gives the bedroom a quick once over.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        I coulda swore I heard screaming.

Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek.

                SIDNEY
        Have a good trip.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        Sleep tight, sweetie.

He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears.

                BILLY
        Close call.

                SIDNEY
        What are you doing here?

Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.

                BILLY
        It just occurred to me that I've never
        snuck through your bedroom window.

                SIDNEY
        Now that it's out of your system.

                BILLY
        And I was home, bored, watching
        television, THE EXORCIST was on
        and it got me thinking of you.

                SIDNEY
        Oh it did?

                BILLY
        Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good
        stuff was cut out and I started thinking
        about us and how two years ago, we started
        off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R"
        rating on our way to an NC17. And how
        things have changed and, lately, we're just
        sot of...edited for television.

                SIDNEY
        So you thought you could sneak in my
        window and we would  have little bump-
        bump.

                BILLY
        No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your
        underwear rule. I just thought we might do
        some on top of the clothes stuff.

She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips.
Passionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving
on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into
her...Sidney breaks away.

                SIDNEY
        Time to go, stud bucket.

Billy sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING.

                BILLY
        See what you do to me.

Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.

                SIDNEY
        You know what my dad will do to you?

                BILLY
        I'm going...I'm going.

He moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound.

                SIDNEY
        I appreciate the romantic gesture.

She gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple.

                BILLY
            (whisper)
        Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying
        to rush you. I was only half serious.

She kisses him again as he eases through the window.

                SIDNEY
        Would you settle for a PG-13
        relationship?

                BILLY
        What's that?

She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her
left breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes
meet.  They share a smile.

                SIDNEY
        Get outa here.

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

CLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...

THE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake
the dead.  Sidney bolts up.

                DISC JOCKEY
            (from radio)
        ..found brutally murdered...

CLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly.
A car trunk SLAMS shut outside.

Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in
time to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at
him but he doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of
the driveway and disappearing down the road.

A moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.

EXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING

CLOSE ON A SIGN

"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS"

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town
school.  Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about.
Nothing unusual, except for the...

six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and
crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus.

EXT.  SIDEWALK

Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different
REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four
different news reports.

She moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked,
she stops at the first reporter who is...

GALE WEATHERS

Thirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a
massive mane of chemically enhanced hair.

                GALE
            (for the camera)
        The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina
        was devastated last night when two young
        teenagers were found brutally butchered.
        Authorities have yet to issue a statement
        but our sources tell us that no arrest
        has been made and the murderer could
        strike again...

ON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her
shoulder.  She spins around to see...

Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree.

                TATUM
        Do you believe this shit?

                SIDNEY
        What happened?

They break away from the crowd and head for school.

                TATUM
        Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker
        and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

                SIDNEY
        No way.

                TATUM
        And not just killed, Sid. We're talking
        splatter movie killed-split open end to
        end.

                SIDNEY
        Casey Becker? She sits next to me in
        English.

                TATUM
        Not anymore. Her parents found her
        hanging from a tree. Her insides on the
        outside.

                SIDNEY
        Do they know who did it?

                TATUM
        Fucking clueless-they're interrogating
        the entire school. Teachers, students,
        staff, janitors...

                SIDNEY
        They think it's school-related?

                TATUM
        They don't know. Dewey said this is
        the worst crime they've ever seen.
        Even worse than...
            (stopping herself)
        Well it's bad. They're bringing in the
        feds. This is big.

Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained.

INT.  CLASSROOM - LATER

A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped
together.  A tragic look upon her face.

                MRS. TATE
        ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable
        loss. It's days like today we need
        prayer in school...

Sidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her
sits vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it.

The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand
s it to Mrs. Tate.

                MRS. TATE
        Sidney. It appears to be your turn.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes.
Some sit, stand, lean...

SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from
his face.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Who's up next?

A young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY,
better known as DEWEY.  He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a
scrubbed-clean boyish way.

                DEWEY
        Sidney Prescott.

Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's,
an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...

                DEWEY
        We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How she doin'?

                MR. HIMBRY
        She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A"
        average. You never know she...

Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and
seats her.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hi Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

Dewey shakes his head seriously.

                DEWEY
        It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How is everything?

                SIDNEY
        Good.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        And your Dad? How's he doing?

                SIDNEY
        We're fine. Thanks.

                MR. HIMBRY
        We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a
        few questions they'd like to ask you...

Sidney eyes them all nervously.

EXT.  SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER

Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch.  Crowded at one table
is the "gang".  This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.

Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped
across her back.  He's a Billy wannabe.  Almost the jock, almost
handsome, almost cool.  He tries way to hard.

Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.  A tall and gangly kid
with no such Billy-like aspirations.  A witty jokester who
elevates geek to coolness.

                TATUM
        Hunt? Why would they ask if you like
        to hunt?

                STU
        I don't know, they just did.

                RANDY
        Because their bodies were gutted.

Sidney flinches.

                BILLY
        Thanks Randy.

                TATUM
        They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

                STU
        Because there's no way a girl could have
        killed them.

                TATUM
        That is so sexist. The killer could
        easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.

                RANDY
        That was an ice pick-not exactly the
        same.

                STU
        Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely
        hollowed out. Takes a man to do
        something like that.

                TATUM
        Or a man's mentality.

                SIDNEY
            (quiet, almost to herself)
        How do you gut someone?

All eyes turn to Sidney.  A serious silence.  And then:

                STU
        You take a knife and slit from the groin
        to the sternum.

Sidney shivers down to her soul.  The whole table rolls their eyes
at Stu.

                STU
        What? She asked.

                BILLY
        It's called tact, you fuckrag.

                STU
        Sorry.

                RANDY
        Remember in JAWS when they caught the
        wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss
        cut it open to look foe body parts and all
        they found was a licence plate and all this
        white milky goo.

Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.

                STU
        You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.

                SIDNEY
        Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?

Stu's taken back, a little off guard.

                STU
        For about two seconds.

                RANDY
        Before she dumped him foe Steve.

Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.

                TATUM
        I thought you dumped her for me.

                STU
        I did. He's full of shit.

                RANDY
        And are the police aware you dated the
        victim?

                STU
            (offended)
        What are you saying? That I killed
        her or something?

                RANDY
        It would certainly improve your high
        school Q.

                TATUM
        Stu was with me last night.

                RANDY
        Oooooh...before or after he sliced and
        diced.

                TATUM
        Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last
        night?

                RANDY
        Working, thank you.

                TATUM
        I thought Blockbuster fired you.

                RANDY
        Twice.

                STU
        I didn't kill anybody.

                BILLY
        No one's saying you did.

                RANDY
        Besides-
            (perfect Stu mimic)
        "Takes a man to do something like that."

                STU
        I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

                RANDY
            (to Stu)
        Did you really put her liver in the
        mailbox? I hear they found her liver
        in the mailbox.

                TATUM
            (eyeing Sidney)
        Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.

Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck.

                STU
        Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think
        you better liver alone.

Stu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is
about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.

EXT.  SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER

A huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.

A yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps
off.

The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the
front door.

INT.  BEDROOM - LATER

Sidney is on the telephone.

                SIDNEY
            (into phone)
        You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't
        be back til Sunday.

                TATUM
            (through phone)
        No prob. I'll pick you up after
        practice.

                SIDNEY
        Tell your mom I said thanks.

                TATUM
        Yeah, yeah...are you okay?

                SIDNEY
        Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police
        and reporters...it brings it all back.

                TATUM
        I'll be there by seven. I promise

                SIDNEY
        Thanks, Tatum.

                TATUM
        Later.

Sidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it
up.  She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own
reflection staring back.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of
clothes, toothbrush, make-up...

She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the
top shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping
down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

A news reporter fades in.

                REPORTER #1
            (on TV)
        The entire nation was shocked today by
        the teen murders in North Carolina...

Sidney switches channels.

                REPORTER #2
        The State Bureau of Investigation has
        joined forces with local authorities to
        help catch what the Governor has called
        the most heinous...

The channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in
front of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming.

                GALE
        This is not the first time the small town
        of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only
        a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and
        mother, was found raped and murdered...

An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman,
beautiful and familiar.

CLOSE ON SIDNEY

eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV
off.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her
eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and
white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older
version of Sidney.

Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

The clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep
on the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the
portable phone.

                TATUM
            (from phone)
        Practice ran late. I'm on my way.

                SIDNEY
            (eyes clock)
        It's past seven.

                TATUM
        Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite
        it til way after ten.

                SIDNEY
        I'm not worried.

                TATUM
        Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER
        and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
        ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you
        pause it just right you can see his penis.

                SIDNEY
        Whatever. Just hurry.

                TATUM
        Bye.

She hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again.

                SIDNEY
            (into phone)
        Tatum?

                MAN'S VOICE
            (from phone)
        Hello, Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.

                SIDNEY
        Hi. Who is this?

                MAN
        You tell me.

Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little
distorted.

                SIDNEY
        I have no idea.

                MAN
        Scary night, isn't it? With the murders
        and all, it's like right out of a horror
        movie or something.

                SIDNEY
        Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are
        you calling from work? Tatum's on her
        way over.

                MAN
        Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

                SIDNEY
        I like that thing you're doing with your
        voice, Randy. It's sexy.

                MAN
        What's your favorite scary movie?

                SIDNEY
        Don't start. You know I don't watch that
        shit.

                MAN
        And why is that?

                SIDNEY
            (playing along)
        Because they're all the same. It's
        always some stupid killer stalking some
        big breasted girl-who can't act-who
        always runs up the stairs when she should
        be going out the front door. They're
        ridiculous.

A brief silence.

                MAN
        Are you alone in the house?

                SIDNEY
        That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,
        Randy.

                MAN
        Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

                SIDNEY
        So who are you?

                MAN
        The question is not who am I. The
        question is where am I?

                SIDNEY
        So where are you?

                MAN
        Your front porch.

This gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the
drapes.

                SIDNEY
        Why would you call me from my
        front porch?

                MAN
        That's the original part.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can't quite see all of the porch.

                SIDNEY
        Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.

Sidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the
chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...

COMPLETELY EMPTY.

She steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines
overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is
all around.

                SIDNEY
        So where are you?

                MAN
        Right here.

Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on
either side of the porch.

                SIDNEY
        Can you see me right now?

                MAN
        Uh-huh.

                SIDNEY
        What am I doing?

She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence.
No answer.

                SIDNEY
        Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.
        Bye now.

                MAN
        If you hang up, you'll die just like your
        mother.

Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.

                MAN
            (deadly)
        Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother
        didn't.

His seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle.

                SIDNEY
        FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!

She hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains,
and bolts the door when...

A FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET

rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is
on top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...

She looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale,
distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask.

Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the
contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his
hand finding her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears
above her.

Sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward
knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living
room.  Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.

She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it
catches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking
behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.
Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...

RUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her.

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING

The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs
madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet
country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the
wall swinging it behind her...

It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending
him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her
bedroom...

INT.  BEDROOM

She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing
the edge right at the door knob just as...

THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...

ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a
crazy vice-like hold.

Sidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs.

The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but
won't give.

Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.

CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.

        FAX MODEM

        9-1-1 SEND

The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.

ON SCREEN AGAIN

        HELP KILLER

        34 ELM ST

Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The
FIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only
sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING.

ON THE SCREEN

        "Stay calm.  Police enroute."

Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...

BILLY

her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.

                SIDNEY
        Oh Billy...Please...God...

                BILLY
        I heard screaming. The door was locked.
        Are you okay...

                SIDNEY
        He's here. He's trying to kill me...

Billy pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black
object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney
eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.

Sidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A
SIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts...

                BILLY
        Hey...wait...what's goin..

Billy reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears
out of the room.

INT.  LANDING

Sidney nearly falls down the stairs...

INT.  FOYER

She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to
face with a white, ghostly mask.
A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK

to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens
BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house.

Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER

The yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars,
cops everywhere...

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE

as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are
being cuffed, his rights being read.

                BILLY
            (screaming)
        I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?
        Ask her, she'll tell ya...

Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.

                DEWEY
        We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus...

                DEWEY
        He's her boyfriend.

They approach Billy as he's being placed in a squad car.

                BILLY
        Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call
        my Dad..please...

The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop
in front of the house.  Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.

Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.

                DEWEY
        I was first to respond.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What were you doing out here?

                DEWEY
        Drive by patrol.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How is she?

                DEWEY
        She's tough.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as
PARAMEDICS check her out.

Sheriff Burke and Riley approach.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        We're seeing a lot of you today.

She tries to smile but fails.

                DEWEY
        You gonna be able to come down to the
        station and talk to us a bit?

                SIDNEY
        ..yeah...

TATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.

                TATUM
        What happened? Oh God...

Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her.

                DEWEY
            (to Tatum)
        What are you doing here?

                TATUM
        Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

                DEWEY
        You can't be here, Tatum. This is an
        official crime scene.

                SIDNEY
        It's okay. She was supposed to pick me
        up.

                TATUM
        Her dad's out of town. She's staying
        with us.

                DEWEY
        Does mom know?

                TATUM
        Yes, you doofus.

Two news vans come driving up the street.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        The vultures are coming. Let's get you
        out of here.

EXT.  STREET

A big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house.  The
side door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to
see Sidney being escorted to a squad car.

                GALE
        I'll be damned.

Jumping from the driver's seat is KENNY, Gale's cameraman and
flunky.  An earnest young chap on the chubby side.

                KENNY
        What? What?

                GALE
        Jesus! The camera-hurry!

But it's too late.  Sidney is as good as gone.  Gale sees Tatum
moving quickly to her car.

                GALE
        Excuse me?

Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her.

                GALE
        Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?

                TATUM
        I don't know.

Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her.

                GALE
        What happened to her?

                TATUM
        I'm not talking to you.

Tatum's car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera.

                KENNY
        Where'd she go?

Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites.

                GALE
        Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty
        pounds overweight but when I say hurry
        please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR
        FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!

Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed.

INT.  POLICE STATION

A small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with
four desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the
Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches.

                SIDNEY
        Did you reach my Dad?

                DEWEY
        You're sure it was the Hilton?

                SIDNEY
        At the airport.

                DEWEY
        He's not registered. Could he have gone
        to another hotel?

                SIDNEY
        I don't know. I guess.

                DEWEY
        We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

Sidney stares blankly, numb.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his
father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What are you doing with a cellular
        telephone, son?

                MR. LOOMIS
        It's my phone. He was just playing
        around with it.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        You got some ideas of playing around, boy.

                BILLY
        I didn't call anyone with it. I just
        took it for fun.

                MR. LOOMIS
        Everybody's got one now. Why don't you
        check the phone bill for chrissakes.
        Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll
        have records of every number dialed.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were
        you doing out at Sidney's tonight?

                BILLY
        I just wanted to see her, that's all.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        You rode your bike out there?

                BILLY
        Yes, sir.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        And last night? Sidney said you crawled
        through her window last night too?

                MR. LOOMIS
            (surprised)
        You were out last night?

                BILLY
        I watched TV for awhile but the I felt
        like going for a bike ride.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?

                BILLY
        No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone,
        Sheriff.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The
        governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows
        who else on their way down here.

Billy fights tears.

                BILLY
        This is crazy. I didn't do it.

Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully.

INT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER

Tatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff's door opens and Billy is
led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door
watching Tatum comfort Sidney.

OUT OF EAR SHOT

                DEWEY
        That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's
        and WalMart. Neither of which keep
        purchase records.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What about the cellular phone bill?

                DEWEY
        They're pulling Loomis' account. But
        it'll be morning before we see something.
        You think he did it?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Twenty years ago I woulda said not a
        chance. But these kids today...damn if I
        know.

                TATUM
            (o.s.)
        Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?

                DEWEY
        Hold up a sec...

                SHERIFF BURKE
        She staying with you?

                DEWEY
        We haven't located her Dad yet.

                TATUM
            (o.s.)
        Goddammit, Dewey!

Dewey turns to her, his face red.

                DEWEY
        What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
        badge you treat me like a man of the law.

                TATUM
        I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're
        ready to go.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Use the back way. Avoid the circus.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SIDE DOOR

The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla OFFICERS
exit avoiding the horde of REPORTERS that can be seen around the
corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance.

                DEWEY
        I'll get the car. Wait here.

Dewey takes off.  From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers
appears with Kenny and his camera.  They've been waiting.

                GALE
        Hello Sidney.

Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her.
Sidney's body tightens and her face goes taut.

                GALE
        Some night. Are you alright?

Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare.  Sidney says nothing.
She's visibly shaking.

                GALE
        What happened?

                TATUM
        She's not answering any questions. Just
        leave us alone, okay?

                SIDNEY
        It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her
        job. Right, GALE?

                GALE
        Yes, that's right.

Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up.  The
other news people have wisened up.  They begin to flock the alley.

                SIDNEY
        How's the book?

                GALE
        It'll be out later this year.

Sidney tries to contain herself..squeezing a clenched fist.

                SIDNEY
        I'll look for it.

                GALE
        I'll send you a copy.

In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward,
SMASHING it hard into Gale Weathers's face.  The impact sends Gale
reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the
pavement.

ON SIDNEY...breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face.

INT.  TATUM'S BEDROOM - LATER

A spacious bedroom.  Typical.  Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed.
They both wear night shirts.

                TATUM
        God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
        BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a
        copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!

Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice.

                DEWEY
        I thought you might want some ice for
        that right hook.

Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand.

                DEWEY
        I'll be right next door. Try to get some
        sleep.

Dewey moves back out the door.

                SIDNEY
        Any word on my Dad?

                DEWEY
            (turning to her)
        Not yet, but we're looking. If you need
        anything...

                TATUM
        Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out.  Sidney lies
back down.

                SIDNEY
        Just another sleepover at the Riley's.

                TATUM
        Just like old times, ain't it?

                SIDNEY
        No, nothing's like it used to be.

Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum.

A telephone RINGS somewhere in the house.

                TATUM
        Do you really think Billy did it?

                SIDNEY
        He was there, Tatum.

                TATUM
        I knew this guy was too perfect. He was
        destined to have a flaw.

A KNOCK at the door.  It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops
in.  This is MAMA RILEY.  She wears a comforting smile.

                MAMA RILEY
        Telephone, dear.

                TATUM
        Who is it?

                MAMA RILEY
        It's for Sid

                SIDNEY
        My Dad?

Mama Riley shakes her head sadly.

                TATUM
        Take a message.

                SIDNEY
        It's alright. I'll get it.

Sidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum.

                MAMA RILEY
            (whispers)
        How is she?

Tatum shrugs.

INT.  HALLWAY

Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall.

                SIDNEY
        Hello?

                MAN
            (from phone)
        Hello Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body
goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES
OUT.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOO...

Mama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the
bedroom.

                MAN
            (from phone)
        Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy
        doesn't stand a chance with you.

                SIDNEY
        LEAVEMEALONE!

                MAN
        Looks like you fingered the wrong
        guy...again.

                SIDNEY
        Who are you?

                TATUM
        Hang up, Sid.

                MAN
        Don't worry. You'll find out soon
        enough. I promise.

Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door.

                MAMA RILEY
        Dewey! Dewey!

                MAN
        This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like
        old times.

CLICK.

Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his
gun.

                DEWEY
        What? What?

The phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen.

EXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to
life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens
from a restless sleep.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for
school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits
on the counter BLARING.

Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone.

                MAMA RILEY
        I think you girls really should stay home
        today.

                TATUM
        Your objection is duly noted.

                SIDNEY
        I'd rather be around a lot of people,
        Mama Riley.

From the TV, Sidney hears her name, "SIDNEY PRESCOTT..."  All eyes
go to the television.

                REPORTER
            (on TV)
        ..who escaped a vicious attack last night
        was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who
        was brutally killed last year when
        convicted murderer Cotton Weary...

INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man,
now haggard and worn.

                REPORTER
            (cont'd)
        ..broke into their home and savagely
        raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton
        Weary is currently awaiting appeal for
        the death sentence handed down after the
        young Sidney testified against him. She
        was the key witness in the state's
        prosecution...

                SIDNEY
        It's never gonna stop. Is it?

Dewey is off the phone.

                DEWEY
        Billy was released. His cellular bill
        was clean. He didn't make those calls.

                SIDNEY
        Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not
        making it up.

                DEWEY
        I know. We're checking every cellular
        account in the county. Any calls made to
        you or Casey Becker are being cross-
        referenced. It's gonna take time but
        we'll find him.

                SIDNEY
        And my Dad? Any word on him?

Riley shakes his head "no".

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER

Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they
make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that
teenage insight.

Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the
passenger's window.

INT.  PATROL CAR

Dewey pulls up in front of the school.  Tatum hops out while Sid
lingers, suddenly unsure.  Dewey takes notice.

                DEWEY
        Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here.

Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in
her face...

                REPORTER
        How does it feel to almost be brutally
        murdered?

Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter.

                DEWEY
        Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants
        to go to school.

Sidney eyes the newsvan that's pulled up behind her.  The side
door slides open and Gale Weathers steps out.

                TATUM
        Come on, Sid.

                SIDNEY
        Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.

She heads over to Gale.

EXT.  NEWSVAN - STREET

Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other
reporters as she makes her way to...

Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror.
Makeup tries hard to hide Sid's handwork-a swollen black and blue
right cheek.

Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.

                GALE
        Stop right there.

Sidney throws her hands up in surrender.

                SIDNEY
        I'm not here to fight.

                GALE
        Just stay back.

                SIDNEY
        I want to talk to you.

                GALE
            (calling into the van)
        Kenny. Camera. Now.

Kenny's head darts out from the van.

                SIDNEY
        Off the record. No cameras.

                GALE
        Forget it.

Sidney contains herself.

                SIDNEY
        Please. You owe me.

                GALE
        I owe you shit.

Gale moves inside the van.  But Sidney is relentless.

                SIDNEY
        You owe my mother.

                GALE
        Your mother's murder was last year's
        hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
        write a book about it.

                SIDNEY
        And it had to be you with all your lies
        and bullshit theories.

                GALE
        What is your problem? You got what you
        wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.
        They're gonna gas him. A book is not
        gonna change that.

                SIDNEY
        Do you still think he's innocent?

Gale's interest is peaked.  She eyes Sidney suspiciously.

                GALE
        He was convicted in a court of law. Your
        testimony put him away. It doesn't
        matter what I think.

                SIDNEY
        During the trial, you did all those
        stories about me. You called me a liar.

                GALE
        I think you falsely identified him. Yes.

                SIDNEY
        Have you talked to Cotton?

                GALE
        Many times.

                SIDNEY
        Has his story changed?

                GALE
        Not one word. He admits to having sex
        with your mother but that's all.

                SIDNEY
        He's lying. She wouldn't have touched
        him. He raped her, then butchered her.
        Her blood was all over his coat.

                GALE
        He was drunk that night. He left his
        coat at your house, after your mother
        seduced him...

                SIDNEY
        I saw him leaving wearing it.

                GALE
        But couldn't it have been someone else
        you saw wearing that coat? The same
        person who planted it in Cotton's car,
        framing him? The same person who
        really killed your mother?

A long beat.  Sidney considers this for the millionth time.

                SIDNEY
        No, Cotton murdered my mother.

But there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up.

                GALE
        You're not so sure anymore, are you?

Sidney clams up.

                SIDNEY
        No, it was Cotton.

Tatum comes waltzing up.

                TATUM
            (to GALE)
        Nice welt.

Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing.

                GALE
        The killer is still on the loose, isn't
        he? These murders are related.

                TATUM
        Yo--let's rock.

Sidney starts to fidget.

                SIDNEY
        I'm sorry I mangled your face.

She take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her.

                GALE
        Wait, Sidney, don't go...

But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of
students moving across campus.

Gale looks to Kenny.

                GALE
        Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death
        row. A killer still on the loose.
        Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

                KENNY
        You want to go live?

Gale's mind races with possibilities.

                GALE
        No, not so fast. We have nothing
        concrete.

                KENNY
        When did that ever stop you? You can't
        sit on this. This is huge.

                GALE
        If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard
        proof.

                KENNY
        But it's so much easier when we make it
        up.

                GALE
        Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.
        Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.

EXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER

Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus.

                TATUM
        Just relax. You're at school now. No
        one can get you here.

                SIDNEY
        But if it wasn't Billy it could be
        anybody. He could be here at school
        right now.

They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them,
sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK.

                TATUM
        Serial killers are smart by definition.
        They minimize their risk. They plan and
        pre-calculate everything. Showing up
        here would be the most lame-brain
        move he could make.

                SIDNEY
        He promised me he'd be back.

As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site,
unseen by either of them.

                TATUM
        I wouldn't put too much stock in a
        psycho's promise.

They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school
as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the
steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks.

She steps back, spinning around to find...

A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing
in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up
LAUGHING, tearing off across campus.

EXT.  STREET

In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote.
He holds a mask in his hand.

                REPORTER
        This morning several students, in what
        appears to be a prank, have been spotted
        wearing masks. School officials have yet
        to comment but this is the same type of
        mask worn by the killer...

INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Just before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students
heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

                TATUM
        I want you to meet me here right after
        class, okay?

Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots
him first.

                TATUM
        Shit, what is he doing here?

                SIDNEY
        I bet he's pissed.

                TATUM
        Just ignore him. You had good reason to
        think what you did.

Billy and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn.

                BILLY
        Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?

Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum
intervenes.

                TATUM
        You know if I were accused of carving up
        two people, I'd take the opportunity to
        skip school.

                STU
        Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

                BILLY
        Talk to me, Sid.

Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT
running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.

                SIDNEY
        Why are they doing this?

                STU
        Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

Billy punches Stu in the side.

                STU
        Owwww...

                BILLY
        You open your mouth and stupidity pours
        out.

                STU
        Sorry.

Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off
after her.

                TATUM
            (yelling)
        Stay away from her, Billy.

Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.

INT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

With first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two
struggling students can be seen rushing to class.

Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running
smack into...

BILLY

They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out
of her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.

                SIDNEY
        Jesus, SHIT!

                BILLY
        Hey, hey, it's just me.

Sidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight.

                BILLY
        What? You don't still think it's me?

Sidney catches her breath.

                SIDNEY
        No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,
        someone was there, someone tried to
        kill me.

                BILLY
        The police say I scared him off. It
        wasn't me, Sid.

                SIDNEY
        I know. He called again last night at
        Tatum's house.

                BILLY
        See, it couldn't have been me. I was in
        jail, remember?

                SIDNEY
        I'm so sorry...please understand.

                BILLY
        Understand what? That I got a girlfriend
        who would rather accuse me of being a
        psychopathic killer than touch me.

                SIDNEY
        You know that's not true.

                BILLY
        Then what is it? Is there somebody else?

                SIDNEY
        No...

                BILLY
        Is it the sex thing? Am I being too
        pushy?

                SIDNEY
        No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm
        still adjusting to my mom.

                BILLY
        It's been a year since she died.

                SIDNEY
            (correcting him)
        Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

                BILLY
        When are you gonna let that go, Sid?
        When my mom left my dad--I just accepted
        it. This is the way it is. She's not coming
        back.

                SIDNEY
            (sharply)
        Your parents split up. It's not the same
        thing. Your mom left town, she's not in
        a coffin somewhere.

                BILLY
        You have to move on, Sid.

Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.

                SIDNEY
        I'm glad to know you're coping so well
        with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so
        perfect. Some of us are just trying to
        hold on.

Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving
Billy alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at
himself.

INT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM

Large and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a
row of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle
and talk--each from their respective stalls.

                GIRL #1
        She was never attacked. I think she made
        it all up.

                GIRL #2
        Why would she lie about it?

                GIRL #1
        For attention. The girl has some serious
        issues.

Sidney listens intently.

A toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just
as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a
snotty little twit.

                GIRL #1
        What if she did it? What if Sidney
        killed Casey and Steve?

                GIRL #2
        And why would she do that?

                GIRL #1
        Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed
        them both in a jealous rage.

Another toilet FLUSHES.

                GIRL #2
        Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?
        She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

                GIRL #1
        Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.

INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening.

                GIRL #2
        You're evil.

                GIRL #1
        Please, it's common knowledge. Her
        mother was a trollop.

GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in
front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.

                GIRL #2
        Cut some slack. She watched her mom get
        butchered.

                GIRL #1
        And it fucked her up royally. Think
        about it. It makes perfect sense. Her
        mom's death leaves her distraught and
        hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,
        she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.
        Completely suicidal. And one day she
        snaps. She wants to kill herself but
        realizes teen suicide is out this year.
        And homicide is a much healthier
        therapeutic expression.

From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.

                GIRL #2
        Where do you get this shit?

                GIRL #1
        Ricki Lake.

The two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her
reflection in the mirror.

                SIDNEY
        Pathetic.

Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from
the cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like
a whisper,   "Siddneey..."

Sidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom.
The doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans
beneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing.

Sidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly...

                MAN
            (o.c. whisper)
        Siddneey...

Unmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail
through the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands
thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.

                SIDNEY
        Is someone there?

A long, morose silence.  And then:

                MAN
            (softly, simply)
        It's me, Sidney.

Sidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her
face.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must
pass to get to it.

She checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is
he?  She takes a step forward when...

TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall.
Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open.
She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet
floor...her feet flying out from under...

Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from
falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her.
A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit
door...narrowly escaping.

INT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the
hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer
out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not
stopping...running madly.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot
act.

MR. HIMBRY
I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing,
thieving, whoring generation disgusts me.

The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS
standing at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the
student's heads.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Two students have been savagely murdered.
        And this is how we express our compassion
        and sensivity?

He rips the mask off the other student.

                MR. HIMBRY
        We throw on a mask and dance around
        campus just hoping someone else gets
        butchered before we get bored again.
        You're both expelled.

The GHOSTS doth protest...

                GHOST #1
        Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a
        joke.

                GHOST #2
        Yeah, that's not fair.

A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither
student budges, scared to even breathe.

                MR. HIMBRY
        No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to
        rip your insides out and hang you from
        a tree so you can be exposed for the
        desensitized, heartless little shits that
        you are.

Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.

                SIDNEY
            (crying)
        He's here...I saw him...he's here...

Mr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Easy child.

Sidney collapses in his arms.

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.  He stands
in the open driver's door talking on the radio.

                SHERIFF BURKE
            (from radio)
        She's okay. Looks like some boys were
        teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the
        school though. I want you to take look
        around.

                DEWEY
        Yes, sir, sheriff.

Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers
appears, her fake face aglow.

                GALE
        Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,
        INSIDE STORY.

                DEWEY
        I know who you are, ma'am. How's the
        eye?

                GALE
        Productive. So they're closing down the
        school?

                DEWEY
        Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.

Dewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him
flirtatiously.

                GALE
        And why is that? Has something happened?

                DEWEY
        You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

                GALE
        I know, I should be in New York covering
        the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?
        Please, call me Gale. You look awfully
        young to be a police officer.

Dewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips
move as she walks...he's clearly distracted.

                DEWEY
        I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

                GALE
        Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study
        I proved to be most popular amongst
        males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,
        you don't look a day over twelve, except
        in the upper torso area. Does the force
        require that you work out?

Dewey looks away, blushing a bit.

                DEWEY
        No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good
        looks, muscle mass has increased my
        acceptance as a serious police officer.

They approach the school's front entrance.  Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's
VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA
system.  They stop to listen.

                MR. HIMBRY
            (via PA)
        "Your attention please. Due to the
        recent events that have occurred and
        until it comes to a resolve--effective
        immediately--all classes are suspended
        til further notice. The Bayboro Police
        Dept. has also asked me to announce a
        city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock
        PM. I repeat..."

Gale speaks over Mr. Himbry's voice.

                GALE
        Boy, you people sure do make fuss over
        a serial killer.

                DEWEY
        Serial killer is not really accurate,
        ma'am. The killer has yet to strike
        twice.

                GALE
        Well, we can hope, can't we? We
        certainly don't have any leads. A ghost
        mask, a cellular phone--not much there.

                DEWEY
        We're tracking the cellular phone bill.

                GALE
        Really? You small town guys are good.
        And have you located Sidney's father?

                DEWEY
        No, not yet.

                GALE
        He's not a suspect, is he?

                DEWEY
        We haven't ruled out that possibil...

Dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.

                DEWEY
        If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

                GALE
        Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

                DEWEY
        That's quite alright. If I may say so,
        ma'am, you're much prettier in person.

Dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell RINGS.

                GALE
        So you do watch the show?

He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front
doors.

                DEWEY
        I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole
        year.

                GALE
        You are precious. Please, call me Gale.

She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as
Dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.

INT.  SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

School is clearing out.  The halls have begun to empty as Tatum
escorts Sidney down the hallway.

                TATUM
        It was just some sick fuck having a
        laugh.

                SIDNEY
        It was him, Tatum. I know it.

Tatum wants to believe her but...

                TATUM
        You are not to be alone again. Is that
        clear? If you pee--I pee.

Stu appears.

                STU
        Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,
        what happened?

                TATUM
        For once, Stu, drop it.

                STU
        Okay, but whatever you did--the entire
        student body thanks you.

Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.

                STU
        And to celebrate this impromptu fall
        break, I propose we have a party.
        Tonight, my house.

                SIDNEY
        Are you serious?

                STU
        My parents are out of town. It'll be
        like my hurricane bash last year.
        Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,
        hangin'.

Tatum warms to the idea.

                TATUM
        This could be good. What do you think,
        Sid?

                SIDNEY
        I don't know...

                TATUM
        Come on. Pathos has it's perks.

Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.

                STU
        Remember, there's safety in numbers.

                SIDNEY
            (giving in)
        Yeah, okay...whatever.

                STU
        Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.

Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before
him.  He picks one of them up, snickering.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Damn...

He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He
pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries
the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror
when...

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head,
turns to his office door and opens it to reveal...

AN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area
and looks around.  But no one's there.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Yes? Hello?

The place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door,
catching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the
mask in his hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later...

ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this
time throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into
the outer office determined to catch a prankster.

INT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Completely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and
into the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned
off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and
down the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a
broom.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Little shits.

Mr. Himbry returns to his office.

INT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the
closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT.

This gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly,
he can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob,
pulling the door open to reveal...

AN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing
someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door.
Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal...

NOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked
himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut
when...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.
Quick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes
down.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him.

EXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER

The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.

Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the
small town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the
driveway.

Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet
moment.

                TATUM
        Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.
        Maybe he was having an affair with your
        mom.

                SIDNEY
        So you think my mom was a slut too?

                TATUM
        I didn't say that, Sid. But you know
        there were rumors. Your dad was
        always out of town on business.
        Maybe your mom was a very unhappy
        woman.

                SIDNEY
        If they were having an affair how come
        that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

                TATUM
        You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's
        a rumor.

                SIDNEY
        Created by that little tabloid twit Gale
        Weathers.

                TATUM
            (delicately)
        It goes further back, Sid. There's been
        talk about other men.

                SIDNEY
        And you believe it?

                TATUM
        Well...you can only hear that Richard
        Gere-gerbil story so many times before
you have to start believing it.

A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.  She stands up
and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the
neighborhood.

                SIDNEY
        If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still
        out there.

                TATUM
        Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to
        sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.
        Don't freak yourself out--we've got a
        long night ahead of us.

                SIDNEY
        You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore
        me.

                TATUM
        Come on, let's rock.

Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands across the street, under a tree.  His presence
so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second
time to know he was there all along.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LATER

Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next
to him.

                BILLY
        How'd you do?

                STU
        Piece of cake. She'll be there.

                BILLY
        Thanks, butt wart. You did good.

                STU
        So you gonna try and make up with Sid?

                BILLY
        Duh...that's quick.

                STU
        I was just asking. Why are you always at
        me?

                BILLY
        Because I'm trying to build your self-
        esteem. You're far too sensitive.

                STU
        Oh....

Billy thumbs Stu's forehead.

                BILLY
        You ready to party hard tonight?

                STU
        You know it.

They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main
Street.  A huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local
bank and post office combined. The sign in front reads
BLOCKBUSTER.

INT.  BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS

You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.  Randy, in his
Blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears--
knocking the videos out of his hand.

                STU
        Jesus, this place is packed.

                RANDY
            (picking up videos)
        We had a run in the mass murder section.

                STU
        You coming tonight?

                RANDY
        Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.
            (looking off)
        Now that's poor taste.

                STU
        What?

Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO
GIRLS.  (The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)

                RANDY
        If you were the only suspect in a
        senseless bloodbath would you be standing
        in the horror section?

                STU
        It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't
        do anything.

                RANDY
        You're such a little lap dog. He's got
        killer printed all over his forehead.

                STU
        The why'd the police let him go?

                RANDY
        Because, obviously they don't watch
        enough movies. This is standard horror
        movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.

                STU
        Why would he want to kill his own
        girlfriend?

                RANDY
        There's always some stupid bullshit
        reason to kill your girlfriend. That's
        the beauty of it all. Simplicity.
        Besides, if it's too complicated you lose
        your target audience.

                STU
        So what's his reason?

                RANDY
        Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

                STU
        She's saving herself for you.

                RANDY
        Could be. Now that Billy's tried to
        mutilate her, you think Sid would go out
        with me?

                STU
        I think her father did it. How come they
        can't find his ass?

                RANDY
        Because he's probably dead. His body
        will come popping out in the last reel
        somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police
        are always off track with this shit, if they'd
        watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.
        There's formula to it. A very simple one.
        Everyone's always a suspect--the father,
        the principal, the town derelict...

                STU
        Which is you...

                RANDY
        So while they're off investigating a dead
        end, Billy, who's been written off as a
        suspect, is busy planning his next
        hunting expedition.

                BILLY
            (o.c.)
        How do we know you're not the killer?

Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted.

                RANDY
        Uh...hi, Billy.

                BILLY
        Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's
        reality button?

Randy shrugs, laughing it off.

                RANDY
        You're absolutely right. I'm the first
        to admit it. If this were a scary movie,
        I'd be the prime suspect.

                STU
        And what would be your motive?

                RANDY
        It's 1995--motives are incidental.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost
dark.  The street is close to deserted.

INT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum
while Sid stares out the window.

                DEWEY
        A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.

                TATUM
        Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a
        little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.

Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a
few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.

                SIDNEY
        God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN
        THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

                DEWEY
        Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout
        some killer in Texas.

                TATUM
        Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a
        movie about you. Who's gonna play you?

                SIDNEY
        Oh, god...

Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police
station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile.

                DEWEY
        I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

                SIDNEY
        Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd
        cast Tori Spelling.

EXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

They pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station.

                DEWEY
        I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go
        far.

The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the
street.

                SIDNEY
        Is Billy going to be there tonight?

                TATUM
        He better not be. I told Stu to keep his
        mouth shut. I think we can live without
        EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for
        one night.

They approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum
grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the
cart through two sliding glass doors.

A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up
from counting money.

                CHECK OUT LADY
        You girls gonna have to hurry it up.
        We're under curfew.

                TATUM
        Two minutes tops.

They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the
automated doors slide shut behind them and a...

GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just
outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in,
hurriedly.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?

                DEWEY
        Keeping my eye on Sidney.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real
        bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls
        were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's
        father. He made the calls with his cellular
        phone. It's confirmed.

                DEWEY
        Couldn't his cellular number have been
        cloned?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?
        The anniversary of his wife's death. It all
        fits. He's our man.

                DEWEY
        Have you contacted the bureau?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        They believe he's out of state by now.
        We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in
        effect through the night. If he's not
        picked up by morning--we'll do a house
        to house.

                DEWEY
        You think he could still be in town?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?

                DEWEY
        She's with my sister. Should I bring her
        in?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hold off for now. Just stay close to
        her.

                DEWEY
        She'll be with her friends over at Stu
        Maker's tonight.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your
        eyes out.

                DEWEY
        Yes, sir.

INT.  SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.  The
store is completely empty.  The girls gab freely.

                SIDNEY
        Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I
        just can't relax.

                TATUM
        You have a few intimacy issues as a
        result of your mother's untimely death.
        It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.

                SIDNEY
        But he's been so patient with me, Tatum.
        You know, with all the sex stuff. How
        many guys would put up with a girlfriend
        who's sexually anorexic?

                TATUM
        Billy and his penis don't deserve you.

Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.  Down the aisle,
through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands
watching their every move.

EXT.  SUPERMARKET

Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it.
The GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found.

                SIDNEY
        What do you think about when you're
        having sex?

                TATUM
        With Stu, there's little time to stop and
        reflect. But sometimes before, to relax
        and get in the mood, I think about Grant
        Goodeve.

Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street.

                SIDNEY
        Who?

                TATUM
        Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on
        EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He
        was the one who lived off alone. He would come
        around every now and then with his guitar and
        sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."
        He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot
        brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I
        was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show
        came on every day after school right during my
        puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental
        in my maturing as a woman.

                SIDNEY
        How does that get you in the mood with
        Stu?

                TATUM
        During foreplay, I sing the theme song to
        myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives
        with love..." It's a real turn on.

                SIDNEY
        No way.

                TATUM
        Grant wrote the song himself. I'm
        convinced the lyrics had a secret
        meaning, "Eight is enough..."

Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep.  Tatum hops off.

                SIDNEY
        What secret meaning? Like a Satanical
        thing?

                TATUM
        Watch the show, Sid. His basket is
        bigger than the one you're pushing.

                SIDNEY
        TATUM!

                TATUM
        Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits
        til he's dead but the minute you mention
        an eight inch weenie. Watch out.

Sidney stops just short of a laugh.  Tatum pulls the back jeep
door, loading the groceries in.  Behind her, the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open
back door.

                TATUM
        There's that sense of humor. I knew it
        still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some
        fun tonight.

                SIDNEY
        Deal.

Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from
behind...

DEWEY stands.  Sid jumps, startled.

                DEWEY
        You girls ready.

                SIDNEY
        Yeah.

                DEWEY
        Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard
        tonight, Sid.

                TATUM
        No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.

                DEWEY
        Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the
        way, I promise.

                TATUM
        Shit.

Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.  It rolls
down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack
into the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one
hand.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road.  Headlights
illuminate the thick woods that line each side.  Following behind
them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan.

Dewey comes to the end of the road.  It dead ends at...

STU'S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with
no neighbors in sight.  A huge old home just ripe for a night of
fun and...terror.

From the looks of things the party has already started.  Music is
BLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

A big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking,
cutting up.  A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the
clock killer coverage.

Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them.

                TATUM
        Caterer's here.

The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an
enormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink
drinking beer through a funnel.

                TATUM
        That's mature.

                STU
        Where you guys been? We had to start
        without you.

EXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD

The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the
road a few feet down from the front yard.

INT.  NEWSVAN

Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a
control panel complete with video monitors.

                KENNY
        What's the plan?

                GALE
        Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a
        window and tape all of tonight's
        festivities.

Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He
checks its battery pack.

                KENNY
        The control board's glitched. You know
        we can't carry a live picture.

                GALE
        What's the delay?

                KENNY
        About thirty seconds.

                GALE
        As long as it records I don't give a
        shit. We're not doing a remote.

Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness,
not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her
shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find...

Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.

                DEWEY
        Evening, ma'am.

                GALE
        Deputy...good evening.

                DEWEY
        What brings you out to these parts?

                GALE
        You never know when or where a story will
        break.

                DEWEY
        Not much story here. Just a bunch of
        kids cutting loose.

                GALE
        Then what are you doing here?

                DEWEY
        Keeping an eye on things. Checking the
        place out.

                GALE
        Mind if I join you?

Dewey considers for a whole two seconds.

                DEWEY
        Not at all.

Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and
throws it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink.

INT.  KITCHEN

CLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO
REVEAL...

Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk
food feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst
them.  He carries an armful of videos.

                RANDY
        I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER
        night.

He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and
Tatum dive in.

                STU
        I thought everything was checked out.

                RANDY
        I had 'em hid in the foreign section.

Sidney peruses the videos.

                SIDNEY
        THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT
        --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these
        movies?

                RANDY
        She's the Scream Queen.

                STU
        With that set of lungs--she should be.

                TATUM
            (to Sid)
        Tits--see.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER

The party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit,
lean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television.
Randy is taking a vote.

                RANDY
        How many EVIL DEAD'S?
            (hands go up)
        How many HELLRAISER'S?

Hands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc.

The doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it.

                STU
        I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're
        in the fridge in the garage.

                TATUM
        What am I? The beer wench?

                STU
            (o.c.)
        Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick
        from INSIDE STORY?

They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the
foyer.

                TATUM
        Shit, Dewey!

Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale.

                TATUM
        What is she doing here?

                DEWEY
        She's with me. I just wanted to check on
        things.

The GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.  Including Stu.

                TATUM
        So you did--now leave...and take your
        media muff with you.

Tatum takes off for the kitchen.

Gale has quickly become the focus of the party.  All eyes are on
her.

                SOME TEEN
        I watch your show regularly.

                STU
        This must be big news to be on INSIDE
        STORY.

                GALE
        Huge.

                ANOTHER TEEN
        Wanna interview us?

                RANDY
        We could be like two grief stricken
        students and we'll say really nice things
        about our good friends who were
        slaughtered senselessly.

                STU
        I can cry on cue.

Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television.

                GALE
        Maybe later?

Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH.

                GALE
        Can I trouble you for some water?

                STU
        How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a
        beer.

                RANDY
        You get it.

Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds
it behind her...waiting for the right moment.

BACK IN FOYER

                SIDNEY
        Have they found my father?

                DEWEY
        Afraid not.

                SIDNEY
        Should I be worried?

                DEWEY
        Not yet.

INT.  KITCHEN

Tatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl,
then pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then
remembers...

She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the...

INT.  GARAGE

The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage.
Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch.

She finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage
door starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it
closes.

She finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead
comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving
pockets of shadows along the wall.

Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it,
not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her,
sealing her off from the rest of the house.

Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light
casts a glow across her face.

CRASH-BOOM!

Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape
through a large pet door that's built into the garage door.  She
smiles at her jumpiness.

Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads
back to the kitchen.

At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob.
It's locked.

                TATUM
        SHIT!

She KICKS it with her foot several times.

                TATUM
        Hey, Shitheads!

A moment.  No answer.

                TATUM
        OH, SHIT PISS!

Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button.
BRRRMM!  It begins to rise.

She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR-
BRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down,
closing.

                TATUM
        What the...

Tatum spins around to see..

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE

Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the
switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes.

                TATUM
        Is that you, Randy? Cute.

The FIGURE stares at her, blankly.

                TATUM
        And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON
        YOUR GARAGE.

Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE.

                TATUM
        Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll
        flip.

The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side.

                TATUM
        Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

The FIGURE slowly nods.

                TATUM
        Can I be the helpless victim?

The FIGURE slowly nods again.

                TATUM
        Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill
        me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the
        sequel."

Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too,
blocking her.

                TATUM
        Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and
cuts her off.

Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with
the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside.

                TATUM
        Randy--will you stop?

But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist
hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...

                TATUM
        You little shit.

Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver
catches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as
it darts forward, cutting into her forearm...

Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.

The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers
backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,
SCREAMING.

                TATUM
        Who are you?

The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping
back against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she
rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face,
sending him backwards, reeling.

Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS
and PULLS
on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's
recovering...

She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for
it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso
just as the...

FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy
SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through.

EXT.  GARAGE DOOR

Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS
wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side...

A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the
FIGURE, knocking him away.

She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she
stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens
but hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And
then...

CRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise
upward, taking
Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY.

                TATUM
        NOOOOOOOO.....

Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free
herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...

She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage
rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly.

INT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER

It's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door,
muttering, "parents and curfew", etc.  The door hangs open wide.
Sid moves to close it when....

BILLY appears in a classic fake scare.

                SIDNEY
        Billy? Jesus, you scared me.

Stu appears.

                STU
            (with a wink)
        Dude. What are you doing here?

                BILLY
        I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

                SIDNEY
        If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood.

                STU
        You guys can go up to my parents room?
        To talk and...whatever.

                BILLY
        Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.

                SIDNEY
        It's okay. We need to talk.

Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.  Randy appears
from the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear
upstairs.

                RANDY
        What's Leatherface doing here?

                STU
        He came to make up.

                RANDY
        There goes my chance with Sid.

                STU
        Like you had one.

INT.  NEWSVAN

Kenny fidgets at the control board.  He hits a coupla buttons,
bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living
room.  The camera is positioned just above the television...

ON SCREEN

The party is in full swing.  Several TEENS sit right in front of
the television.  Because of the camera's position they appear to
be staring right into the lens.

Suddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in.

                KENNY
        Got a picture. Perfect placement. We
        can see everything.

Gale is ecstatic.

                GALE
        Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid
        journalist ever won the Pulitzer?

INT.  BEDROOM

A large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a
balcony.

Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.  Awkward.

                SIDNEY
        So...

                BILLY
        So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit
        and I'm sorry.

                SIDNEY
        No, Billy. I'm the one who's been
        selfish and self-absorbed with all of my
        post traumatic stress.

                BILLY
        You lost your mom...

                SIDNEY
        But you're right--enough is enough. I
        can't wallow in the grief process forever
        and I can't keep lying to myself about
        who my mom was.

Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.

                SIDNEY
        I think in some weird analytical,
        psychological bullshit way I'm scared
        I'm gonna turn out just like her, you
        know? Like the bad seed or something...

                BILLY
        Oh Sidney...

                SIDNEY
        Everytime I get close to you I see my
        mom. I know it doesn't make sense.

                BILLY
        Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in
        SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she
        kept having flashbacks of her dead father.

                SIDNEY
        But this is life. This isn't a movie.

                BILLY
        Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's
        one great big movie. Only you can't
        pick your genre.

Billy moves to her.  They embrace, tenderly.

                SIDNEY
        I wanna let go. I do...

                BILLY
        Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I
        promise.

Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long
and hard.  She breaks away passionately, out of breath.

                SIDNEY
        Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

Billy nibbles her neck.

                BILLY
        Sshh..it's okay.

                SIDNEY
        Or even a good porno.

                BILLY
            (shocked)
        What?

She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.

                SIDNEY
        You heard me.

                BILLY
            (incredulous)
        Are you serious?

                SIDNEY
            (surprising herself)
        Yeah...I think so.

They smile at each other.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks,
completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several
TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards.

                TEEN #1
        Look, here it comes. SPLAT!

                TEEN #2
        The blood's not the right color. Why do
        they do that? It's too red.

                RANDY
        Here comes another...

                TEEN #3
        Predictable. Knew he was going to bite
        it.

                BORED TEEN
        How can you watch this shit over and
        over?

                RANDY
        Shhhhh.

                STU
        I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do
        we see Jamie Lee's breasts?

                RANDY
        Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie
        Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.
        She didn't show her tits until she went legit.

                BOY TEEN
        No way.

                RANDY
        That's why she always lived. Only
        virgins can outsmart the killer in the
        big chase scene in the end. Don't you
        know the rules?

Stu finishes his beer.

                STU
        What rules?

Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of
the television, explaining.

                RANDY
        There are certain rules that one must
        abide by in order to successfully survive
        a horror movie. For instance: 1. You
        can never have sex. The minute you get a
        little nookie--you're as good as gone.
        Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink
        or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an
        extension of number one. And 3. Never,
        ever, ever, under any circumstances, say
        "I'll be right back."

                STU
        Wanna another beer?

                RANDY
        Yeah.

                STU
        I'll be right back.

Everybody "ooohhs".

                RANDY
        There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave
        bye-bye.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some

A RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley
standing, his face all smiles.

                DEWEY
        Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check
        out a possible lead. Thought you might
        like to join me.

                GALE
        What kind of lead?

                DEWEY
        A car was spotted in the bushes a little
        ways up the road.

                GALE
        I'd love to. If you're sure it's
        alright?

                DEWEY
        Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

                GALE
        Can I bring Kenny?

                DEWEY
            (too quickly)
        NO! I mean...I should probably take just
        you.

Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny.

                GALE
        I'll be back.

She slides the van door closed.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep.

                DEWEY
        Actually, I thought we could walk. It's
        not far.

Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She's genuinely
smitten by this young guy.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards
in front of the television.

                RANDY
            (pointing to TV)
        Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.

                OTHER GUYS
        Beautiful! Finally!

INT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head
buried in her neck.

                SIDNEY
            (to herself)
        "Eight is enough to fill our lives with
        love..."

It's working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt
over her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the...

CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid's bra straps slide
of her shoulders...

Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off,
Blocking Sidney from view.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone
RINGS.  Everyone ignores it.  It RINGS again.

Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.

                RANDY
        Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.

Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses
the movie, the others protest
"Hey, Put is back..." etc.

                RANDY
        Listen up. They found Principal Himbry
        dead. He was gutted and hung from the
        goal post on the football field.

This stills the room.  Complete silence as the news sinks in.  ON
different faces...a moment of devastation..disbelief.  And then:

                TEEN #1
        So what are we waiting for?

                TEEN #2
        Let's get over there before they pry him
        down.

And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the
door..HOOTIN' and HOLLERIN' ...leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in
the living room.  He returns to the movie.

                RANDY
        We were just getting to the good part.

INT.  NEWSVAN - MINUTES LATER

Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time
ago.  He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears
SCREAMING from outside.  He peers out the window to see the last
of the PARTY KIDS pile into two cars and race off down the road.

He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.

INT.  BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing
respectively.  That post-sex awkwardness.

Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone
on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses
her face.  She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on
his shoes.

                SIDNEY
        Who did you call?

                BILLY
        What?

                SIDNEY
        When you're arrested-you're allowed one
        phone call? Who did you call?

                BILLY
        I called my dad.

                SIDNEY
        No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw
        him.

                BILLY
        Yeah...and when I called no one answered.

                SIDNEY
        Uh-huh.

                BILLY
        You don't still think it was me?

                SIDNEY
        No, but if it were you, that would have
        been a very clever way to throw me off
        track. Using your one phone call to call
        me so I wouldn't think it was you.

Billy stands up.

                BILLY
        What do I have to do to prove to you I'm
        not a killer?

He makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant,
from the open balcony doors comes...

THE GHOST FIGURE

Sidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.  Billy tries to
calm her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.

                SIDNEY
        BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!

Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air.
It strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the
air.

ON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife
is thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a
fight..but it's useless...he never had a chance.  His body falls
to the floor..lifeless.

ANGLE ON GHOST

as he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly
turning his attention to...

SIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.  And only when the
GHOST takes a step forward does Sidney break.  She takes off like
a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.

INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's
blood.

ANGLE ON THE GHOST

as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.  She pulls
away from him...her shirt ripping down the back.

Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door
open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.

INT.  DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Total darkness.  Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch.
The doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN
from it's hinges...and then...

NOTHING.  All goes silent.  Only Sidney's rapid BREATHING fills
the space around her.

Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she
finds a string.  She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on
overhead.

She's in a small box of a room.  The door is on one side, a small,
narrow staircase on the other.  She eyes the doorknob, then the
staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision.  There's no
fucking way she's going up to the attic.

She unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she
pushes on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She
turns to the staircase.

EXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS

A long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single
flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale
and Dewey can be heard.

                GALE
        So is Dewey your real name?

                DEWEY
        Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck
        with a long time ago.

                GALE
        I like it. It's... sexy.

                DEWEY
        Nah... it's just this town's way of not
        taking me serious.

                GALE
        What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a
        meteorologist...

CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side-
flirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous.

                GALE
        People treat me like the Antichrist of
        television journalism.

                DEWEY
        I don't think you're so bad.

Gale smiles.

                GALE
        Are all the local boys as sweet as you?

Dewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear
behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come
racing right at them.

Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars
speed by, oblivious to them.

IN THE DITCH

Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a
glance in her eyes before rolling off her.

                DEWEY
        You okay?

Something takes Gale's attention.

                GALE
        What's that?

Dewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and
aims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible.

                DEWEY
        Looks like a car.

Dewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight
on the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the
same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in.

                DEWEY
        Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.

                GALE
        Sidney's father?

                DEWEY
        We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.
        What the fuck is he doing here?

Dewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely
involved in the movie on the screen.

SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.

                RANDY
            (to TV)
        No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!
        Behind you!

And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He
tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches
his eye.

ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the
movie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double-
take.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still,
unmoving, knife raised.

                KENNY
        JESUS...FUCK...

The GHOST takes a silent step forward.

                KENNY
            (screaming at the monitor)
        BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!

This kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the
side door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as...

A LONG, SHARP BLADE

comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny
falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon
him.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR

just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy,
leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a
thirty second walk to the newsvan.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes,
and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window
on the front wall of the house.

Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over
that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection.
She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares
long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She
moves on, determined.

She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could
only reach it...

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.

                DEWEY
        I'll call for backup.

                GALE
        I'll get my camera.

They split up.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the
newsvan, throwing open the door.

                GALE
        Kenny! Camera! Quick!

The van is empty.

                GALE
        Kenny?

A CAR HORN goes off.  Gale spins around.  It came from the patrol
jeep in the driveway.

                GALE
            (calling out)
        Dewey?

She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey
is nowhere to be found.

                GALE
        Dewey? Where are you?

A look of pure dread comes over Gale.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the
window.  She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.

She spots Gale almost immedietely.  She SCREAMS OUT, looking for
the window latch.  But there's not one.  It doesn't open.  Sidney
starts beating on it...trying to break it...

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear
Sidney's SCREAMS three floors up.  Gale reaches for the door just
as she hears LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.  She backs
away.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

AN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty
living room as the horror movie on TV comes to it's horrifying
climax.

Randy is now gone.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the
house.  She moves back to the van...

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has found an old tennis racket.  She swings a solid
forehand at the window.

THE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS

Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and
pulling herself through the window frame.

EXT.  SIDE OF THE HOUSE

Sidney wastes no time.  She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is
gone.

Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion
of the roof onto...

THE MASTER'S BEDROOM BALCONY.

Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself,
letting herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free-
falling the rest of the way...but in a split instant...

THE GHOST APPEARS

grabbing her wrists in midair.

Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.  The GHOST
begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.

Sidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her
up...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing
herself.

SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back,
hitting hard.  She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself
upright.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale is frantic.  She starts the engine up and hits the headlights
when she discovers she can't see out of the windshield.

Gale rubs at the glass.  Sure enough, something is on the
windshield outside, blocking her sight.  Gale hits the wipers as
BLOOD SMEARS across the glass, it drips down from above.

Gale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she
looks up to see...

RANDY, staring at her madly.

                RANDY
        What's going on?

A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car
forward, into a ditch.  She hits the BRAKES.  Randy is thrown
forward, away from the van.

Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny's
face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide,
face distorted, blood everywhere.

Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse
flying off the top of the van.

Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly,
gaining speed just as...

SIDNEY APPEARS

in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling
a young Sissy Spacek.

Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van
veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side,
sliding off into the thick foliage.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers
through the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody.

SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the
patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.

INT.  JEEP

Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just
then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the
front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness,
undetectable.

Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the
house, revealing...

DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

                SIDNEY
        DEWEY!

Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body,
slumped, knees buckled...

And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the
porch hard.  Standing behind him is...

THE GHOST

SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She
reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits.

And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling
with something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he
holds...

THE KEYS

They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying
this...

Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the
door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it
impossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the
glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE.

She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST
DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.

Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over
her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.

Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers
side door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down.

A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The
lock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it
down, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is
certifiable.

Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the
mouthpiece and hits the switch.

                SIDNEY
        Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house
        on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA
        KILL ME!

EXT.  FRONT OF JEEP

ANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police
band.  She doesn't see the...

GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl
in behind her.

The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck.

Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the
GHOST.

She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.

Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she
pulls...

The door swings open...

Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings
herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see
nothing...

THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.

Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone.
Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where...

DEWEY'S BODY LAY

Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and
grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her...

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Sidney!

She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone
cold sober.

                RANDY
        Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.

Sidney throws the gun forward.

                SIDNEY
        Stop. Right there.

                RANDY
        Don't shoot. It's me.

                SIDNEY
        Don't come any closer.

                RANDY
        Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's
        dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did
        it.

He takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Don't believe him, Sid.

Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.

                STU
        He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.

Stu moves closer to Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        Stay away.

She aims the gun in his direction.

                STU
        His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.
        He's gone psycho.

                RANDY
        Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the
        one.

Sidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.  She aims the
gun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu...

                STU
        Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.

                RANDY
        No, Sid.

They both move toward her.  There's no time.  She must act now.
Finally...

                SIDNEY
        Fuck you both.

And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the
front door shut.

INT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Sid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear
Randy SCREAMING.

                RANDY
        NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...
        HE'S GONE CRAZY.

His fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the
darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she
reaches for it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She
SCREAMS, yanking it up.

                SIDNEY
        Please! God! Help me!

                VOICE
            (from the phone)
        Having fun Sidney?

Sidney falls apart, SCREAMING.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOOOOO!!!

She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.

Sid moves back to the door.  RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She
eyes the lock, deliberating.

                SIDNEY
            (at the door)
        GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!

CLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS.

Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED
to see...

BILLY

emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much
alive.

                SIDNEY
        Oh God. Billy!

He's blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing,
grabbing him, holding him...

                SIDNEY
        I thought you were...

                BILLY
        I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.

Billy goes for the door.

                SIDNEY
        He's out there.

Randy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS
LUNGS.

                RANDY
            (through door)
        Please, you gotta let me in. He's
        gonna kill me.

Billy goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him.

                SIDNEY
        NO! Don't believe him.

                BILLY
        It's okay. Give me the gun.

Sidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door,
opening it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...

                RANDY
        Help me...

                BILLY
            (calming him)
        Shhhh. It's okay.

                RANDY
        Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.

Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face.

                BILLY
        "We all go a little mad sometimes."

Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls
the trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall
before sliding to a heap on the floor...still.

                BILLY
        Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO

BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...

Who stands only feet away, face aghast...

Fuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her,
unmoving.

He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his
face...tasting it.

                BILLY
        Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for
        pig's blood in CARRIE.

Sidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into
the dark refines of the kitchen.

Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes
another step back--petrified.

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There
is something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is
pure evil.

She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.

THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline
of a FIGURE appears...

STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.

She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...

STU

Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.

                SIDNEY
        Stu...please...help me...

Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile
as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.

                STU
            (whispering into phone)
        Surprise, Sidney.

His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.

Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It
becomes all too clear.

She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...

SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

If for no other reason than to put space between her and
them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.

                BILLY
        Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've
        got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's
        your turn.

                STU
        Oh yeah

Stu disappears into the kitchen.

                BILLY
            (to Sidney)
        What's wrong? You look like you've seen
        a ghost.

Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.

A NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu
reappears from the front hall...wrestling with
something...someone...

CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it
rolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find...

HER FATHER

bound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.

                SIDNEY
        Daddy!

She starts for him.

                BILLY
        Close enough.

Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket.

                STU
        Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.

                SIDNEY
        Why are you doing this?

                STU
        It's all part of the game.

                BILLY
        It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

                SIDNEY
        Fuck you.

                BILLY
        We already played that game. You lost,
        remember?

                STU
        You have to play, Sid. Don't want to
        disappoint your dad. He's been waiting
        around all night.

                BILLY
        It's an easy game. We ask you a
        question. If you get it wrong--you die.

                STU
        And if you get it right--you die.

                SIDNEY
        You're crazy--both of you.

                STU
        The official term is "psychotic".

                SIDNEY
        You'll never get away with this.

                BILLY
        Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't
        believe how easy it was to frame him.

                STU
        Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took
        a few notes. It was fun.

Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.

Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.  She looks
back to Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.

                SIDNEY
        Why did you kill my mother?

                BILLY
        Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I
        think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't
        really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did
        Norman Bates have a motive?

Stu plays along, shaking his head.

                STU
        Nope.

                BILLY
        And did they really ever explain why
        Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
        Don't think so. You see, it's scarier
        when there's no motive, Sid.

                SIDNEY
            (fighting tears)
        I don't understand...

                BILLY
        We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman
        was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit
        all over town like she was Sharon Stone or
        something.

                STU
            (laughing)
        ..so we put her out of her misery. I
        mean, let's face it, your mom was no
        Sharon Stone.

Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.

                BILLY
        Is that motive enough for you? Or how
        about this? Did you know your slut
        mother was sleeping with my dad and she's
        the reason my mom moved out and deserted
        me.

A sudden silence.  Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant
with truth.

                SIDNEY
        What?

Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness.

                BILLY
        Think about it. On the off chance I get
        caught-a motive like that could divide a
        jury for years, don't you think?. You took
        my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy
        factor. Maternal abandonment causes
        serious deviant behavior. It certainly
        fucked you up. It made you have sex with
        a psychopath.

                STU
        That's right and now that you're no
        longer a virgin. You gotta die--those
        are the rules.

Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.  And then
moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.

                BILLY
        Pretend this is all just a scary movie,
        Sid. How do you think it's going to end?

Sidney doesn't respond.

                STU
            (excited)
        This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got
        it all figured out. Why do you think we
        kept your father alive so long? Why did
        we save you for last?

                BILLY
        You know what time it is, Sid? It's
        after midnight. It's your mother's
        anniversary. We killed her exactly one
        year ago today.

Billy turns to Stu with the knife.  They eye each other.

                BILLY
        Ready?

                STU
        Yeah...

Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing
into Stu.  He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.

                STU
        Jesus...

Sidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red.
Stu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...

                STU
        Good one. My turn.

He takes the knife from Billy.

                BILLY
        Don't forget-stay to the side and don't
        go too deep.

Stu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...

                BILLY
        Jesus...fuck, that hurt.

                SIDNEY
        Stop it!

                BILLY
            (squelching the pain)
        Got the ending figured out yet? Time's
        running out.

                STU
        Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your
        father is the chief suspect. We cloned
        his cellular. The evidence is there.

Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick
cuts...he doubles over...

                BILLY
        What if your father snapped? Your mom's
        anniversary set him off and he went on a
        murder spree, killing everyone...

                STU
            (in major pain)
        Except for me and Billy...we were left
        for dead...

                BILLY
        And then he killed you and then shoots
        himself in the head. It's a perfect
        ending.

                STU
        Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on
        and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these
        days--you gotta have a sequel.

Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.

                SIDNEY
        You sick fucks--you've seen one too many
        movies.

Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.

                BILLY
        Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies
        don't create psychos. Movies just make
        psychos more creative.

Stu staggers a bit.

                STU
        That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.
        I'm feeling woozy.

                BILLY
        Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.

Billy moves to Sidney's father.

                STU
        Where'd you put it?

Stu is searching the foyer for the gun.

                BILLY
        It's on the table.

                STU
        No, it's not.

Billy hobbles over.  The gun is gone.

                BILLY
        Where the fuck is it?

                VOICE
            (off camera)
        Right here, asshole.

Billy and Stu look up in unison to see...

GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY

standing in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered
and bloody.  Her hair a mess.

                BILLY
        I thought she was dead.

                STU
        She looked dead. Still does.

Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.

                GALE
        I've got an ending for you. The reporter
        left for dead in the newsvan comes to,
        stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the
        gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.

Sidney steps forward.

                SIDNEY
        I like that ending.

Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye
each other.

                BILLY
        She can't get both of us.

                STU
        Odds are--she'll miss anyway.

In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She
pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.

Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING
IT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out
the door.  She goes down...out.

                STU
        Cool move.

Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where
Gale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find...

SIDNEY GONE.

                BILLY
        Where'd she go?

Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has
completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains
in the living.

                STU
        I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.

                BILLY
        Where the fuck did she go?

Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other.
Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone.

                BILLY
            (picking up phone)
        Hello?

                SIDNEY
            (from phone)
        Are you alone in the house?

Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone.

                BILLY
        You bitch--where the fuck are you?

                SIDNEY
        Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little
        game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST
        CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED
        YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

Billy looks around the living room.

                BILLY
        Find her.

Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose
it.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.

                BILLY
        FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!

                STU
        I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut
        to deep.

Billy throws the phone at Stu.  He mouths to him, so Sid can't
hear.  "Talk to her..."  Then Billy takes off for the kitchen.
Stu takes the phone.

                SIDNEY
            (aware)
        So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got
        one. The police are on their way. What
        are you going to tell them?

                STU
        Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.

Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.  He's
completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.

                BILLY
            (SCREAMING in phone)
        I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like
        your slut whore mother.

                SIDNEY
        Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed
        Mama's boy.

Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad
fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet.  Touche!  He smiles
deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the
sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles
back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella
lodges in his chest, and he goes down.

Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.  She looks at Billy,
disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body.  A
movement behind her sends her reeling around to find...

RANDY slowly sitting up.  His body drenched in blood.  He's
alive...barely.  He looks to Sidney...through pain...

                RANDY
        You know what I hate most about horror
        movies? The final scene...it just goes on
        and on...and it gets so stupid...

Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him,
completely unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall
back into the living room.  Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and
turns to the living room to find...

Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting,
both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...

HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the
floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...

ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's
got...

Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold
of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out
of Stu's clutch...

His hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it,
gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING
the VCR into Stu's head.  Stu drops.

ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound.  He
CRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER.  Her other hand brings the gun up to his
face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash
of silver appears above Sidney.

Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above
Sidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER
striking Billy knocking him back into the living room.

Sidney looks up to see...

GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises
above the gun's chamber.

Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes
meet.  A life truce.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head.  Sid and Gale move over
them, staring down.  Randy joins them.

                RANDY
        Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.
        And pretty happy about it right now.

Sidney nudges their bodies.  They both stir.

                RANDY
        Careful. This is the moment when you
        think the killer's dead, but then he
        springs back to life for one last scare.

Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.

                SIDNEY
        Not this time.

She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.

                SIDNEY
        This is for my Mom, asshole.

She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.  The she
aims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at
her, blood bubbling from his lips.  He's not yet dead.  Their eyes
lock.

                SIDNEY
        And this Billy stud-bucket is for having
        an incredibly small weenie.

She FIRES another perfect shot.  They're both goners.

Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.  A
quiet moment when suddenly...

A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM

Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare
proportions as Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.

Sid catches her breath, relaxing.

                SIDNEY
        Oh Daddy...

She rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase
and retrieves the hidden camera.

                GALE
        I wanna close-up.

Randy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father.

                RANDY
        This is probably an inappropriate
        moment, but you think you'd want
        to maybe go out with me sometime...
        like on a date?

Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.

                RANDY
        Maybe catch a movie?

A long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation
to the slight trace of a smile.

                SIDNEY
        Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.

                RANDY
        You got it.

He smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father,
holding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one
hell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE.

                                               FADE IN:
   
   
   EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
   
   An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in
   a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front
   reads:
   
   "SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT
   'STAB'
   Rated R"
   
   A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS -
   mostly college age.
   
   CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly
   face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her
   boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate scary movies.
   
                       PHIL
             It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your
             hand.
   
                       MAUREEN
             If we hurry, we can still catch the
             Sandra Bullock movie.
   
                       PHIL
             We got free tickets.
   
   He pulls her close, snuggling with her.
   
   
   EXT. BOX OFFICE
   
   Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their
   tickets.
   
   They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands
   randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation
   of a most familiar one. Phil takes one.
   
                       MAUREEN
             What's that?
   
                       USHER
             The studio sent them.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER
   
   The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen
   and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two
   seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a
   GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS.
   Everyone is having fun.
   
   Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the
   screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in
   terror. A very lively crowd.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo
   appears followed by...
   
   "A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM"
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil
   has slipped it on.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I don't think so.
   
   Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Take it off.
   
                       PHIL
             But...
   
                       MAUREEN

   More credits.
   
   "BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE
   WEATHERS"
   
   Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the
   audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre.
   The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A
   chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
   Lights burn from within.
   
   Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
   taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile
   body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the
   curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Now why does she have to be naked?
             How does that serve the plot?
   
                       PHIL
             Sssshhh.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower
   curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She
   grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living
   room, grabbing the phone.
   
                       GIRL
             Hello?
   
   A menacing VOICE responds.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen is not having a good time. She's already
   spooked.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate this shit.
   
                       ON SCREEN
             The phone rings again.
   
                       VOICE
             Why did you hang up on me?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen shifts in her seat.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she just hang up and
             call the police? Stupid..
   
                       PHIL
             Shush.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
   
   He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
   
   Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small
   lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long
   hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow
   points downstairs.
   
   Maureen hits the stairs to...
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME
   
   A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low
   lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for
   the...
   
   
   INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME
   
   A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door
   CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall.
   
   
   INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
   
   Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the
   bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
   are heard. Loud and heavy.
   
   Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
   visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
   stop.
   
   Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
   stall door open and rushes out to find...
   
   THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
   
   The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
   door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
   
   A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
   loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.
   
                       GIRL #l
             I got so scared my bladder rolled.
   
                       GIRL #2
             You chicken shit. It's just a
             movie.
   
                       GIRL # l
             No, it really happened. It's a true
             story.
   
   Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked.
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME
   
   Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE
   emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE
   appearing behind her...
   
   LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She
   SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask
   comes off. It's Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You ass.
   
                       PHIL
             I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.
             It was too easy.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You are so not funny.
   
   Phil takes her in his arms.
   
                       PHIL
             Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,
             will ya?
   
                       MAUREEN
             I get scared really easy, okay.
   
                       PHIL
             You gotta go with it. Scary movies
             are great foreplay.
   
   He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her.
   She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I just have a hard time with
             insipid, sexist violence.
   
                       PHIL
                   (nibbling her neck)
             We can still Sandra Bullock it.
   
                       MAUREEN
                   (nibbling back)
             Sandra started without us. We can
             stay. He kisses her again, then
             breaks away.
   
                       PHIL.
             Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me
             upstairs?
   
                       MAUREEN
             Want some popcorn?
   
                       PHIL
             Butter.
   
   Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,
   reaching for the bathroom door just as a...
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
   back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
   forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
   and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
   strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
   
   Maureen is at the concession. A GIRL at the counter
   hands her change and Maureen is off with soda and a tub
   of popcorn.
   
   
   INT. DARK THEATER - SECONDS LATER
   
   SCREAMS and GASPS from the audience as the movie plays
   on.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The
   young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING,
   flying through the room.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to
   the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."
   etc.
   
   Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
   down next to...
   
   
   PHIL
   
   Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
   movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Give it up.
   
   She sits down, with the popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             How many stabs did I miss?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl slips out a side door, completely
   terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen offers Phil popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she run?
   
   Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked
   lips, SSSHHING her.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
   MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
   the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
   away, running...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her
   best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her
   popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             This is so tired.
   
   She turns her attention to Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Hey, you... pasty face...
   
   Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
   putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
   Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your
             ghost?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost
   Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she
   SCREAMS...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
   continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
   ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
   screen.
   
   She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
   knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
   up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
   something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
   her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
   fingers.
   
   Maureen stares at her hand...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
   pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
   The young girl is helpless...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
   first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
   Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
   one clutching the hunting knife.
   
   Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
   SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
   SCREAM at the screen.
   
   
   ON SCREAM
   
   The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
   striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
   the aisle as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
   herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
   her... raising his knife again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
   clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
   to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
   see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
   
   Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
   PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
   the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is slashed again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The knife slices into Maureen again... then again. The
   theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
   keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
   horrifying, sickening sight.
   
   Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down
   to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
   audience begins...
   
   
   APPLAUD AND CHEER
   
   Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
   and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
   SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
   last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
   Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very
   much dead. Her arms flail across the screen... smearing
   blood over the wide screen image of the GHOST MASK.
   
                                               SMASH CUT

   INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   A typical college dorm room. Industrial strength
   furniture. There's two of everything.
   
   A RINGING phone stirs a YOUNG GIRL in bed, asleep under
   a mound of blankets and pillows. The girl starts to
   rise as the phone is answered. A VOICE is heard. Brass
   and sassy.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Hello... uh-huh... Who is this?
             Well, we identify ourselves around
             here. No, you can't. Uh-huh...
             yeah, right...
   
   The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to
   reveal her face - It's SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Two years older
   has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman.
   Her face posses a survivor's edge. Stronger and more
   determined, she appears to have weathered the storm.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I got it.
   
   She stands and moves to...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Her roommate and friend. An attractive young black
   woman. Twenty at most. Brazen. Fun. Full of life. She
   hands the phone to Sidney.
   
                       HALLIE
             Knock yourself out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
                   (silence)
             Hello?
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting.
   Sidney doesn't flinch.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yes?
   
                       VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She
   takes a look at its display.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cory Gillis. 442-8730.
   
   Silence.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls
             are a criminal offense prosecuted
             under penal code 653M...
   
   CLICK! The phone goes dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Enjoy the movie.
   
   She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie.
   
                       HALLIE
             Time to change numbers again?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Nah... I think it'll die off. It's
             opening weekend. Let's see how it
             goes.
   
   Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie
   channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on
   their small TV. Snippets are heard.
   
                       REPORTER
                   (from TV)
             "... The two victims, Maureen Evans
             and Phil Stevens..."
   
   The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed.
   Attractive, sullen. Sad.
   
                       YOUNG MAN
                   (from TV)
             Please, I just wanna be left alone.
   
   His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the
   television.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sure gives a lot of interviews
             for someone who wants to be left
             alone.
   
   Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as
   the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles.
   
                       HALLIE
             Get your ass in gear. You're late.
             Don't forget we've got rush at the
             Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything
             you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid?
   
   Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost.
   Recovery is immediate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I can't believe I let you talk me
             into going Greek.
   
   Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST
   FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops
   herself.
   
   It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to
   scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to
   Hallie, throwing the costume at her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?
   
   Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door,
   leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands.
   
                       CUT TO:
             
   
   EXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER
   
   Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines
   down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as
   FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER.
   
                       REPORTER #2
             Sidney, did you know the victims?
   
                       REPORTER #1
             Do you feel responsible for the
             murders?
   
                       SIDNEY
             What murders?
   
   Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged
   upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to
   panic.
   
                       REPORTER #3
             Do you think there will be more
             murders?
   
   Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is
   no escape. The questions come at her like lightning.
   She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a
   REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick
   sunglasses, moves in her way.
   
                       FLASHY REPORTER
             Did you kill them last night, Sid?
             Has it gotten to you? Have you
             finally snapped?
   
   Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when...
   
   BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the
   crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She
   drops. Sid spins around to find...
   
   
   GALE WEATHERS
   
   Standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick
   moment. Sidney is happy to see her.
   
   The onslaught continues. Cameras flash, reporters
   shove. Gale moves in front of Sid, holding the crowd at
   bay. The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale.
   
                       GALE
                   (to Sid)
             Quick, get outta here.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on?
   
                       GALE
             Just go. l'll find you later.
   
   Sid wastes no time. She takes off, running around the
   side of the building. She stops, takes a breath, but
   the reporters are on her tail. She looks up to see a...
   
   
   SMALL CAMPUS SECURITY VEHICLE
   
   Appear, moving towards her. It slows down.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
                   (from the vehicle)
             Hop on, Sid.
   
   Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her. One
   smooth move and Sidney is in the arms of...
   
   
   DEWEY RILEY
   
   She looks at him. Her face a book of questions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on, Dewey?
   
   He smiles at her. A safe, warm smile. His face as cute
   as ever.
   
                       DEWEY
             It'll be alright.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. SECURITY CART - MINUTES LATER
   
   The security cart trots along, passing STUDENTS coming
   and going. Dressed smartly in a campus security outfit,
   Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds.
   Sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to
   him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Three hundred people watched?
             Nobody did anything?
   
                       DEWEY
             They thought it was a publicity
             stunt.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God. How could it happen?
   
                       DEWEY
             They don't know. It was carefully
             planned. Earlier in the day the
             victims received anonymous passes
             to the movie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's a copycat killer I knew this
             would happen. That fucking movie.
   
   The cart comes to a stop in front of a building.
   
                       DEWEY
             As of now, they don't see any
             relation. But they're checking it
             out. The state, Special Task Force,
             FBI - they're all here. They'll
             find the guy.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
                       DEWEY
             Look, Sid, why don't you take off?
             Disappear for a few days. I'll come
             with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. I will not crawl under a rock.
             This is a fucked-up world and
             people kill people all the time.
             I'll just get used to it.
   
   Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid
   off.
   
                       DEWEY
             Nothing will happen to you. I
             promise.
   
   Sid's tough demeanor is cracking. She takes a deep
   breath.
   
                       DEWEY
             That's why I'm here, right? We take
             care of each other. C'mon, I'll
             walk you to class.
   
   He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is
   visible as his left leg drags behind him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You go, it's all stairs, I can take
             it from here.
   
                       DEWEY
             Don't worry...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, I'm completely equipped with
             mace, alarm whistle, keyring,
             knife, a degree in defensive
             combat...
   
                       DEWEY
             Just in case...
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be
             okay. Go back to work and let me
             get back to my quasi pseudo-happy
             existence.
   
   Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss,
   then takes off for the building. Dewey watches until
   she disappears inside, then limps back to his security
   cart.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. STUDENT UNION PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
   
   A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other
   newsvans and REPORTERS. Some are doing live remotes,
   others ready themselves for the next onslaught.
   
   Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to
   her ear.
   
                       GALE
             I don't know... no one's talking.
             What's the studio's position? Never
             happen. They'd be stupid to pull
             the movie. With all this free press
             - they're gonna have huge numbers
             this weekend. It'll break box
             office records. Of course I have
             bumps.
   
   Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van
   fussing with equipment.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             I need two minutes at six o'clock.
             I wanna do a piece on the slain
             kids - no sympathy shit - let's
             stick with the movie angle. I wanna
             pull a clip from an old film...
   
   Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hey, what was the name of that
             movie?
   
   The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older
   but still the charming jokester.
   
                       RANDY
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA.
             1980. Tom Hanks' first film.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find
             it. Don't worry, I've got it
             covered... I have a plan. Yeah,
             I'll get it. Give it a rest - I
             said I'll get it. Later.
   
   She hangs up, turning to Randy.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Pressure's on. You ready for this?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm there, man. No worries. I got
             ya covered. I'm so there. That's
             why I'm here - because I'm there.
   
   Randy holds up his camera - stoked.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER
   
   Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school
   building. Through open doorways, film equipment is
   glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film
   Department.
   
   She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room,
   a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.
   
   
   INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
   
   Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful
   of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in
   discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
   whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
   point.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels are too handicapped. By
             definition alone, they're inferior
             films.
   
   Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic,
   cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped.
   
                       MICKEY
             Bullshit generalization. Many
             sequels have surpassed their
             original.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Name one.
   
                       MICKEY
             ALIENS Far better than the
             original.
   
                       ANOTHER GUY
             Subjective.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             Life's subjective. I much prefer
             Ridley Scott.
   
   The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making
   their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN.
   
                       HALLIE
             No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away
             from her - you bitch."
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             I'll give you that one. Name
             another.
   
                       MICKEY
             T2.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             A bigger budget does not make a
             better movie. TERMINATOR one is
             historical.
   
   Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the
   TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             How about THE GODFATHER PART II?
   
   Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in
   agreement.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The almighty exception. Name
             another.
   
   A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the
   conversation. His name is Derek.
   
                       DEREK
             EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.
             Improved effects.
   
   From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated.
   
                       HALLIE
             I liked JEDI. With the furry
             things.
   
   Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow."
   
                       MICKEY
             Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH,
             PART 20.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Case in point. The entire horror
             genre was destroyed by sequels.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             Really? And why do you think that
             is?
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes
             about: money and no one's
             interested in quality.
   
                       DEREK
             It's more than that. Horror films
             are only as good as their villains.
             How can Freddie and Jason possibly
             be scary after they've been diluted
             through five or six sequels.
   
                       TEACHER
             What's the solution? If you were
             making a sequel today what would
             you do differently?
   
   The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney
   in the back of the room. She gives a half wave. He
   starts for her, excusing himself.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The point is - I made my point.
             Sequels suck.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek
   throws his arms around her protectively.
   
                       DEREK
             How are you? You weren't in class.
             I called as soon as I heard...
   
                       SIDNEY
             I skipped. Too many "That's her"
             looks.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't ask what you can do. No
             coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
   
   He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
   
                       DEREK
             I can do that. And I can also do
             this.
   
   He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
   her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No PDA.
   
   But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
   they're soon devouring each other like two people in
   love. Right in the middle of the hallway.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   The place is a circus. The front steps of the student
   center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium
   and mike have been placed center.
   
   CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is
   being held by the university. Reporters and cameras
   have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER,
   a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to
   spectators.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
                   (reading from a
                   prepared statement)
             "... and we feel this unfortunate
             isolated tragedy in no way reflects
             upon our fine school and we should
             trust that the authorities and FBI
             are acting quickly to bring us
             answers..."
   
   Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI
   AGENTS. She continues on...
   
   
   IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION
   
   Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
   
                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
             Gale? Can I have a second?
   
   Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy
   reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of
   her.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I'm sorry about the face.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -
             NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
   
                       GALE
             Fair enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             What are you doing here? I thought
             you had retired from field
             reporting?
   
   The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
   TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
   CAMERAS are on Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Well, you know I'm dear to the
             subject matter.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And much richer as a result.
   
                       GALE
             Do I know you? You look familiar.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I took your vulture seminar seminar
             at Berkeley last year.
   
                       GALE
             Good for you.
   
   And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
   Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
   forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
   copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.
   
                       GALE
                   (ever smooth)
             Guys, you're missing the show.
   
   And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is
   fielding questions.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we have no evidence of a serial
             killer. We think the killer acted
             deliberately and not at random...
   
   
   ON THE LAWN
   
   Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are
   Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand
   JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very
   intelligent face.
   
                       DEREK
             But what are they doing? He's
             talking but he's not saying
             anything.
   
                       JOEL
             Sounds like they don't know
             anything.
   
                       HALLIE
             Do you think they'll cancel Hell
             Week?
   
                       MICKEY
             You're getting nailed - you're not
             getting out of it.
   
   From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
   LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
   BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
   Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
   
                       JOEL
             Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             This has nothing to do with me,
             Joel. There's an estimated 270
             serial killers currently active in
             the US at any given time. I can't
             control that. Who's hungry?
   
                       HALLIE
             I have rehearsal.
   
                       MICKEY
             I have to watch rehearsal.
   
   Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid.
   
                       JOEL
             I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.
             Some of us have real majors. You
             gonna be okay, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not allowed to ask that.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks, Joel.
   
   Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls,
   Lois and Murphy saunter over.
   
                       LOIS
             Hello, pledges. Enjoying
             yourselves?
   
   Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins
   begrudgingly.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.
             Thank you for asking.
   
                       MURPHY
             Good. We need your help, pledges.
             Are you familiar with the Deltas TP
             fundraiser?
   
   The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois
   withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag
   and passes them out.
   
                       LOIS (CONT'D)
             In our efforts to raise money for
             our favorite cause...
   
                       MURPHY
             ... this week's TKE kegger...
   
                       LOIS
             Ne ask that you sell individual
             squares of toilet paper for a mere
             nickel a piece.
   
                       MURPHY
             We've set you each at a five dollar
             quota.
   
                       MICKEY
             Come on, guys. Uncool.
   
                       MURPHY
             Am I getting fraternity
             interference, Mickey?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. I can peddle toilet
             paper.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid, you don't have to.
   
   Sidney takes her toilet paper.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No special treatment. I can do
             this. C'mon Hallie.
   
   She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with
   this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you put up with this Greek
             shit?
   
                       MICKEY
             Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it,
             I'm into Hallie...
   
                       ACROSS THE WAY
             Gale moves through the crowd as the
             press conference/rally continues.
             She runs dead smack into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between
   them is revealing.
   
                       GALE
             Hello, Dwight.
   
                       DEWEY
             Miss Weathers.
   
                       GALE
             I've been trying to reach you but
             you haven't returned...
   
                       DEWEY
             I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers,
             excuse me.
   
   He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him.
   
                       GALE
             The name's Gale, remember'?
   
   He turns on her. His eyes on fire.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is
             embedded clearly between my ears.
   
                       GALE
             I see you read the book.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, I do retain reading skills.
             Shock.
   
                       GALE
             And an explanation is, of course,
             out of the question.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the
             room with his dim-witted Barney
             Fifish presence." I think you've
             explained yourself.
   
                       GALE
             Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, what you are is a money hungry,
             fame- seeking liar and - forgive me
             for saying - mediocre writer who
             has a cold storage shed where her
             heart should be.
   
   This stings Gale.
   
                       GALE
             You have every right to be upset.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with
             inexperience."
   
                       GALE
             I never meant to imply...
   
                       DEWEY
             How do you know my dim-witted
             inexperience isn't merely a subtle
             form of manipulation used to lower
             people's expectations thereby
             enhancing my ability to effectively
             maneuver within any given
             situation?
   
   Gale is at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry. I don't know what else
             to say except I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, I'm the one who's sorry. I
             misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse
             me, I have some oozing to do.
   
   Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after
   him. Her face smashed fiat.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The sheriff continues fielding questions from
   reporters.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, there has been no evidence that
             more than one killer is
             responsible...
   
   
   ACROSS THE WAY
   
   Sidney and Hallie have split up. They move through the
   crowd selling toilet paper. Several STUDENTS make their
   purchase.
   
   Sidney pockets her change, looks up to see Gale,
   standing alone. She goes to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello, Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney. Hello. How are you?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't
             stop calling but other than that...
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, well... you are the
             definition of mixed emotions. I
             really should hate you... I see
             your movie's getting good reviews.
   
                       GALE
             It seems to be causing a stir.
             What's with the toilet paper?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's hell week. I'm pledging the
             Deltas.
   
                       GALE
             It's good to see you involved.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My morn was a Delta.
   
   Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them
   talking. Reporters and spectators have slowly circled
   them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears
   behind Sid, with his camera. Gale gives him the nod. He
   throws the camera up, hits the light.
   
   Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Randy? What are you doing here?
   
   But then she sees someone else, standing off to the
   side. A man she recognizes immediately. He looks at;
   her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Cotton...
   
   He moves to her.
   
                       COTTON
             Hello, Sidney.
   
   Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
   them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
   him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
   the camera directly at her... filming her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What are you doing?
   
   She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
   realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.
   She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale.
   Eyes aflame.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             You BITCH!
   
   Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton
   turns to Gale. His face pained.
   
                       COTTON
             This was a mistake. I shouldn't be
             here.
   
   He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops
   filming.
   
                       RANDY
             Can you say backfire?
   
                       GALE
             Did you get it?
   
                       RANDY
             Yeah, I got it.
   
   Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's
   in his voice.
   
                       GALE
             You need to check your conscience
             at the door. We're not here to be
             loved.
   
   Randy's face reveals otherwise.
   
                       AT THE PODIUM
             The sheriff continues.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we don't anticipate another
             murder but we are taking every
             precaution possible...
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT
   
   A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large
   old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place.
   Welcome to Sorority Row.
   
   
   INT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
   
   A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several
   sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl
   who lies on the couch watching television. This is
   CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She
   channel surfs while talking on the phone.
   
                       CICI
                   (on phone)
             No, they broke up again. Bailey
             won't stop drinking and Sarah can't
             take it anymore.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (from phone)
             Thought he was doing AA.
   
                       CICI
             No, he quit - the whole God thing -
             he has issues. The previews for
             next week...
   
   BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Hold up... someone's calling. (she
             clicks over) Chi Omega House.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello.
   
   A MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring.
   
                       CICI
             Yes.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Who is this?
   
                       CICI
             Cici. Who's this?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Someone who wants to talk to you.
   
                       CICI
             Ted? Where are you? Are you
             drinking? Hold on.
   
   She clicks back over.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Teddy's on the other line. He
             sounds drunk. I'll call you back.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That shit. He only calls you when
             he's drunk. Don't go over there.
   
                       CICI
             I won't.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Don't. Think Bailey.
   
                       CICI
             Alright, alright... I'll call you
             back.
   
   She clicks back over.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's
             up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Who's Ted?
   
   Realizing, it's not Ted.
   
                       CICI
             Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought
             you were someone else.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's okay.
   
                       CICI
             Who do you want to speak with?
             Nobody's here.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Where is everybody?
   
                       CICI
             We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain
             mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Why aren't you there?
   
                       CICI
             I'm designated driver. I have to be
             here in case a sister calls and
             needs a ride.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's too bad.
   
                       CICI
             "Drink with your brain." That's our
             motto. Who are you calling for?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What if I said you?
   
                       CICI
             What if I said goodbye?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Why would you wanna do that?
   
                       CICI
             Why do you always answer a question
             with a question?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm inquisitive.
   
                       CICI
             I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna
             leave a message for someone?
   
   Silence. No response.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Hello? Hello? Where'd you go?
   
   Silence again. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ?
   
   Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces
   Cici. Her eyes widen. BEEP! Call waiting CLICKS
   through.
   
                       CICI
             Just a second.
                   (clicks over)
             Yes?
   
   Cici gets up and moves to...
   
   
   INT. FOYER - SAME
   
   Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Was it Teddy?
   
                       CICI
             No, some creep asshole trying to
             scare me.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             It's hell week. Chill. The movie
             murders have brought out the
             crazies. It's nothing.
   
   BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the
   staircase.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             What is it?
   
                       CICI
             I heard a noise.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Where?
   
                       CICi
             Upstairs.
   
   BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like
   footsteps.
   
                       CICI
             Shit. Cici moves to the staircase.
             She peers up it.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
                   (calling out)
             Hello? Hello?
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   ( la Friday the 13th)
             Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah,
             hah, hah...
   
                       CICI
             Stop it...
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             I can't believe you're alone in
             that house.
   
   Cici looks up the staircase again.
   
                       CICI
                   (soft whisper)
             I don't think I'm alone.
   
   Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks.
   
                       CICI
             I'm outta here.
   
   She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open.
   She moves out onto the...
   
   
   EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands
   on the porch steps, looking back, through the open
   door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             You're breaking up. Where are you?
   
                       CICI
             Outside.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That's smart.
   
   Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks
   along the sidewalk.
   
                       CICI
                   (calling out to him)
             Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0?
   
   The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat.
   He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a
   sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within.
   People come and go.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             There's something going on at the
             Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down.
   
   Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone
   begins to CRACK severely.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (phone begins to go
                   out)
             Don't do that. Hang up... call...
                   (static)
   
                       CICI
             What? I can't hear you...
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (major static)
             Hang up... call...
   
                       CICI
             I'm losing you.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             ... campus security... send
             someone... check out... place...
   
                       CICI
             Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll
             call you back.
   
   Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the "TALK" button.
   Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a
   dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She
   hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the
   porch steps.
   
   She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She
   moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major
   static. She dials 511.
   
                       VOICE
                   (major static)
             Campus Security.
   
                       CICI
             Hello, I'm calling from the Chi
             Omega...
   
                       VOICE
                   (too much static)
             I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello?
   
   Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it.
   
                       CICA (CONT'D)
             Can you hear me now?
   
                       VOICE
             We... bad..connec... call back.
   
   The phone goes dead.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
   Cici redials. The same static.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello?
   
                       CICI

                       VOICE
             I can't hear you.
   
   Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's
   completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The
   connection becomes much clearer.
   
                       CICI
             I'm calling from the Chi Omega
             house. Someone is harassing me.
             Hello?
   
   There's no one on the line.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS
   HER.
   
   Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER.
   
                       GIRL'S VOICE
             Did the phone ring?
   
   Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre-
   occupied.
   
                       CICI
             Jesus, you scared me. What are you
             doing here?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I live here.
   
                       CICI
             I thought you were going to the
             mixer?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I had to change. Did anyone call?
   
                       CICI
             Just some asshole trying to scare
             me.
   
   The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici
   stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Are you okay?
   
   Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from
   the receiver.
   
                       CICI
             Hello?
   
                       DRUNK GIRL
                   (from phone)
             We need a ride. Taxi! Taxi!
   
                       CICI
             Where are you?
   
                       DRUNK GIRL
                   (from phone)
             We're at Grogs and need a ride to
             Acid Rain.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who is it? Is it Tina?
   
                       CICI
             They're at Grogs.
   
   Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room.
   She moves to a mirror and fusses with her hair.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way.
             Cici follows her back into the
             living room.
   
                       CICI
             I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
   
   Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Take the next one. You should set
             the alarm. There's a killer on the
             loose.
   
   Reflected through the mirror is the foyer. Neither see
   as a SHROUDED FIGURE appears through the front door.
   Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the Figure
   sweeps into the dark dining room and out of sight.
   
   Dawnie starts back for the front door. The phone RINGS.
   
   Dawnie grabs it.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Is Cici there?
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who's calling?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Ted?
   
   Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             It's your ill-concieved boyfriend.
             Seeya later. Set the alarm.
   
   She SLAMS the door shut behind her. A second later we
   hear it lock. Dawnie brings the phone up to her ear.
   
                       CICI
             Hello? Ted?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, it's me.
   
   Cici nearly collapses. She's starting to lose it.
   
                       CICI
             WHAAAATT?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Don't forget to set the alarm.
   
   Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room. She
   moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is
   positioned in the wail. She hits a coupla digits and a
   BEEP is heard as she activates the alarm.
   
   She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she
   turns and moves into the...
   
   
   DARK DINING ROOM
   
   Cici finds the light switch. CLICK! The room is
   illuminated. Two long dining tables run the length of
   the room. It's empty. Void of the Figure.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens
   it, She gives it the once over. The frig light reflects
   against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not
   seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back.
   
   Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the
   backyard. She checks the lock. Secure. Then, the phone
   RINGS.
   
   She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby
   wall. It RINGS AGAIN. She reaches for it, answering it.
   
                       CICI
             Hello?
   
   
   SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS
   
   One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair,
   wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around,
   shoving her, pushing her into the...
   
   
   SLIDING GLASS DOOR
   
   Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's
   body crashes through it, setting off the ALARM. A loud,
   shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's body
   lands on the deck outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES
   REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
   
   Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home
   serves as the Delta Zeta sorority. MUSIC PLAYS from
   inside. It sounds like a party.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people.
   SORORITY GIRLS and FRAT BOYS who SCREAM and CHEER as
   they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands
   behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring
   plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped
   cream.
   
   Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear
   into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up,
   making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie,
   coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate.
   
   A whistle BLOWS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Looks like we have a winner.
   
   Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her
   face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Sidney gets to skip the next round
             of Bulimia bingo.
   
   Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             You bitch.
   
   They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands
   wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek
   enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He
   hurries over.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where have you been'? You missed my
             shining moment. I won the macaroni
             sundae binge.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
   
   
   ON HALLIE AND MICKEY
   
   Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face.
   
                       MICKEY
             I don't want you to choke or
             anything but you're trailing. You
             need to pick the pace up.
   
   She swats him.
   
   
   ON SID AND DEREK
   
   Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (complete throw away)
             Any news?
   
                       DEREK
             About what?
   
                       SIDNEY
             The forbidden subject.
   
   He shakes his head.
   
   Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room.
   
                       FRAT BOY
             Yo, guys, outside. Something's up
             at the Chi Omega. Police are
             everywhere.
   
   People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front
   door. Sidney looks to Derek.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into
   the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING.
   
   
   ANGLE ON STREET
   
   Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with
   police, ambulances, reporters...
   
   "Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd
   takes off in droves down the street. All except for...
   
   
   SIDNEY AND DEREK
   
   They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes
   a circus.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   She knows.
   
   
   INT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is
   crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking
   things out.
   
   
   IN THE KITCHEN
   
   Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered
   glass door.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Lots of blood. But no body.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Have you checked the...
   
                       SHERIFF
             Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Take the neighborhood.
   
   The Sheriff turns to his men.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Alright men, listen up...
   
   Dewey is all ears.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her.
   Her face is numb.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's starting all over again.
   
                       DEREK
             Lemme take you home.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll get my jacket.
   
   Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door,
   back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from
   what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching
   the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat
   when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...
   knowingly... she reaches for it.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello Sidney?
   
   The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes.
   When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she
   refuses to crack.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Soon, Sidney, soon.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             To see every ounce of blood drain
             from your body.
   
   The Voice has never sounded more evil... more
   seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Then come and get me.
   
   And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it
   down. Silence. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             My pleasure.
   
   The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her.
   Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
   
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE
   
   But not the one from the movie theater. The one from
   Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer
   archway, staring at her.
   
   A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.
   But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,
   steel hunting knife... blood stained.
   
   
   SIDNEY BOLTS
   
   As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
   
   
   ON THE PORCH
   
   Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He
   finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid? Sid?
   
   
   IN THE LIVING ROOM
   
   Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's
   blade. She bolts through the living room, to the front
   door. Derek beats on it from outside.
   
   
   IN THE FOYER
   
                       SIDNEY
             Derek. He's in the house. Help...
             me...
   
   She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,
   the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,
   thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
   
   
   INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
   
   Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He
   moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.
   He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the
   kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot
   back and kicks in the window.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She
   struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind
   her. She barely makes it out the back door...
   
   
   EXT. BACK YARD - SAME
   
   A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid
   flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves
   across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed
   fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind
   her to find...
   
   
   NOTHING
   
   She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely
   disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind
   it.
   
   Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind
   the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for
   the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
   
   BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still
   making her way around the tree, moving backwards,
   walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning
   around, finding herself face to face with...
   
   
   CICI'S BODY
   
   Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a
   ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE
   HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms
   of...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   She turns, SCREAMING.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
   
   He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she
   holds on for dear life.
   
   
   EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING
   
   The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and
   joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly
   comes to life.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The local campus security office has been converted
   into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS
   stand guard outside while inside...
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The place is packed. No longer just a campus security
   office. The place has been converted to the local
   police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS
   and SUITS swarm the place.
   
   In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and
   Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean
   Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night
   for all.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We don't know if it's random. We
             haven't been able to connect the
             victims.
   
                       SHERIFF
             The first two were stabbed without
             thought. The sorority girl was
             gutted with autopsy precision.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Christ! Just do something. I will
             not have a repeat of Gainesville.
             Not on my campus. .
   
   Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping
   forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sidney Prescott, sir.
   
   They both turn to him.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             She's the connection.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We know that, son.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer was trying to get to
             her. That sorority girl was a
             distraction.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're aware of that.
   
   Sheriff Hartley steps forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer is obviously repeating
             Woodsboro. I can fill you in on
             what I know.
   
   Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain
   Tyler pulls Dewey aside.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Look, son. I know you've lived
             through this, but we got it under
             control. Why don't you have some
             coffee?
   
   Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by
   TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The
   FBI and local police fawn over her.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming
             in.
   
                       GALE
             Of course, what can I do?
   
   Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the
   back, sending him off.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We were hoping you could help with
             the killer's profile.
   
   Dewey's face couldn't be more burned.
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER
   
   A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written
   on it under the label "Victims" - "MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL
   STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR"
   
   Gale is at the chalk board
   
                       GALE
             Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott.
             Sidney Prescott's mother. The first
             victim in the Woodsboro Murders.
             Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the
             first kid to be murdered. Ten to
             one - Cici is not the third
             victim's real name.
   
                       SHERIFF
             It's Cassandra.
   
                       GALE
             Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The
             third victim in Woodsboro. She was
             hung from a tree and gutted.
   
   The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the
   room. His eyes burning holes into Gale.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Jesus...
   
                       GALE
             This is a complete copycat. Your
             killer is even going in sequence.
   
   Captain Tyler sits up.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Who was the next victim in
             Woodsboro?
   
                       GALE
             In the book or in the movie?
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Let's try reality.
   
                       GALE
             Mr. Himbry - the principal was the
             next victim. However, in the movie
             version, Tatum Riley was killed
             next. Dramatic license.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies
             out of his seat and into action.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
                   (to his men)
             Find me every variation of Himbry
             and what was the other name...
   
                       DEWEY
             Tatum Riley.
   
   Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire
   room stares at him, knowingly. Gale's eyes find his. He
   looks away.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Both on campus and the surrounding
             community. I want names ASAP.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             I'll get you full access.
   
   The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action.
   Gale stops Captain Tyler.
   
                       GALE
             What about Sidney? Is she safe?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             She's completely insulated. I've
             got my top men on her.

   INT. SIDNEY ' S DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among
   pillows and blankets. The remains of a sleepover. Joel
   parts the blinds.
   
   
   ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
   
   Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about
   outside - standing guard.
   
                       JOEL
             How many guys they have on you?
   
                       MICKEY
             I counted four.
   
   Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             Okay, you're sure about skipping
             Calculas?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, I have the perfect excuse.
   
                       HALLIE
             What about rehearsal?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gotta.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'll cover you through rehearsal.
             Derek when do you get outta docu-
             drama?
   
                       DEREK
             Two.
   
                       HALLIE
             So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
   
                       DEREK
             And watch her til 8:00 - I've got
             to edit.
   
                       JOEL
             Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio
             and we can grab a bite.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
   
                       HALLIE
             Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take
             her late evening.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
   
                       HALLIE
             Too bad.
   
                       SIDNEY
             This is exactly what I don't want.
   
                       DEREK
             I think it's out of your control.
   
   Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close.
   Mickey and Hallie argue about this evening. Joel moves
   out the door.
   
                       JOEL
             Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But...
   
   Derek kisses her sweetly.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My screwed up life shouldn't have
             to bleed onto my friends.
   
                       DEREK
             Let us decide that.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What about your film? Isn't it due
             next week? Have you even started
             it?
   
                       DEREK
             It's under control.
   
   He kisses her again.

   INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER
   
   A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open
   floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book
   store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place.
   
   Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie
   Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not
   fast enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hi, Gale, any leads?
   
                       GALE
             Tons and tons.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where is Sidney's father?
   
                       GALE
             Home - where he lives.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And are the police sure about that?
   
                       GALE
             Why don't you ask them?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Already did. He's the perfect
             suspect, don't you think?
   
                       GALE
             No, I don't.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Parents are always responsible. It
             all starts in the home.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I know you kinda hold me up
             as your career template and it
             gives you some anal charge to
             challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm
             not interested in the scoop
             anymore. Excuse me.
   
   Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The
   tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines
   about the murders dominate the newsrack.
   
   Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone
   RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello, Gale.
   
   It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable.
   
                       GALE
             Who is this?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'll give you one guess.
   
   Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A
   CAMPUS COP is across the lobby.
   
                       GALE
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's not the way we play the
             game.
   
                       GALE
             I don't play games.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What if your life depended on it?
   
   Gale gets testy with him.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You're pretty when you're angry.
   
   Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive
   with people. He could be anywhere.
   
                       GALE
             Where are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm everywhere.
   
   She continues moving to the Campus Cop.
   
                       GALE
             Oh - a God complex
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Stay away from the cop.
   
   A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She
   looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over
   a balcony.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want from me?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             It's what you want from me.
   
   Silence.
   
                       GALE
             What do you mean?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You are writing another book,
             aren't you? That's why you're here.
             The story's not over.
   
                       GALE
             You're getting obvious.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, Gale, I'm just getting started.
             Seeya soon.
   
                       GALE
             No, wait...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Watch your back.
   
   CLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing
   quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She
   turns and heads off, right into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   They both GASP.

   INT. CAMPUS THEATRE - DAY
   
   A large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but
   preserved and updated. A rehearsal is in progress.
   SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running lines as
   stagehands work on the set around them.
   
   Sidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very
   animated. More alive than ever. She dons a Russian
   accent. Convincing. A promising actress.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (in character)
             "Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."
   
   An awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other.
   Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up.
   
                       LOIS
             That's not the line. You jumped.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Shit. Did I?
   
                       LOIS
             About a page.
   
                       DIRECTOR
                   (off stage)
             CUT! Let's take five.
   
   The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across
   a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra
   pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie
   sits watching. Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting
   scattered about.
   
                       HALLIE
             That was good.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
   The DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly.
   
                       DIRECTOR
             Sid, why don't you get outta here?
             We'll pick this up tomorrow.
   
   Sid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her.
   
                       DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
             Work on the accent.
   
   She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when...
   
                       VOICE
             Sid?
   
   Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had
   been watching rehearsal. Sid's face tenses.
   
                       HALLIE
             Who is that guy?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet
             you outside.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, girletta, I don't leave your
             side.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I've got my entourage. Take a
             break. Please.
   
   Sid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the
   aisle, against her better wishes.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never
             should have gone along with Gale. I
             know I'm stupid. I wish I had some
             good reason to give you but I'm
             just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be
             mad at me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Do you work for her now?
   
                       RANDY
             Well, yeah... she gave me a job.
             Freelance. It got me outta
             Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton
             and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I
             knew it was a bad idea but it
             seemed like a quasi harmless bad
             idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up.
   
   Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly
   appearing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Me, too. Randy. Me too.
   
   He nods, knowingly.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Wanna get outta here?

             I can do it, Captain.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking
             I'd pull Jesse off...
   
                       GALE
             I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.
   
   Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids
   Gale's stare.

             it. That's just the way the cookie
             crumbles. Moms leave.
   
                       TORI
             Yeah, but your mom left town. She's
             not dead. My mom's dead. Do you
             hear me? She's dead. Dead. And
             she's never coming back. Ever,
             Ever.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Sidney grows increasingly uneasy.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. STUDENT CAFETERIA - LATER
   
   Mickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in
   the Student Union Cafeteria.
   
                       DEREK
             My documentary is due on Tuesday.
   
                       MICKEY
             What's your subject?
   
                       DEREK
             I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
   
                       JOEL
             You should of done it on Sidney.
             That would have been a cool.
   
                       DEREK
             She wouldn't let me.
   
                       MICKEY
             Not with Primetime Live and 20/20
             coming at her. I'd save my shit
             too.
   
   Hallie comes waltzing up.
   
                       DEREK
             Where's Sid?
   
                       HALLIE
             Damned if I know. She ditched me.
   
                       DEREK
             You weren't supposed to leave her
             alone.
   
                       HALLIE
             I didn't say she was alone. That
             guy - from her home town showed up.
             They went off together.
   
   Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss.
   
                       MICKEY
             I've been waiting for you, baby.
   
                       JOEL
             Is that cool? Just to leave her
             like that?
   
                       HALLIE
             She's got guards with her.
   
                       DEREK
             What guy?
   
                       HALLIE
             Randy somebody.
   
                       JOEL
             Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that
             night in Woodsboro.
   
                       MICKEY
             Her old boyfriend?
   
                       JOEL
             No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy
             was a friend.
   
                       MICKEY
             Watch out, Derek.
   
                       HALLIE
             He tried to kill her first.
   
                       MICKEY
             Is Sid in therapy?
   
                       JOEL
             She was for a while. Gave it up.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you know so much about her?
   
                       JOEL
             I read the book.
   
                       MICKEY
             I could use some therapy.
   
                       DEREK
             Should we be worried about this
             guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just
             showed up and now people are dying?
   
                       HALLIE
             He seemed harmless.
   
                       DEREK
             Aren't most serial killers
             seemingly harmless?
   
                       JOEL
             And white.
   
                       MICKEY
             Easy black boy.
   
                       JOEL
             It's documented. Most serial
             killers are attractive - slightly
             off white males in their twenties.
   
                       HALLIE
             That's you, honey.
   
   Hallie kisses Mickey again.
   
                       MICKEY
             I got a surprise for you.
   
                       HALLIE
             What?
   
   Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins
   to sing at the top of his lungs.
   
                       MICKEY
             "If I should stay. I would only be
             in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I
             know, I'll think of you each step
             of the way...
   
                       HALLIE
             Don't do this.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always
             love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will
             always love you."
   
   Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing
   with him.
   
                       JOEL
                   (to Derek)
             Whitney?
   
                       DEREK
             I think he's doing Dolly.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And I hope life treats you kind
             and I hope you have all you dreamed
             of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
   
                       DEREK
             Definitely Whitney.
   
   Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up,
   ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a
   necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle
   from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her.
   
                       JOEL
             Isn't that a big no-no?
   
                       DEREK
             I think so.
   
   Hallie breaks away. She swats him.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're going to get it. You know
             what happens.
   
                       MICKEY
             But I love you. And I want the
             whole world to know it.
   
   Hallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each
   other.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER
   
   Sid and Randy continue watching the movie. The guards
   behind them are way engrossed.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for
   her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his
   sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen.
   Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face.
   
                       TORI
             Why did you kill my mother?
   
                       JOHNNY
             Because she was sleeping with my
             dad. She's the reason my mom left.
             She was a whore just like you.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   These words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
                       TORI
             My mom was no whore. Don't you say
             that.
   
                       JOHHNY
             Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
   
   Tori starts to cry.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing
   each other.
   
                       JOHNNY (CONT'D)
             It's the perfect alibi, Sidney.
   
                       SIDEKICK
             Just like in the movies.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out
   of the theatre.
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER
   
   Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She
   moves into a curtained section where the water fountain
   is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the
   theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are
   right behind him.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her.
   shoulders slumped, his face pained.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Can we talk?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't think that's a good idea.
   
                       COTTON
             Look, yesterday wasn't my idea.
             That was all Gale and dollar signs
             and ratings.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want from me, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You could start with an apology.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I did that.
   
                       COTTON
             You wrote me a letter. Very
             cordial. Very appropriate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             How? What could I say that would
             make a difference? I took away a
             year of your life - how do I
             apologize for that?
   
                       COTTON
             I wish it was just a year. I lost
             everything because of you. I have
             nothing now. Look at me, this is
             what I've become.
   
   A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton, there isn't one day, one
             hour, one minute when I'm not
             reminded of what I've done. I have
             not had one second of reprieve and
             no therapy or religion or spiritual
             plane can ever erase what I feel in
             every vein of my being. And I wish
             I had in me what you need to hear
             but I don't think the words exist.
   
   More silence.
   
                       COTTON
             I just thought if I saw you face to
             face, maybe it would help.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Did it?
   
                       COTTON
             It helped me realize one thing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What?
   
                       COTTON
             You're a self-obsessed little cunt
             like your mother.
   
   And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns
   evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm,
   stopping her just as...
   
   
   THE TWO POLICE GUARDS
   
   Appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him
   against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's
   side.
   
                       RANDY
             You okay?
   
   Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They
   do a body search, pulling from his coat a large
   revolver. Cotton just smiles.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - LATER
   
   Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library.
   The ever helping guards behind them.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't know. I don't think Cotton
             did it. It's too predictable.
   
                       RANDY
             If he's innocent he'll have an
             alibi.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I guess Gale's going to be pissed
             she missed her exclusive.
   
                       RANDY
             I'll relay it. You sure you don't
             wanna go home?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I have this button I press. See? It
             insulates me.
   
   She mimes an air lock valve.
   
                       RANDY
             I gotta coupla of those buttons
             myself.
   
   There's something sad about this exchange. These two
   people understand each other
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks for the movie, Randy.
   
                       RANDY
             Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just
             had that been there done that
             feeling.
   
   Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across
   campus. Sid turns to find Derek leaning against a pole.
   
                       DEREK
             I had the four o'clock shift. You
             weren't there. You had us worried.
             Is everything okay?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, it's not.
   
                       DEREK
             I don't really know what happened
             in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you
             don't trust me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not you, Derek. I don't trust
             myself. I tend to make big
             selection errors when it comes to
             men.
   
                       DEREK
             Then I'll make this easy for you. I
             like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid.
             But I'm gonna stay away. Until you
             say otherwise.
   
   A long moment. He looks at her, hoping she'll say
   otherwise.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm sorry, Derek.
   
   Derek nods. So that's how it's going to be. He turns
   and wanders off, not looking back once.

   EXT. NEWSVAN - CAMPUS - LATER
   
   The newsvan is parked at a curb. It sits out of the way
   overlooking the student commons area. A grassy area
   where students sit and conjugate.
   
   Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to
   her ear. Dewey sits leans against the van, watching
   her. He still has a crush but hides it as best he can.
   
                       GALE
                   (on phone)
             The interview's not going to
             happen. 1 changed my mind. I've
             harassed the girl enough. It's in
             poor taste and a bad idea.
   
                       FROM THE PHONE
             Your entire career is in poor
             taste...
   
                       GALE
             Gotta go, call me when you have
             something nice to say.
   
   Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey. Smiles.
   
                       DEWEY
             So what made you change your mind
             about Sidney?
   
                       GALE
             Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
   
                       DEWEY
             You're a hard one to figure out.
   
                       GALE
             It's that complex yet shallow
             quality. It's deliberate.
   
                       DEWEY
             I think you're all an act.
   
                       GALE
             And deep down I'm a good person?
             Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
   
                       DEWEY
             I know that.
   
                       GALE
             Yeah?
   
                       DEWEY
             I also know that you're an aging TV

             huge tabloid success, has some self
             worth issues regarding your
             personal life which directly
             effects your professional life in a
             non-positive manner. A coupla
             failed relationships with - I'm
             guessing balding, older men - have
             turned you into this bitch with a
             cell phone. But I bet sometimes,
             late at night, when you're all
             alone a sadness seeps to the
             surface and in a moment of clarity
             you know that all you really want
             is to be touched and held and
             fondled.
   
   Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
   swirls about them.
   
                       GALE
             And where did you gain all of your
             Gale Weather's insight?
   
   Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
   with him. They stand incredibly close.
   
                       DEWEY
             After my spinal cord was damaged I
             was laid up for over a year. A lot
             can happen when you're on your
             back.
   
   They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy
   approaches.
   
                       RANDY
             What'd I miss?
   
   Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular
   phone RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy.
   
                       GALE
             I'm not here.
   
   Randy takes the phone.
   
                       RANDY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Gale?
   
                       RANDY
             She's not here right now.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             But she's standing right next to
             you.
   
   Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He
   points around campus, mouthing "He's watching." Gale
   grabs Dewey.
   
                       GALE
             C'mon.
                   (to Randy)
             Keep him talking.
   
   Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where
   STUDENTS come and go.
   
   
   ON RANDY
   
   He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?
   
                       RANDY
             So... what's your favorite scary
             movie? No response. Silence.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             They'll never find me.
   
   Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students,
   searching.
   
                       RANDY
             What do you care? Let 'em have
             their fun. So, what's up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       RANDY
             SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening.
             What's yours? Wait, let me guess.
             THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL
             EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT
             DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY?
             Am I close?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Closer than you think.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   They move through passing STUDENTS.
   
                       GALE
             He has to be nearby. He likes the
             game.
   
   Dewey is on the his walkie. "I need back-up." He has a
   hard time keeping up with Gale. He hobbles along.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.
   
                       RANDY
             So what's your deal? Can we talk
             openly for a second? How does one
             become a serial killer? Huh? Are
             you psychopathic or merely
             psychotic? And what is the
             distinguishing feature'? Were you
             slapped around as a child? Is it
             hereditary? Did your Mom take test
             drugs? You know, have you tried
             getting laid? It's done wonders for
             my homicidal tendencies.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you want to die?
   
                       RANDY
             Gee, let me think. "Do you want
             to... " Is that the best you can
             do? Some tired hand me down rehash?
             Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a
             book about you. No movie rights.
             Nothing. I've been through this
             before and much better I might add.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
   Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS.
   He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and
   rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to pounce on
   her.
   
   Dewey appears.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. C'mon, Gale.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   Randy won't let up. He continues dissing.
   
                       RANDY
             And if you're such a brilliant
             smart killer - why copycat? Why not
             be original? Where's the
             innovation? Let's pioneer some new
             ground. Make a statement. Go down
             in history. Now you'll always be
             the Woodsboro copycat killer.
             That's lame. It's like a bad
             sequel. And why Woodsboro? What
             about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam?
             Why imitate two high school loser-
             ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys.
             Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and
             Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking
             homo-repressed, mama's boy.
   
   Suddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, a GHOST MASKED
   FIGURE lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck. The move
   is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is wrenched
   back into the newsvan. The door SLAMS shut.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   As they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in
   the distant. Gale races up to find Randy nowhere.
   
                       GALE
             Randy? Randy? Where did he go?
   
   Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side
   door. She tears it open as...
   
   RANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat
   slit.
   
   Gale's SCREAM is heard all over campus.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CRIME SCENE - NEWSVAN - LATER
   
   Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan. People
   have gathered as Randy's body is taken out on a
   stretcher.
   
   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated
   faces.
   
                       SHERIFF
             He's broken his pattern.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             They've broken their pattern.
   
                       SHERIFF
             You're sure about this two person
             thing?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Broad daylight, a crowded movie
             theatre. This is too much fun for
             one person.
   
   Different UNIFORMS whirl by.
   
                       SHERIFF
             I would say we are now officially
             baffled.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             On national television.
   
   Sheriff Hartley looks up as REPORTERS flock them,
   surrounding them in questions.

   INT. LIBRARY - RESEARCH COMPUTER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   A room of the library sectioned off exclusively for
   computer use. It consists of thirty to forty cubicles
   that house computer terminals. Every cubicle is full.
   The place is packed.
   
   Sid sits at a terminal busy at work. Her two police
   guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye
   out.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY
   
   Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the
   computer screen in front of her.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts
   flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words.
   
   
   ON SIDNEY
   
   Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She
   leans back, turning to the GUY next to her. A handsome
   young man.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Excuse me? Did your computer just
             freeze?
   
   The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor.
   
                       GUY (CONT'D)
             You have an instant message, that's
             all. Just hit ALT M.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm not signed on.
   
                       GUY
             Someone here in the room. All the
             terminals are connected.
   
   The guy returns to his own computer. Sidney eyes the
   screen suspiciously. She hits ALT + M. A message pops
   up on the screen.
   
   "YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT."
   
   Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking
   about the crowded room. He could be anywhere. The two
   guards take notice, rushing over to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's here. He's in the room right
             now.
   
   She points to the screen. The men instantly break up
   and cover the room. They start pulling people from
   their terminals to check their screens.
   
   Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing.
   
   Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She
   looks around. She slowly moves toward it, drawn
   uncontrollably. She hits ALT + M. Another message pops
   up:
   
   "THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU."
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   It's stone pale. She takes a deep breath and begins to
   type.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   The words "FUCK YOU" appear. Sid hits "SEND".
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - PRIVATE OFFICE - LITTLE
   LATER
   
   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very
   subdued and cool Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             What better alibi could I have? I
             was here in custody.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Maybe you don't work alone.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah, that's it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
   
                       COTTON
             There was no attack, we were
             talking. Very heatedly. Miss
             Prescott and I have a very
             complicated past. That's no crime.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             And the gun?
   
                       COTTON
             I have a permit. It's registered. I
             have a legal right to carry it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why do you need a gun?
   
                       COTTON
             Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is
             not reason enough to hold me here.
             I've been down this road before.
             And unless you're going to charge
             me with a crime I'd like to walk
             outta here. I have an interview at
             6:00.

   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - OUTER OFFICE
   
   Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a
   hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             Where's Sidney'?
   
                       DEWEY
             She's safe.
   
   Silence.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             How you doin?
   
                       GALE
             Not good. How you doin?
   
                       DEWEY
             Not good.
   
   Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their
   office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves
   to him.
   
                       DEWEY
             Can't we hold him?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             No, we got pressure from California
             State. The man practically has
             clemency. We can't run the risk of
             falsely accusing him. He has to be
             standing over the victim with knife
             in hand before we make a move.
   
                       DEWEY
             What now?
   
   
   ON COTTON
   
   He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches.
   
                       GALE
             What's going on, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You know the story, Gale. Man
             falsely accused, sent to prison,
             proved innocent, released back into
             the real world and never trusted
             again. Want the exclusive?
   
                       GALE
             Did you do it?
   
   She looks him dead in the eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Now, Gale, you were so instrumental
             in my freedom. You're not having
             character doubts now, are you?
   
                       GALE
             You have a right to be angry.
   
                       COTTON
             No, Gale, I don't have any rights.
             You made sure of that.
   
                       GALE
             Cotton, I've done nothing but help
             you.
   
                       COTTON
             You've done nothing but get rich
             off of me. How many books have you
             sold, Gale? You think I don't
             understand points and royalties and
             ancilliary rights?
   
   Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him
   his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and
   checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun.
   
                       GALE
             Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.
             You've come to far.
   
                       COTTON
             Gale, I don't know what I'm doing
             from one moment to the next. I'm
             just taking it as it comes.
   
   Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins
   Dewey and the others.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Night's coming. I think its time to
             beef up security on the Prescott
             girl.
   
                       GALE
             Where is she?
   
                       SHERIFF
             She was just escorted to her dorm
             room.
   
                       DEWEY
             Is she safe there?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're going to bring her in. Hide
             her out for a coupla days. And
             we're issuing a campus lock-in this
             evening. No one is allowed out
             after dark.
   
                       DEWEY
             That doesn't work, sir.
   
                       GALE
             You're just isolating people.
             You're giving the killer a blank

   Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to
   deafening tunes. A row of kegs line one wall as a the

   chatty.

                       MURPHY
             ... harmonica style is okay.
   
                       LOIS
             I just love being a sister.
   
   Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up.
   
                       DEREK
             Thanks, ladies.
   
   They take off to the kegs.
   
                       MICKEY
             Are they aware of your not so
             positive portrayal of Greek life?
   
                       DEREK
             Not one bit.
   
                       MICKEY
             Where's Sid?
   
                       DEREK
             She dumped me.
   
                       MICKEY
             No way.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah.
   
                       MICKEY
             You freakin?
   
   Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of
   nowhere, SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, picking Mickey up,
   lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts CHEERING
   and CLAPPING.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             He lavaliered. He's dead.
   
   They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys
   abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight.
   Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his camera and
   bolts.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - EVENING
   
   Sidney is trying to focus on homework while Hallie
   channel surfs. She finds a channel. On screen, Siskel a
   Ebert are reviewing a movie.
   
                       EBERT
                   (from TV)
             I enjoyed its clever execution...
   
                       HALLIE
             We're missing the Sig Ep party.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties
             and mass murderers don't go
             together. Trust me.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, no, I hadn't planned on going,
             it's just Mickey will be pissed.
   
   Hallie clearly wishes she were there.
   
                       SISKEL
                   (from TV)
             It was just an excuse to kill
             young, big breasted girls. I didn't
             like it.
   
   They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels.
   There's a KNOCK on the door. Sid answers - it's Dewey
   and Gale. From the look on their faces...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Someone else has been killed.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER
   
   SPLAT! Gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air
   exploding perfectly all over...
   
   
   MICKEY
   
   Who stands buck naked, tied... chained to a tree in the
   back yard. The yard is crowded with FRAT BOYS and
   SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of
   syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged
   upon him.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             Who do you love?
   
                       MICKEY
             Hallie.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             Did you say "My TKE brothers"?
   
                       MICKEY
             No, I said Hallie.
   
   More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois
   and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous
   night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The
   crowd goes crazy.
   
   
   INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney
   is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it
   together.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm fine. I wish people would stop
             treating me like glass. I'm not
             gonna break.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's okay to break, girl. You
             shatter if you have to.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'd really just like to be alone.
   
                       DEWEY
             The police are waiting outside.
             They're going to take you somewhere
             safe.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, there's no such place.
   
                       DEWEY
             Humor me, Sid.
   
   Sidney starts packing an overnight bag.
   
                       HALLIE
             Can I come with her?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you
             down too. I'll be alright.
   
                       GALE
             Sid, I'll come with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But who would operate your camera?
   
   A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A
   KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard
   standing with Joel.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             He's cool, Remy.
   
   Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to
   Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the
   guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid.
   
                       JOEL
             They got Mickey. He's being toasted
             at the Deltas.
   
                       HALLIE
             I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over
             there.
   
                       JOEL
             We're under quarantine.
   
   He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'm the only one who can cut him
             down.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not a good idea, Hallie.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll go with her.
   
                       HALLIE
             Be safe, girl.
   
   She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she
   and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his
   head in.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sid, you should get going.
   
   He looks at Joel and Hallie.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Where are you two headed?
   
                       JOEL
                   (instant cover)
             Hallie forgot her footage at the
             film dept. I'm gonna walk her over
             before it's gets too late
   
                       DEWEY
             You really...
   
                       HALLIE
             I gotta have it, Dewey.
   
   Gale steps in.
   
                       GALE
             Hey, Dewey?
   
                       HALLIE
             Seeya, Dewey.
   
   Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more
   objections. Dewey turns to Gale.
   
                       GALE
             If you were truly a copycat,
             wouldn't you want to emulate
             everything about the killer that
             you could?
   
                       DEWEY
             Meaning?
   
                       GALE
             He's already gotta be a part of
             Sid's life. What do you know about
             this Derek?
   
                       DEWEY
             Solid alibis. He was with Sidney
             when she was attacked.
   
                       GALE
             Billy had alibis too.
   
   Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll
             find you later, okay.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Whatever.
   
   Sidney's exterior keeps hardening.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER
   
   Mickey is still tied to the tree. He's so completely
   covered in hardened gook it looks like he's wearing
   clothes. The last of the crowd has left. They've gone
   back to the party. He stands shivering in the cold.
   
   He checks the chain that holds him secure. It's
   composed of several bike locks and steel twine. He's
   not going anywhere.
   
   BUMP! He hears a noise. He looks to the nearby shrubs
   and beyond. Nothing. Just a noise of the night.
   
                       MICKEY
                   (whispering)
             Come on, Hallie, baby...
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. DEREK'S DORM ROOM - LATER
   
   A dark room. A slight disturbance at the door and it
   comes popping open. Light from the hall floods the room
   as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind
   them.
   
                       GALE
                   (checking door)
             You broke the lock.
   
                       DEWEY
             You broke my heart.
   
                       GALE
             What are we looking for?
   
                       DEWEY
             A bloody knife. A ghost mask.
             Something like that?
   
                       GALE
             Can we turn the light on?
   
                       DEWEY
             That's not the way it's done.
   
   Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the
   room. He sifts through drawers and a closet.
   
                       DEWEY
             And it's sexier in the dark.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey, you and I would never make
             it.
   
                       DEWEY
             Maybe not. But think about the sex.
             As frustrated as I am...
   
                       GALE
             ... and as lonely as I am...
   
                       DEWEY
             We'd break some furniture.
   
   Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his
   buttock.
   
                       GALE
             Tell you what. We get through this
             one. And we'll take out a hotel
             room. Over here with the light.
   
   Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of
   Joel and Derek - a buddy pose. She sifts through some
   text books on the desk.
   
                       DEWEY
             They're roomates.
   
                       GALE
             And Joel's pre-med.
   
                       DEWEY
             The sorority girl was gutted with
             autopsy precision.
   
                       GALE
             Shit! It's both of them. The first
             murders were to throw us - using
             the same names as Woodsboro. But
             they've moved on - they're getting
             closer to Sidney. They're not
             looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to
             kill. They're looking for the new
             Tatum.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hallie?
   
   A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MINUTES LATER
   
   A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus
   street.
   
   
   INT. SQUAD CAR - SAME
   
   Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers
   ride in front.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where are you taking me?
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Actually, I don't know.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #2
             We're meeting another car that will
             transport you the rest of the way.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Safety precautions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I feel like Eddie Murphy.
   
   The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             We feel like Kevin Costner.
   
   Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
   the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
   Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
   it's cut short.
   
   Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
   struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
   Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
   towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
   late. The Ghost has the door open.
   
   A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
   slit.
   
   
   IN THE BACK SEAT
   
   Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the
   car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
   
   
   IN THE FRONT SEAT
   
   The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
   gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
   car in drive and takes off down the road.
   
   Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
   sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
   door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
   and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME
   
   The car makes its way down the deserted street
   
   
   IN THE BACKSEAT
   
   Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
   the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
   Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
   She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
   by.
   
   Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
   campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
   side of a thin, road.
   
   She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
   white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
   Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
   
   Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
   She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
   pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
   No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
   grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
   is right up against it.
   
   Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
   Ghost's head, ready to attack.
   
   Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
   into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
   falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
   a moment.
   
   The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
   The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
   bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
   that stands directly in the car's path.
   
   The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
   
   Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
   rumbling.
   
   
   INSIDE THE CAR
   
   All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
   
   Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
   car. It's flush against the building.
   
   Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
   pulling on it, bending it backwards...
   
   CREAK!
   
   Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
   
   
   FRONT SEAT
   
   Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
   
   The only way out is through the driver's door.
   
   After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
   Nothing.
   
   She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
   through.
   
   She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
   for the door knob.
   
   HONK!
   
   Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
   car door open and starts to slide completely over the
   Ghost when she stops.
   
   She looks to the Ghost.
   
   
   CLOSE ON HER FACE
   
   As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
   when...
   
   
   THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
   
   Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
   the car door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE CAR
   
   BAM!
   
   Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
   
   The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
   knocking him backwards.
   
   Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
   pavement.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
   
   The film school sits in the still darkness.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY - SAME
   
   Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.
   THUMP! They stop cold.
   
                       GALE
             Ssshh! What was that?
   
                       DEWEY
             Let's find out.
   
   Dewey keeps moving.
   
                       GALE
             This is all too familiar.
   
                       DEWEY
             Over here.
   
   Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
   
   
   INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME
   
   The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
   three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
   ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
   from the ceiling in different places around the room.
   
   Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
   that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
   completely dark.
   
   They move down the first level of chairs to the
   lecturn.
   
                       GALE
             Maybe they never got here. He could
             have taken her anywhere.
   
                       DEWEY
             C'mon. Let's go.
   
   CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
   attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
   life. Images appear.
   
   
   CLOSE ON MONITOR
   
   Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
   theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
   in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
   searching for it's source.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
   video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
   reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
   girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
   phone. It's Cici.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
                       GALE
             Jesus Christ!
   
                       DEWEY
             He filmed his victims.
   
   CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
   
   It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
   cellular phone to his ear.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
   woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
   becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
   stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
   
   
   CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
                       GALE
             Shit!
   
   Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
   carries.
   
                       DEWEY
             Dammit!
   
   He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
   them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
   squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
   
                       GALE
             Let's go.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, wait here.
   
   Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
   stair rise that leads to the upper level.
   
                       GALE
             No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
   
   But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
   monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
   
   
   ON THE UPPER LEVEL
   
   Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
   He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
   the shining light.
   
   He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
   It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
   second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
   
   Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
   up to him.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey?
   
                       DEWEY
             There's nothing. I'm coming down.
   
   Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
   hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
   in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
   She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
   revealing
   
   
   THE GHOST
   
   Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
   the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out!
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
   knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
   just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
   of seats.
   
   
   UP ABOVE
   
   Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
   handicapped leg will allow.
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
   her.
   
   
   AT THE LECTURN
   
   Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Gale!
   
   He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
   it.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
   She tears it open, disappearing into...
   
   
   INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME
   
   Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
   in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
   Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
   
   Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
   Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
   as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
   heard, making their way towards her.
   
   Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
   
   
   GHOST FIGURE
   
   That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
   to secure it. There's no lock.
   
   
   AT THE MAIN DOOR
   
   Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
   immediately spots Gale.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Dewey moves to the window.
   
                       DEWEY
             Gale! Gale!
   
   She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
   sound proof barrier behind her.
   
   She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
   splattered against the glass.
   
   
   IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
   
   Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
   
   
   IN THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
   
   Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
   reveal it.
   
   Gale BEATS against the glass window.
   
                       GALE
                   (through tears)
             NOOOOOOO!
   
   Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
   She races to the door, throws the things away.
   
   She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
   through. And she's off and running.
   
   Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
   long enough to lock it.
   
   BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
   it and out into...
   
   
   THE HALLWAY
   
   Gale shoots down it.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER
   
   Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
   onto...
   
   
   EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME
   
   The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
   Sid goes for it.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
   
   Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
   
   Sid runs to them.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, help me. We have to call
             the police.
   
   Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
   no comprehension skills at all.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Do you have keys? I need to get
             inside.
   
   Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
   locked too.
   
   Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
   a big tree with a...
   
   BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
   moves toward it.
   
   As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
   chained to the tree.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Mickey? Mickey?
   
   A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
   very much dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, no, Mickey...
   
   She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
   funk, his eyes wide.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
             been here all night.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Listen to me. We've got to get
             help. The Killer's here.
   
                       MICKEY
             What are you talking about?
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's after me.
   
   Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
   
                       MICKEY
             Shit! You've got to cut me down,
             Sid.
   
   Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll be right back.
   
                       MICKEY
             Where you going?
   
   Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
   settles on a shovel.
   
   Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Watch out.
   
   Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
   
                       MICKEY
             Do it again.
   
   CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
   peering into the night.
   
                       MICKEY (CONT'D)
             What was that?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't panic.
   
   Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
   it.
   
   Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out.
   
   Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
   
   Mickey looks up, just in time.
   
                       MICKEY
             SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
   
   Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
   
   Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
   
   The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hey.
   
   Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
   across the yard, running smack into...
   
   
   THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
   
   But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
   they counter, keeping her surrounded.
   
   Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
   They close in on her, ready to strike.
   
   She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
   
   Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
   
                       MICKEY
             Run, Sid...
   
   Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
   the front of the yard.
   
   Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
   
   Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
   just in time to see...
   
   Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
   knives strike at the same time. One through the
   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
   ground.
   
   Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
   running, along the side of the house, through a row of
   shrub that take her to...
   
   
   EXT. STREET - SAME
   
   Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
   middle of it.
   
   She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
   
   She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hallie?
   
   But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER
   
   Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
   emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
   goes for it.
   
   Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL
   button.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from phone)
             What is your emergency please?
   
                       GALE
             Someone's trying to kill me. I need
             the police.
   
                       VOICE
             Are you in danger now?
   
                       GALE
             Yes, goddammit!
   
                       VOICE
             Where is your attacker?
   
                       GALE
             I don't know.
   
                       VOICE
             Stay under the safety light. Help
             is on its way.
   
                       GALE
             The safety what? Fuck that!
   
   Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She
   looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side
   theatre door.
   
                       GALE
             SIDNEY!
   
   But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
   into the phone.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Fuckin' hurry.
   
   Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE SAME
   
   The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
   proscenium stage.
   
   Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
   The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
   the stage wings.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hallie?
   
   Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
   side of her.
   
   Complete darkness.
   
   DRIP! DRIP!
   
   Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
   wipes it from her face when...
   
   CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
   blinding.
   
   CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
   
   The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
   antique weapons and...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
   She breaks into tears. And then...
   
   Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
   trapping her. She looks in shock at...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
   set of DEATHTRAP.
   
   Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
   
   CLAPPING!
   
   A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
   
   Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
   find...
   
   
   COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
   
   Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
   arms and legs bound by electric tape.
   
   Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
   pleading eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Quick, untie me.
   
   Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
   down to untie him but stops.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from behind video
                   camera)
             You've seen this movie before,
             haven't you?
   
   Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to
   reveal...
   
   
   DEREK
   
   He smiles at her.
   
                       DEREK
             Smile for the camera.
   
   Sidney remains silent.
   
                       COTTON
             Sid, c'mon.
   
   Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
   one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
   
                       DEREK
             Go on, untie him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is a set up.
   
                       DEREK
             That's quick.
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
             us.
   
   Derek begins filming again.
   
                       DEREK
             You must be dealing with some
             serious trust issues right about
             now.
   
   Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
   where Hallie hangs.
   
                       DEREK (CONT'D)
             Sidney, you can't keep your back to
             the audience like that. Could you
             cheat a little forward for me?
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney.
   
                       DEREK
             You're really stumped, aren't you?
             You know there's two killers but
             you don't know who they are. I'm a
             given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
             But now you're torn. Everyone else
             appears to be dead. Except for
             Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
   
   Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
   out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
   Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
   alive.
   
                       HALLIE
             Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The
             story of your life, Sid.
   
   Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
   down from the wall with a big hunting knife.
   
                       DEREK
             Need some help, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got it..
   
   Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.
   
                       DEREK
             You should really see your face
             right now, Sid. It's doing some
             freaky shit.
   
   Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yeah, you look quizzical yet
             pensive.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, how can we help? Do you have
             any questions regarding the sequel
             of your life?
   
   Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why?
   
                       DEREK
             Good question. You took the bait.
   
                       HALLIE
             Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
             Well, Derek and I have this whole
             Mickey/Mallory-Woody
             Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing
             going on.
   
                       DEREK
             I really don't like that
             comparison, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
                   (to Sid)
             He hates Oliver Stone.
   
                       DEREK
             I find his work overwrought.
   
   Sid is waning.
   
                       HALLIE
             C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've
             been planning this baby for a year.
             Humor us.
   
   Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to
   untie him.
   
                       DEREK
             Nope. You had your chance.
   
   Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs
   off.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THEATRE SAME
   
   Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it.
   It's locked.
   
                       GALE
             Shit.
   
   She moves down along the theatre to another door.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER
   
   Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming
   her with the camera.
   
                       DEREK
             We met on the internet.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sent me the cutest e-mail.
   
                       DEREK
             I read her postings on the horror
             movie chat boards and fell
             hopelessly. Hook, line...
   
                       HALLIE
             We have our own website now. We
             dedicated a whole page to you.
   
                       DEREK
             You'd me amazed at how many of us
             there are out there. It's a whole
             world, Sid. You're really popular
             amongst the demented.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're the one who got away.
   
                       DEREK
             Until now.
   
                       COTTON
             You guys are fucked.
   
                       HALLIE
             Actually Cotton, and I think
             critics would agree, it's the other
             way around.
   
                       DEREK
             Poor Cotton, could life be a little
             more cruel?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not going to get away with
             this.
   
                       HALLIE
             Of course not. Who wants to? What's
             the point if we don't get caught?
             Where's the glamour in that?
   
                       DEREK
             The way I see it. We'll be
             arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
             the home footage. Secure a book
             deal. If all goes as planned, our
             trial should coincide with the
             release of STAB II.
   
                       HALLIE
             A verdict and premiere all on the
             same day. I love it.
   
                       DEREK
             We're hoping for the death penalty.
             I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING
             swan song exit planned.
   
                       HALLIE
             And now, drum roll please...
   
                       DEREK
             Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one
             last surprise for you.
   
   Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had
   loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
   them.
   
                       HALLIE
             A twist ending if you will.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we really had our work cut
             out for us. It really is the curse
             of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
             thing's been done.
   
                       HALLIE
             ... so we had to be different but
             yet the same because if you venture
             to far away from your orginal story
             you completely alienate the
             audience...
   
                       DEREK
             And we didn't want to do that, Sid.
             We wanted to give you your money's
             worth.
   
                       HALLIE
             So we found a compromise.
   
                       DEREK
             Or it found us.
   
                       HALLIE
             We have a surprise guest star
             waiting in the wings.
   
                       DEREK
             Just for you, Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
             flip.
   
   Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Oh yeah.
                   (to Sid)
             We figure the one of us that
             actually kills you will get a
             little more press. It's been an
             ongoing discussion.
                   (to Hallie)
             Heads or tails?
   
                       HALLIE
             Tails.
   
   He flips the coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Shit! You win.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She
   eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing
   over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either
   side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney!
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy
   to see her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gale!
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
   
   
   THE CURTAIN DROPS
   
   Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
   curtain separates them.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
   throat.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's about time she showed up.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
   
   
   INT. STAIR WELL SAME
   
   Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
   it and steps in coming face to face with a...
   
   
   A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
   
   Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             standing, lips pursed.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
             you.
   
   Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
   
   
   INT. STAGE SAME
   
   Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
   knees, next to Cotton.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
   
                       SIDNEY
             Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
             your methodical expertise but I
             have a question. What's going to
             happen after I die? I thought the
             heroine is supposed to live.
   
                       HALLIE
             Not this time.
   
   Hallie moves in on her.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we're trying to send a
             message to Hollywood. I'm really
             getting tired of all the happy
             endings. It's just not reality. In
             the real world the good guys die,
             the innocent are punished, and the
             murderers inherit the earth.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But nobody wants to see that. It'll
             never go. They'll rewrite you. You
             don't want that.
   
                       HALLIE
             Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
             I guess fearing death makes one
             anxious.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You fucking freaked out movie nut
             psychos...
   
                       VOICE
                   (off camera)
             Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
             don't create pyschos.
   
   Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
   very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
   turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
   hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
   doesn't want to miss a second.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Don't you know that by now? It's
             about family. It all starts at
             home. It starts with the father...
             and the mother.
   
   Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
   Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Mrs. Loomis?
   
   Gale stops cold.
   
                       GALE
             What?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God.
   
   Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
   
                       GALE
             Jesus. It can't be.
   
                       HALLIE
             Told you we had a guest star.
             Didn't see that coming, did you?
   
                       DEREK
             Everything's taken on a hyper-
             reality, hasn't it?
   
                       GALE
             You're Billy's mother?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I couldn't believe you didn't
             recognize me. You even interviewed
             me for your book.
   
                       GALE
             You're all in this together?
   
                       DEREK
             We had to have financing.
   
                       HALLIE
             Tuition's expensive.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why Mrs. Loomis?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where should we start? Your mother
             ruined my marriage by sleeping with
             my husband. You ruined my family by
             killing my son. Gale aired it to
             the world. Should I go on... isn't
             that enough?
   
                       GALE
             Jesus, you're just as whacked as
             your son.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where do you think he got it?
             Mental illness is heriditary. Who
             do you think incouraged him to kill
             your mother? He was a smart kid but
             children need parental guidance.
   
   Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
   total disbelief.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
             never would have been able to it
             without her.
   
   Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
   smiling.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And I couldn't have done it without
             you two. Now who won the coin toss?
   
   Hallie raises her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             I did.
   
   Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
   FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
   forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
   wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
   
   Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
   to Debbie.
   
                       DEREK
             What are you...
   
   Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
   the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
   knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
   This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
   Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
   ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
   wrists.
   
   
   SIDNEY AND GALE
   
   Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Nice kids but a little out there.
   
                       GALE
             What are you going to do?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Finish what my son started.
   
                       GALE
             But you'll never get away with it.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Enter Cotton Weary.
   
   Cotton looks up.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
             Think about it. An innocent man
             wrongly accused. Spends time in
             prison where he justs sits with his
             righteous anger, waiting, planning
             his revenge. His life so
             incomprehensively ruined he's
             forced to take revenge on the
             people responsible. It's perfect.
   
                       COTTON
             No... not again.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
             just meant to be a killer.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You'll never get away with this.
   
   Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Who would you like to shoot first,
             Cotton?
   
   Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
   With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
   strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
   Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
   goes down. Dead.
   
                       GALE
             Thank God.
   
   Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
   helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
   about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
   takes a deep breath. Relieved.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
             so sorry.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah...
   
   Gale gives him a hug.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
   
                       GALE
             Thank you.
   
   He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
   behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
   move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
   goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
   
   Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
   body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
   Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
   
                       SIDNEY
             NOOO!
   
   Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
   lay, he pulls the tape from it.
   
                       COTTON
             It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
             ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
             the victim.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, Cotton, don't do this.
   
   He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
   
                       COTTON
             I get my revenge and make some fast
             cash.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's over, Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Not until you're dead.
   
   Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
   the set door to...
   
   
   BACKSTAGE
   
   Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
   wail. She races down it.
   
   She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
   SCRIM!
   
   Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
   above.
   
   Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
   lightning speed.
   
   Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
   
   
   INT. CATWALK SAME
   
   The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
   
   Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
   ending.
   
   AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
   
   WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
   CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
   RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
   STABS COTTON.
   
   HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
   OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
   TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
   CLOSE.
   
   
   
   THE END (FOR NOW)
Scream 3 - early draft

EHREN KRUGER

2nd DRAFT - REVISED

MAY 2, 1999

FADE IN:

A big dramatic crescendo as we --

								OPEN ON:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL

Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to 
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly 
DISSOLVE INTO:

INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT

A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot 
teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in 
his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city 
of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated 
argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

				 BEN
				(into cell)
			God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
			I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
			Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
			a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
			I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
			in all your squandering the best you can do for me is
			A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
			It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
			offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
			worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
			you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should 
			fire you and go to ICM.

				CATHY(O.S.)
			   (off phone)
			Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad 
			mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
			famous as you are today. The least you can do is
			show me a little god damn respect.

				BEN
			   (into phone)
			You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
			FUCK YOU! You're fired.
			   (Ben hangs up)
			Unfucking believable.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares 
uncomfortably.

				BEN
			Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. 
			Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
			JASON DOES BROADWAY?

Ben's phone rings. He answers it.
	
				BEN
			   (into phone)
			What's up, B.D. with the B.D.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			   (off phone)
			Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.

				BEN
			Christine?

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
			Of course it's me, silly.
			And I feel like an ass standing
			in this theater lobby all by myself.
			Where are you babe, the movie starts
			in twenty minutes.

				BEN
			Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
			there was some big accident. It could be
			a little while so I don't want you to start
			freaking if I don't get there at exactly,
				(checks watch)
			Eight thirty.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
			p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

				BEN
			   (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
			Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
			I bet you did such a great job.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			I did. Hon, although I got a total of
			six minutes screen time, they're the
			best six minutes of the movie.

				 BEN
			Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
			Look, my battery's dying . . .
		
But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the 
conversation short.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			 Sure thing.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the 
windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going 
anywhere.

CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

CLOSE ON CARD -

A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to 
life in his hand.

				BEN
			  (startled)
			Jesus.
			  (answers call)
			Hello?
	
				VOICE
			Hello.

				BEN
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			Who is this?

	At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish 	
	deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two	
	films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.


				BEN
			Well what number are you trying to reach?

				 VOICE
			 I don't know.

				 BEN
			I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

				 VOICE
			Do I?

				 BEN
			  (peeved)
			Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
			Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

				VOICE
			Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

				BEN
			  (angrily)
			Asshole, Can't talk.

				VOICE
			But your voice sounds so familiar.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			Does it now?


				VOICE
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben 
Damon.

				 BEN
			   (smiling profusely)
			Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

				 VOICE
			Really? You're such a talented actor.

				BEN
			  (loves the praise)
			Thanks.

			 VOICE
			Now let's see you act your way out of this one.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if 
you will.

				 BEN
			What do you mean?

				 VOICE
			I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES 
			ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend 
			Christine is in there.  She's all alone. 
			Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film 
			to start.
			   (laughs coldly)
			I've got my knife.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the 
PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

				 BEN
			 (turning pale)
			Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

				 VOICE
			More of a game really. 

				 BEN
			What kind of a game?

				 VOICE
			You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
			Here's how we play. I ask you a question. 
			You get it right, your girlfriend lives. 
			You answer wrong, she dies.

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay a finger on her 
			I'll fucking kill you!

				 VOICE
			Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. 
			First question, Your girlfriend's counting on 
			you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have 
paid attention to Christine he might have known this.


				 VOICE
			Come on. Don't you know?
		

				 BEN
				  (hesitating)
			It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character 
			she plays in the movie!

				 VOICE
			Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. 

				BEN
			What?! But I did everything you said to do!

				VOICE
			That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're 
			taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me 
			beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. 
			I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

				BEN
			What?!

				VOICE
			Good bye Ben.
	
Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and 
then . . .

				RECORDED MESSAGE
			   (off phone)
			Due to the high volume of calls this evening,
			Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
			not a real emergency please call another dep-

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

				 VOICE
			You're not playing by the rules Ben.
			Don't you want her to live?

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

				 VOICE
			No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
			you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
			Do you understand? 

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV 
into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car 
screeches down the off ramp.

								 CUT TO:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. 
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the 
awaiting b.g.

								 CUT TO:


EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps 
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing 
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into 
his SUV, gets an idea.

THE BACK --

--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not 
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE 
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 

				BEN
			   (to himself)
			Thank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards 
the sign when suddenly --

HIS CELL RINGS.

Ben answers the call.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Yeah.

				VOICE
			Very good. You follow directions well.
			Now for the final part of the game.
			Put down the bat and approach the sign,
			slowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the 
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Where are you?

				VOICE
			Closer than you think.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
			from me?

				VOICE
			To see your reaction.

				BEN
			Reaction to what?

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a 
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs 
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.


				BEN
			OHMYGOD! NO!
			CHRISTINE --

Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in 
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the 
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, 
not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal 
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, 
face to face with his attacker.

				BEN
			  (screaming)
			BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
		
				THE GHOST
			You just lost the role Ben.
			Consider this your parting gift.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, 
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

	TITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"

									OPEN ON:

	EXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the 
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for 
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

				 GALE
			Good morning Hollywood. And today
			officially starts the Summer movie
			season. Opening the box office this
			week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
			in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy
			and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
			and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
			in STAB 2, based off my best selling
			book the WINDSOR MURDERS. 

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea 
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

				 GALE
			Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
			to the occasion. Today we have director of the
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
			Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
			welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
	
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, 
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy 
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee 
mug beside Gale's hand.

				ROMAN
			Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

				GALE
			It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

				ROMAN
			   (addressing audience)
			Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
			many fans of the genre. And I must say
			that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
			or Tori or David not returning to complete
			the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
			here. Aided with my excellent cast of
			newcomers I believe we're going to pull
			off one of the best Stabs yet.

				GALE
			Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
			seems that way.
				(a beat)
			Honestly though, 
				(smiles) 
			tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

				ROMAN
			  (a long pause)
			Honestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this 
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

				GALE
			Your life?

				ROMAN
			Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with 
			those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like 
			I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick 
			your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to 
			a Tobe Hooper flick.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into 
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second 
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of 
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her 
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as 
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign 
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing 
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to 
Roman.

				GALE
			Would you excuse me for a moment?

				ROMAN
			  (smiling)
			Sure.

Gale bolts for --

INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He 
grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

				GALE	
			Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
	
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to 
			introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
			  (flashes badge)
			Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, 
			or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

				GALE
			Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.
			He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the 
			second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part 
			in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Both of them were found brutally murdered this 
			morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy 
			reports having come back to me yet but the 
			bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.  

				GALE
			So is that why you're here? Is that why you're 
			holding me from my show, to tell me about some 
			brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but 
			there's more. The killer left a note.

				GALE
			A note?

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping 
in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND 
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother 
Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

				GALE(O.S.)
			That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
			There's more.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across 
the back "SIDNEY".

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
			but she's keeping herself very well hidden.
			You're my one and only hope in finding her.
			Her life may be in grave danger.

				GALE
			I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
			sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
			I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
			she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
			person that might know is, 
			  (gale hesitates), 
			not going to talk.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			And who would that be?

							CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY

A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY 
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 
. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.

All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey 
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

							CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY

A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane 
hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another 
corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In 
other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the 
Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy 
of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and 
they exchange greetings.

				TOM
			Hey Dew, did you hear?

				DEWEY
			No, what?

				TOM
			Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

				DEWEY
			That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
			making movies in the hills, the next day 
			you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a 
clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample 
cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 
playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark 
hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the 
production.

				 SARAH
			Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with
			these re-writes. It's like every five
			minutes there's a new script. God, and
			you just know this all because of STAB 2's
			script winding up on the internet two months
			after it wrapped shooting.

				TYSON
			And still the film is Number One at the box
			office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
			and Arlington Street.

				ANGELINA
			I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

				TYSON
			Nah I think it's doing so damn well because
			one of it's players got iced. I just hope
			none of us end up dead.

				ANGELINA
			Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.
			God Ben Damon was such a hottie.

				TYSON
				 (sighs)
			And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
			but I'm really concerned about my safety 
			now.

				SARAH
			What are you talking about?
			The murders were a completely isolated
			incident.

				TYSON
			(reading from script)
			SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
			"What are you talking about Ricky, the
			murders were a completely isolated incident".

				SARAH
			Would you give that script a rest?	
			It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

				TYSON
			I'm just saying, though. What if there's
			someone out there stalking actors? Huh?
			Then what?

				ANGELINA
			There's always someone out there stalking
			actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

				TYSON
			Melinda McGraw?

				ANGELINA
			No, the other one. The one who played his
			wife. 

				SARAH
			I know who you're talking about. Rebecca
			something.

				ANGELINA
			Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.
			Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
			too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
			Jody Foster, --

				TYSON
			Listen Miss ingénue, your cheering me up to much,
			Give it a break.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm 
around her. She shoves him away.

				TOM
			What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
			I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
			Jeez.
			   (lights up a smoke)
			So what are you doing tonight?

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

				TOM
			Talk about moody.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with 
bedroom eyes.

				TOM
			And how about you good looking?
			Got any plans for later?

				SARAH
			Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
			with that doesn't look like you.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at 
Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

				TYSON
			Oh no. I ain't into that shit.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

							  CUT TO:

DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.

They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

				 GALE
			Déjr vu-do.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher 
Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat 
on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY 
dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

				 VOICE(O.S.)
			Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
			comes running. What a shock.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.
			I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's
			Events?

				DEWEY
			Yeah. A real tragedy.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the 
two.

				GALE
			Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, 
			this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

				DEWEY
			What so you can just exploit her again with another
			book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

				GALE
			  (to Kincaid)
			Show him.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of 
			Ben and his girlfriend.

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly 
growing.

				DEWEY
			I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
			I promised her nobody would ever find her.
			If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
			approach her with this on my own and see
			what she'd like to do about it.

Kincaid nods.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else
			should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

				DEWEY
			Understood.
			  (a beat)
			If you'll excuse me Detective.
			  (coldly)
			Gale.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm going to have a little chat with the
			producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice 
O.S.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, 
rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon 
green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on 
her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't 
really want to be in her company very long.

				Gale
			Shit.

				Jennifer
			Listen, I know we've never met, and 
			I don't mind you never returning my calls, 
			but I have to tell you that after two films 
			I feel like I am in your mind.

				Gale
			Well, that would explain my constant headaches.  

				Jennifer
			  (defensively)
			You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' 
			that's a pretty good fall back.

				Gale
			Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty 
			good fall back.

				Jennifer
			Gives me more time for my work.  
			After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex 
			character.

				Gale
			And to be played by an actress with such 
			depth and range.  

Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.

				Dewey
			No answer at Sid's. Where'd 
			the Detective go?

	
				JENNIFER
			   (excitedly)
			DEWEY!
	
Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.

				Jennifer 
			  (fondles Dewey's butt)
			Gale, I think you'll really appreciate 
			my character work in this one, someone's 
			helped me understand the real you.

				Gale
			Someone?

				Jennifer
			The ruthless ambition, your private 
			self-loathing, and that lost and lonely 
			little girl inside.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Jennifer
			You heard me. 
			  (takes Dewey's cellular) 
			Thanks Dewey.  I'll return it.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Dewey
			Little girl inside.

				Gale
			I thought you were supposed to be in 
			Woodsboro!

				Dewey
			Well, I'm surprised you thought about me 
			at all.  Listen I gotta get back to 
			trying to get hold of Sid.
			Besides, she's more important than you ever were.

				Gale
			Wait! Dewey we can work on this together!
			As a team! Like in the past!

				Dewey
			No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this
			time I'd like to catch the killer before 
			the body count gets any higher.
			  (a beat)
			Toodles.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two 
producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man 
with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy 
fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, 
ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their 
conversation.

				MILTON
			I can assure you that security on the set
			will be at an all time high. Again, the
			deaths are sheer tragedy.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.
				(laughs)
			I myself am a big STAB fan.

				BUDDY
			Really?
				(smiles)
			Have you ever thought about acting?
			You've got just the right face.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I am kind of dedicated to my job.
			Although I do enjoy taking acting
 			classes on my weekends. I grew up
			around these studios anyway. I know
			my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter
			for PARAMOUNT.

				MILTON
			Really, what was his name?

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

				GALE
			Excuse me Detective, I think we have some
			business to attend to.

				MILTON
			   (flabbergasted)
			GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here?
			No press on the set!
			   (to security)
			No press, no press on set!
			Get that woman out of here.

				SECURITY GAURD
			  (approaching)
			Yes, Mr. Milton.
			
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.

Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.

				MILTON
			Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

				GALE
			Oh come on! Why the hostility?

				MILTON
			Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and 
			all but last month I happened to catch 
			your little segment on me and how my wife 
			left me because I'm a sex addict who 
			enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. 
			It was a real eye opener my lawyers are 
			still thinking about bringing to your 
			superior's attentions.

				GALE
			  (shit-eating smile on her face)
			They're the ones who approved it.

Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at 
Kincaid.

				GALE
			Alright Kincaid, no where to?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I go to the police station and do my job,
			and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

				GALE
			Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, 
			give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.

				GALE
			Shit. Can I even get a ride home?

	INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her 
black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal 
awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at --

THE BEDROOM WINDOW

SIDNEY --

--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into 
conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's 
wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips 
are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. 
She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --

MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the 
window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.

				SIDNEY
				(crying)
			   Mom!

Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The 
streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through 
the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --

THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. 
SIDNEY screams --

AWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE.

Her dog's barking wildly.

THE WINDOW is fine. 

SID crawls out of bed, disappearing out of the room.

								  CUT TO:


	INT. SID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sid's washing up at the sink. She wipes the tears from her eyes.She shuts off 
the running water, looks up into the mirror. Her demeanor definitely shows the 
ware and tear of all that's happened to her in her past. 

CLOSE on SIDNEY'S WRISTS.  Two ugly scars run up Sid's wrists.Battle Scars of 
a war waged between her own personal demons if you wish. Former Suicide 
Attempts former engraved on time.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid's house is deep within the Napa Valley. Secluded amongst verdant vineyards 
and orchards that are now covered by thedarkness of night. A full moon hangs 
ominously in the sky above.
A light burns from within the two story farmhouse. A phone dialing out rises 
in pre-lap as we --

  CUT TO:

INT.  SID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY 
(her play from SCREAM 2) and a poster proclaiming WOMEN'S RIGHTS with 
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS center written beneath that.

A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is 
thrown open.

THE PHONE--

SID PUTS ON A HEADSET, dials a number. RINGING.

				SIDNEY
			   (into headset)
			This is Laura in Monterey reporting
			in for work.

				OPERATOR(O.S.)
			Alright Laura I'll patch you right 
			in to a call.

				SIDNEY
			Thanks.

A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY
			Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor.
			How can I help you.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Laura I think I just killed somebody.

				SIDNEY
			Are you sure?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone!
			OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!

				SIDNEY
			Well then the people you need to call are the police.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			No I need to call you. Just you.

				SIDNEY
			I'm sorry, your voice.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?
			  (a beat, Sid goes blank)
			Are you listening to me, huh?

				SIDNEY
			Who the fuck is this?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			It's mother, Sidney, now be a good 
			girl and turn on the news. DO IT!

Sid reaches for the remote control, flips on a small TV lying across the 
office.

ON THE TV --

A REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g.

				REPORTER
			The mutilated bodies were discovered late 
			last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor 
			Ben Damon was slated for a role in the 
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO --

Sidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din:

				VOICE
			Do you think it's over Sidney?
			Do you?

				SIDNEY
			W-what do you want?

				VOICE
			I want to finish what I started.
			I want to finish the game.

				SIDNEY
			You sick fuck I'm tracing this call
			as we speak! The police are gonna nail
			your ass!

				VOICE
			   (laughs coldly)
			Let them try. You'll never find me.
			I've already gotten away with murder before.
			For instance, Maureen Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			  (tears welling)
			No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis
			and Stu Macher did.

				VOICE
			Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think.
			It's all been building up to this Sid.
			Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of
			blood that's been spilled has all been
			leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.

				SIDNEY
			The final act? Well let's play asshole!

				VOICE
			No. We play in my court this time.
			Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting 
			corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set 
			on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.

The killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

				VOICE
			Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you
			real soon Sidney. Real soon.

Click. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of 
the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and 
peers out her office window.

SIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT.

									 CUT TO:
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT

Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner.

EXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car.

KILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit 
offices.

									 CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are 
promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a 
big cardboard GHOST.

				SARAH
			STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself 
			a better agent.

Sarah walks down a hallway.

				SARAH
			  (calling out)
			Anybody home?

Sarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open.

				SARAH
			Doubt that.
			  (door slams shut O.S.)
			Anyone here?


Sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly --

TYSON comes reeling out of a doorway, a huge knife jutting out his back, blood 
trickling down his mouth. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson 
breaks into hysterics.

				TYSON
			Stan! My man does great work.

Stan, a bearded, middle aged make-up effects guy steps out behind Tyson, slaps 
him a high-five.

				STAN
			Thank you. Thank you very much.

				SARAH
			Fuck you very much!
			Tyson go to hell!
			What the hell are you doing here?
			Where's Roman?

				TYSON
			Roman and everybody else went home for 
			the night. I'm here for a make-up test.

				SARAH
			Make-up. You need it.
			  (a beat)
			Hey, Roman isn't here?

				TYSON
			No.

				SARAH
			Damn. He called my roommate and told her 
			he had some important things he wanted to 
			go over with me in his office tonight.

				STAN
			  (jokingly)
			Yeah I bet.

Stan pantomimes the "blow job" gesture. Tyson laughs, slaps him another high-
five. Sarah makes a disgusted face as the two men leave the offices. Sarah 
sighs, ducks into Roman's office.

INT.  ROMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Roman's office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia. Sarah plops down behind 
Roman's desk, admires his old TRANSFORMER toys and two brass MUSIC VIDEO 
AWARDS. Sarah examines the award.

				SARAH
			   (reading inscription)
			For the honorary field of directing and 
			cinematography in music videos.
			How to the point. 

The phone rings scaring the shit out of Sarah. She drops the award, causing it 
to smash against the edge of the desk, snapping the head clean off. Sarah 
hesitates, answers the call, putting it on speaker phone.

				SARAH
			Oh shit.
			  (into phone)
			Hello? Director's office.

				ROMAN
			Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running 
			late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 
			minutes away.  

				SARAH
			Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at 
			your   music video awards.  

Sarah tries fixing the award with some scotch tape.


				ROMAN
			All right, since I got you on the phone, 
			let's talk about your character.

				SARAH
			What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who 
			gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes! 

				ROMAN
			You're not happy with your part.

				SARAH
			I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. 
			I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm 
			not happy that my character is too stupid not to 
			have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been 
			cut into McNuggets.

				ROMAN
			Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the 
			lines.

				SARAH
			Huh, fine.

				ROMAN
			Page 22, Candy's big moment.

				SARAH
			Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?

				ROMAN
			Hello.

				SARAH
			Who's this?

				ROMAN
			Who's this?

				SARAH
			This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some 
			clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have 
			to start the scene in the shower!  The whole 
			shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I 
			mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?

				ROMAN
			Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is 
			that like candy cane or candy apple?

				SARAH
			Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have 
			the wrong number.

				ROMAN
			But you know my favorite name? 

				SARAH
			I'm hanging up right now.

				ROMAN
			It's Sarah.

				SARAH
			Roman that's not the line.

				ROMAN
			It is in my script. 

				SARAH
			Has there been another goddamn rewrite?   
			How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our 
			lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? 

				ROMAN
			It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

				SARAH
			What?  What movie?

				ROMAN
			My movie.

A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's 
sinister voice.


				VOICE
			It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a 
			fucking pig.
			Still in character, Sarah?

Sarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees 
a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room. 

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah locks the door, backs up right into --

AN ARMY OF GHOSTS!

AT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah 
catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone, 
starts to dial.

INT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices.

				SECURITY GUARD
			Mr. Bridger?

No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH 
and the killer inside!

  CUT TO:

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for 
Sunrise Studios drags out.

				SARAH
			Shit.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work 
boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the 
ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the 
next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop 
weapons.

THE GHOST --

Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to 
chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto 
the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

				SARAH
			  (screaming)
			No! No! Noooo!

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a 
final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs 
her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out 
her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm 
resonates in the b.g. The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen.

A NICE PSYCHO-ESQUE close up of the dead Sarah's eye as Blood swirls into the 
pupil.

   SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT.  HIGHWAY 39 -  N. CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

The highway is desolate. It's late. Sidney speeds into frame in her HONDA 
CIVIC.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HONDA CIVIC - NIGHT

Sidney's tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie 
song filters off the radio. The only light comes from the unsettling neon 
green digital clock/radio read-out. Sidney increases speed.

INT.   STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Kincaid and Gale stare at Sarah Darling's corpse as it's zippered up into a 
black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers.
			It looks like we're going to
			be getting a warrant to speak
			with Miss Prescott anyway.

				GALE
			Shit. Sarah Darling.
			   (a beat)
			I interviewed her too.
			God, it's happening again isn't it
			Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yes well we have a suspect, so don't
			get that worried.

Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.

				GALE
			Who?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm not at liberty to tell you that
			Miss Weathers. You're no longer working
			with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why
			you're standing in here right now. By
			all means I should have you thrown out.

				GALE
			But you won't. You're a good man detective.
			We think alike. I know you need my help.
			And I know you know I need your help.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			In my fifteen years as a homicide detective
			I've never met a single soul as pushy and
			brazen as you are Miss Weathers.

				GALE
			Please, call me Gale.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his 
late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his
			phone records. He's the last person to
			speak to Sarah Darling before she died.
			Or at least call her home.

				GALE
			Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified 
			information. Why don't you go investigate 
			the bad meat at the A.P.
			This is police work, not Pulitzer material.

				GALE
			Hey, fuck off.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (cocky)
				Well then. Looks like I'll go dust for
				finger prints with Barbara Walters.

Wallace arrogantly walks off camera. Gale looks at Kincaid.

				GALE
			So, what now?

CUT TO:

INT.  INTEROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and 
Kincaid grill him with questions.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke
			with Sarah Darling before she died.

				ROMAN
			That's because I didn't.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.

				ROMAN
			What meeting?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah
			and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate 
			answered the phone, says it was you.

				ROMAN
			Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told 
			her to go   anywhere!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.  

				ROMAN
			Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did 
			not call   Sarah Darling!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Sarah Darling said you did.

				ROMAN
			Someone is trying to ruin my movie.  
			Someone wants to kill   my movie!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll 
			be something interesting to put on the 
			director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.

				ROMAN
			  (dry laugh)
			 Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.
			 Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?
			 They're actually shelving my film because there's 
			been one ensie little murder. God, three people died 
			during the filming of The Exorcist.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I 
			strongly doubt the killer of them left messages 
			on the scene for the police to find.

Camera pans through a two-way mirror into . . .

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

GALE AND DEWEY stand, gazing through the two-way mirror. Roman can't see them. 
They watch nervously.

				DEWEY
			They found another note?

				GALE
			Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one  
			about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or 
			not it looks like we're going to have to  go 
			back into our past.

				DEWEY
			You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid.
			This has nothing to do with you Gale.

				GALE
			This has everything to do with me Dewey.
			I was the one who brought the nation's  
			attention to this shit anyway. I'll be  
			damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass  
			on the buck again.

				DEWEY
			Do you really mean it this time Gale?

				GALE
			Yes. Look, let's get something straight  
			Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police  
			came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to  
			make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

				DEWEY
			Why would the police come to you?

				GALE
			Again, I am the author of the definitive book on 
			the Woodsboro murders.!
			  (a beat)
			What about you?

				DEWEY
			What about me?

				GALE
			You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only 
			place that's real!'  But now you're here.  
			Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited 
			until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, 
			it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is 
			like seven everywhere else.

				DEWEY
			So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a 
			month? L.A Forever?

				GALE
			It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I
			could've been the next Diane Sawyer!

				DEWEY
			What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?  
			I liked her! 

				GALE
			It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.

				DEWEY
			You used to say that was our strength.

				GALE
			Dewey, you're not just here because of  
			that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video 
			version of me, are you? 

				DEWEY
			Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not 
			About you.

				GALE
			All of what Dewey?  You do know something, 
			don't you?

				DEWEY
			Off the record.

				GALE
			Always.

				DEWEY
			Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a
			woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to 
			see the file on Sid, for research.

				GALE
			And?

				DEWEY
			The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.  
			A month later, the station gets broken into, 
			the file room ransacked.

				GALE
			Someone stole Sid's file?

				DEWEY
			I already removed it.  I think someone on the 
			film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only 
			reason I came here. To make do a little 
			private investigating of my own and make sure no 
			one here was planning anything.

				GALE
			  (whips out cellular)
			I'm sorry, this is too good!

				DEWEY
			What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?

				GALE
			Right. Sorry.
			  (a beat)
			Do you think he did it?
			  (RE: ROMAN)

				DEWEY
			  (his beeper goes off)
			I've got my suspicions but still, 
			nothing  you say can ever make me take 
			my eyes off one person.

				GALE
			And who is that?

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and 
years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

				DEWEY
			Jennifer needs me.

				GALE
			Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

				DEWEY
			I'm on duty.

Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace 
has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

The wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON 
hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance.

CUT TO:


EXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway 
in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.

				DEWEY
			  (noticing Gale)
			Stop following me.

				GALE
			I happen to work for the police god dammit!

				DEWEY
			You're not a detective.

				GALE
			Neither are you, Magnum P.I.

				DEWEY
			Gale, your engine's still running.

				GALE
			Fuck!

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to 
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY 
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

				TOM
			Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

				GALE
			Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
			That's a shocker.

				TOM
			Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
			last month. The one where you said my car
			accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
			and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
			insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

				GALE
			Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
			Stage the news to boost ratings.

				TOM
			Really, cause that stunt lost me the
			lead role in Roman Polanski's latest
			picture. Huh, what a coincide I was
			picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,
			not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get
			my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,
			because of your big mouth I'm here,
			drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second
			rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
			Jollie and yourself!
			  (a beat, subtle)
			Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should
			Have a look at your break line. That your
			car over there?

Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.

				GALE
			I think we should go inside. I have to have
			a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.

				TOM
			  (laughs)
			You mean what's left of us.
			  (tosses empty bottle aside)
			Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
			Gotta refuel.

Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.

 CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER JOLLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees 
Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her 
make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

				JENNIFER
			You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

				GALE
			Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? 
			What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those 
			USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly 
			you suck at acting?

				JENNIFER
			God damn you Gale Weathers! 
			Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his 
			victims as they die in the script!
			Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
			So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so 
			his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's 
			Candy, and now me!

				GALE
			Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!
			Number one there were five different 
			versions of the script given out.
			Ben Damon was given a fake script because 
			he was only being offered the role.
			It only had fragments of real scenes from the 
			actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's 
hands.

				GALE
			  (reading script)
			AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!
			This is complete bullshit.
			Who wrote this piece of crap?

				JENNIFER
			I know right. It was kinda weak.
			That's cause Will Kennison only wrote 
			a rough treatment of it.
			The script was written by some new guy. 
			He wrote Arlington Street.

				GALE
			Still that was a much better movie,
			I saw it at the premiere last week.
			God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked 
			with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

				ANGELINA
			  (crying)
			What are you talking about?
			Because of this shit I'll probably never 
			act in a Hollywood film again.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

				TOM
			Hey good looking, if you play your cards right, 
			I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch 
			and try you out for a few films my  production 
			company is working on.
			  (a beat)
			How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans, 
follows after her.

				TOM
			I'll be right back.

CUT TO:




EXT.   JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around. Angelina's nowherein sight.

			Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you?
			I was only playing! Hey look, I can really
			get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?
			  (pauses)
			Damn it. There goes my chances of getting
			some head from her.

 Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the 
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

				TOM
			Aaaangelina?

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom 
smirks, steps inside.

   CUT TO:

 INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

 The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS 
BLACKENED BY THE NIGHT. Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the 
black shadows peeling off the wall.

IT'S THE GHOST!

				TOM
			Angelina?

 Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet 
is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

  THE GHOST --

				TOM
			You fucker!

 The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The 
ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to 
lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom 
gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  
trickle of blood down his lips.

				TOM
			  (gagging)
			Fucker!

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the 
closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST 
steps back, admiring his work.

  CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously.

				JENNIFER
			Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?

				GALE
			 I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important 
			is that we stick together.
			 No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

				DEWEY
			What about Sidney?

				JENNIFER
			What about her?

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the 
front door.

				DEWEY
			Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
			I'll get it.

				JENNIFER
			What if it's the killer?

				GALE
			Oh use your brain drama queen!
			Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? 
			Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in 
			some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or 
			Chucky? Huh?

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked 
away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

				DEWEY
			Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

				GALE
			Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer 
huddle together, follow close behind.

				JENNIFER
			Do you smell something?

				DEWEY
			  (smirking)
			It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. 
Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, 
turns it when suddenly --

THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!

EVERYONE SCREAMS!

				DEWEY
			Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.

Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A 
SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.

				DEWEY
			Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading 
outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

				GALE
			Who's phone?

				JENNIFER
			Oh shit it's my cell!

				DEWEY
			Answer it!

Jennifer answers her cellular.

				JENNIFER
			  (into phone)
			Hello?

				VOICE
			Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?

				JENNIFER
			It's him! It's the killer!

 Gale rips the phone out of Jennifer's hands.

				GALE
			  (into phone)
			Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck
			do you want?

				JENNIFER
			What's your favorite scary movie Gale?

				GALE
			I dunno but I can tell you that your's
			will be the home video footage of me
			sticking my foot up your ass! Now come
			out and fight like a real man you pussy!

				GHOST(O.S.)
			I just might!

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer 
screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up 
his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey 
backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

				JENNIFER
			God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!
			He's dead!

				GALE
			No! He's not dead! He's still breathing!
			Look!

				DEWEY
			Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out
			of here.

Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door. A noise O.S. Dewey pauses, turns 
around --

THE GHOST IS GONE.

Dewey looks to the patio door.

SO IS JENNIFER.

				DEWEY
			OH. OH GOD. GALE --

				GALE
			What?

				DEWEY
			  (screaming)
			GALE BEHIND YOU!

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back, 
kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through 
the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the 
hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

				JENNIFER
			(screaming)
			DIE MOTHER FUCKER!
			DIE! DIE! DIE!

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her. 
Helps her up.

				GALE
			Come on!

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a 
trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell 
Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame 
trail lunges towards the two women. They scream.

				DEWEY
			OH SHIT! RUN!

CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! 
THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.

A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains 
down onto the Earth.

THE GHOST --

WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK.

SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE.

AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON

 WE ARE:

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale 
sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously 
been drenched).

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Whoever it is, now is taking credit 
			for Maureen Prescott's murder. 

				GALE
			But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, 
			Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they 
			even told Sidney how they did it!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in 
			your book that Sidney got it wrong before.  
			She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, 
			and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a 
			third killer.  Sidney Might know something 

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

				DEWEY
			I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  
			And even if there was a third killer, 
			Sidney doesn't know about it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,
			she is a key element in this case.  I have a press 
conference 
			in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead 
			celebrities.

				GALE
			Four? There are five.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.
			Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned 
			how to count.

				DEWEY
			What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Police are still searching through the debris.
			Could be days before we find her . . . that is,
			if she's even there.

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever 
so nefariously at Dewey.

				GALE
			OK, look.  We all know that this has something to 
			do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the 
			killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Actually, there was more this time.
			This time, we found a picture too.

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (together)
			What?

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it 
over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Before you jump to conclusions, the man in 
			the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country 
			on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's
			got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's
			supposedly the biggest thing down under since
			Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

				DEWEY
			What does this have to do with Sid?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her
			own daughter?

				DEWEY
			Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he 
			was married to Maureen.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			   (chiming in)
			What's your problem?  Last night you were almost 
			charcoal.  You gonna help us or what?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?

				DEWEY
			Is that a threat, Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			When it's a threat, you'll know it.

				DEWEY
			  (a beat)
			Is that a threat?

				GALE
			Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers 
			later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either 
			Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going 
			to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly.

				DEWEY
			What are you doing here? I told you to

				SIDNEY
			Well it's not safe for me up there either.
			The killer found me Dewey. He called me

				DEWEY
			What?

				SIDNEY
			I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up

				DEWEY
			There's someone here who wants to help.

				GALE
			Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.

				SIDNEY 
			Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.

For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.

				GALE
			Thank you.

				DEWEY
			Sid, this is detective Kincaid.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. 

				DEWEY
			The killer called her.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What?  When?

				GALE
			What'd he say?

				SIDNEY
			Oh, you know, the usual small talk, 
			"What's new, how ya been, how do you want 
			to die?"  

				DEWEY
			Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've 
			gotten your number?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.  
			Did you call her from the set?  

				DEWEY
			No.

				GALE
			Do you have her number stored in your memory?
			  (Dewey thinks)
			Phone memory!

				DEWEY
			Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

				GALE
			Has anyone else every used your phone?

				DEWEY
			Just Jennifer.  
			   (To Kincaid_) 
			And you.  


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.

Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each
			murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo
			of your mother. 

				SIDNEY
			Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.  
			Why didn't you say something?

				DEWEY
			I was afraid they were bait, something to, 
			ya know,  trick you out of hiding.

			Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Are you sure?

				SIDNEY
			Absolutely.

A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, 
scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up.

This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape 
marked SCARY MOVIES 101.

				SIDNEY
			Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!
			What are you doing here?

				RANDY
			Told you I'd make a movie someday, huh?

 WE ARE:

INT. TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, 
cramped trailer watching the tape. 

				SIDNEY
			 Oh MY god.

				RANDY
			Well, if you're watching this tape, it means 
			as I feared, I did not survive these killings 
			here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason 
			I am here is to help you, so that my death 
			will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will 
			help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  
			If this killer does come back, and he's for real, 
			there are a few things that you gotta remember.  
			Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same 
			rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you 
			find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, 
			and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel 
			rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing 
			with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding 
			chapter of a trilogy.

				DEWEY
			A trilogy?


				RANDY
			That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, 
			but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned 
			with, because true trilogies are all about going back 
			to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't 
			true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed 
			something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So 
			if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some 
			super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be 
			super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him 
			won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta 
			cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him 
			up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can 
			die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final 
			chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the 
			time this thing is through.  Number three; the past 
			will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you 
			think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO BACK LOT - DAY

Sidney and Karen are hugging.

				SIDNEY
			Thanks Karen. You be careful.

				KAREN
			Don't worry Sid. I got tickets to see
			Family Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior
			motive for driving all the way down here.

Karen smiles. She hugs Sidney one more time, scampers away. 

				GALE
			I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys 
			later.  

				DEWEY
			Do you want us to come with you?

				GALE
			I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping

Gale runs off.

				SIDNEY
			I can see nothing's changed.  

				DEWEY
			No.

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices 
the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles. 
Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book, 
pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them 
in the lock. NOTHING.

A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling 
scream. It's only JENNIFER.

				JENNIFER
			Geez.

				GALE
			What the hell are you doing?

				JENNIFER
			Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?

				GALE
			I am Gale Weathers!

				JENNIFER
			Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, 
			no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants 
			to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you.  
			So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, 
			if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and 
			since they really want to kill you, they won't 
			kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense? 

				GALE
			None.

				JENNIFER
			You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.

				GALE
			And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.

				JENNIFER
			That's funny.


				GALE
			Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.

				JENNIFER
			Need to get in that building?

				GALE
			  (sarcastically)
			No really?

				JENNIFER
			There a story in that building?

				GALE
			Possibly.

				JENNIFER
			  (flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card)
			Gale Weathers would find a way. 
			  (she swipes and opens the door)

Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously 
behind them with a loud CLACK.

INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale leads the way down the dark hall.

				JENNIFER
			Basements creep me out.

				GALE
			Really, you know you'd make a fascinating

				JENNIFER
			Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more

				GALE
			  (smiling)
			Oh I wish I got that one on tape.
			It'd put a smile on my face everytime

			Bitch.

The two turn the corner, stepping into -

INT.  CLERICAL AREA - ARCHIVES - DAY

BIANCA BERNADETTE, an aging, former actress in her late forties, early 
fifties, sits behind a desk doing paperwork.

Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at 
Gale and Jennifer.

				BIANCA
			Can I help you?

				GALE
			I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro 
			and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman 
			for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

Bianca shakes her head "no".

				BIANCA
			I don't watch TV and I hate books.
			Whatta you need?

				GALE
			Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

				BIANCA
			Nope.

				GALE
			  (groans)
			Well can you tell me if the woman in this 
			picture looks familiar to you.

Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's 
desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused.

				BIANCA
			Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those 
			files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

				GALE
			Well if you won't work for me, will you work 
			for the president?

Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, 
slides the money back.

				BIANCA
			The president . . . of the studio.

				JENNIFER
			Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?

Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the 
desk. It's absolutely stunning.

				JENNIFER
			Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy.
			  (to Gale)
			My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story.

How can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger.

				BIANCA
			Follow me.

Gale reaches for her Twenty. Bianca slaps her hand, takes it, folding it up, 
sliding it between her cleavage.

				GALE
			  (interrupting)
			 It may be Maureen Reynolds --

				BIANCA
			Well you'll find neither.
			Rina Reynolds, however,
			You will.

				JENNIFER
			  (smiling)
			Rina Reynolds. What a stage name.

				BIANCA
			You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.

Gale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up. Inside are 8x10 headshots of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT when she was younger. Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed 
listing of the films she's starred in.

				 GALE
			What are these movies? 'Amazombies',
			'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?

				BIANCA
			Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

				GALE/JENNIFER
			  (together)
			What?

				BIANCA
			You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer?
			Those were some of his early flicks.

Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace.

				SIDNEY
			Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.

				DEWEY
			Do you want me to come with you Sid?
			I mean, remember what Randy said?

				SIDNEY
			No I'll be ok. I've got my mace.
			My knife.
			  (smiles, raises up her fists)
			These two lethal weapons.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Sure you don't need a police escort?
			That's what we're here for.

				SIDNEY
			No really, I'll be fine.

Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage.

				SIDNEY
			I'll be right back.

 CUT TO:

INT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY

Sidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches 
for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a 
man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty 
bathroom.

				SIDNEY
			H-hello? Anyone there?

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She 
flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls 
for feet.
What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard 
when she sees --

THE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly --

				MAN(O.S.)
			  (whisper)
			Sidney.

This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to 
make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly --

WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits 
the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the 
killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on 
her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging 
out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in 
her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney 
slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the 
first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, 
burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a 
tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, 
she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair 
of attackers come back for more.

CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks 
up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Shit.

BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams, 
runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other 
side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off 
running for WALLACE and DEWEY.

WALLACE AND DEWEY,

HEARING THE SCREAMS, spin around, drawing out their guns.  Wallace looks at 
Dewey.

				DEWEY
			  (re:gun)
			Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.

				SIDNEY
			  (hysterical)
			Jesus Christ Dewey help me!
			They tried to kill me in the bathroom!
			The killers!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Wait a second? Killers? There's two
			of them now? Aw shit!

Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. Sidney falls into Dewey's 
arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (into phone)
			Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem   down 
			here on the Sunrise Studios lot.
			No not another one. At least not yet.
			Yeah we've had an attack.
			  (to Sid)
			Do you need medical assistance?
			  (Sid nods her head 'no')
			No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.

 Wallace closes up his phone.

				DEWEY
			What?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Well I got some good news in a way.
			Roman Bridger didn't make those calls
			To Sarah Darling. Police let him go.
			Here's the bad news: The cellular was
			cloned, it's untraceable. We now have
			no suspects.

				GALE(O.S.)
			Dew!

Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer   and Gale race into 
frame.

				GALE
			Sidney, what happened?

				DEWEY
			Nevermind, what'd you two find?


				GALE
			We did some researching in the archives.
			Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the
			book on your mother's murder. For two years
			of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically
			disappeared off the face of the Earth.

				SIDNEY
			What are you talking about?

				JENNIFER
			We've found out where she went.


				GALE
			She was an actress Sidney. Minor
			B-Movies. But now we have a new
			suspect in this twisted fucking
			web . . . John Milton.


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The head of the studio?


				GALE
			It makes sense doesn't it? It's his
			big grandiose swan song from the genre.
			What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?


				JENNIFER
			Sidney, what happened?


				SIDNEY
			I was attacked in the bathroom.


				DEWEY
			Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating
			the bathroom?


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (looks at building)
			I'm waiting for back-up.
			I don't carry bullets in my
			gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.

 Dewey nods suspiciously.  Kincaid comes rushing into  frame.


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?
			I got a call on my cell from home.
			They told me that someone was attacked.

				DEWEY
			And what made you think it was Sidney?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (glaring)
			Sid, get in my car. You're coming   
			back to the station with me where it's   
			safe.

				GALE
			Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay     
			John Milton a little visit.

				DEWEY/JENNIFER

			Agreed.

Milton's on the phone with Roman.

			Roman I know you're upset. But there will

			you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great
			script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC
			 MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by
			John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director.
			What?
			  (knock at the door)
			Come in.
			  (into phone) 
			No, not to you Roman.
			Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office.

				DEWEY
			So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.

			MILTON
			Just what the hell do you people think
			you're doing, barging in here like this?
			I've got important calls to make. I run
			this studio.

				GALE
			Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?

				MILTON
			Who?

				JENNIFER
			Rina Reynolds.

				MILTON
			Do you know how many actors have worked
			for me? Hundreds, thousands. 

				GALE
			Nobody said she was an actor.

				JENNIFER
			Good twist.
 
				MILTON 
			What's your point?

				DEWEY
			No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

				MILTON
			I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple 
			of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?

				JENNIFER
			Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story 
			of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and 
			you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!  

				GALE
			Settle down Beavis.
			  (to Milton)
			Why don't you tell us the truth?


				MILTON
			What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror 
			films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me 
			with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.  

				DEWEY
			But you know who she was.

				MILTON
			When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd 
			known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.  
			I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?  

				GALE
			And now? I mean, murders on your set and 
			still you say nothing?

				MILTON
			Get real, that would make me a suspect!

				GALE
			Just because you knew her?

				MILTON
			Yeah.

				GALE
			I don't think so!  Just what happened to 
			Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

				MILTON
			Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.  
			It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller 
			out behind the barn and shot him in the head a 
			long time ago.

				GALE
			Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug
			up and drug all over National TV? Why don't
			you start talking.

				MILTON
			It was in the 70's, everything was different.  
			I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.  
			It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get 
			them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing 
			happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or 
			another, no matter what she said afterwards.

				GALE
			Are you saying she was-

				MILTON
			I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they 
			did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth 
			is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges 
			were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds 
			wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in 
			Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.

INT.   DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. 
Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'SCRIPT WRITING and 
SELLING YOUR WORK IN HOLLYWOOD'.

				SIDNEY
			What do you know about trilogies?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			You mean like, movie trilogies?

				SIDNEY
			You seem to like movies, Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep 
			calling you Sidney.

				SIDNEY
			I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, 
			Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, 
			all bets are off.

				SIDNEY
			  (noticing a huge file on her)
			Did you request this case?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal 
			with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my 
			way around the studios.  

				SIDNEY
			Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			To me Hollywood is about death.

				SIDNEY
			Excuse me?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you   
			see what I see day in and day out, the violence that 
			people do to each other, you get haunted.  
			I think you know about that.  

				SIDNEY
			What do you mean?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't  
			Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head,  
			whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. 

				SIDNEY
			Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop 
			being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, 
			you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, 
			Miss Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			Hmm.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What did you know about your mother?

				SIDNEY
			I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect 
			family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a 
			secret life, and I tried to understand that, and 
			soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' 
			know who my mom was.
			  (a beat)
				Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my 
			mother for the first time. You know, with TV and 
			those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel 
			like I'm just learning about myself for the first 
			time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (a long beat)
			Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. 
			That's good news.

				SIDNEY
			How is that good news?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, 
			flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle 
			guys like that.

				SIDNEY
			Oh yeah, how?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Catch him, or kill him. 

Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, 
jacket, etc.

				SIDNEY
			Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?


Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes 
glaring right into hers.

Jennifer is gagging.

			Oh God Gale, Dewey was right.
			Stop getting so nervous and you

Jennifer's quiet.

			I think Milton's the killer.
			I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

				 GALE
			Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.
			 He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack

			 I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and

			by John Sayles.

Milton's going rapid fire.

				VOICE
			Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. 
			Well, at least not for you.


THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, 
John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. 
A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.

			Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

				GALE
			Oh Dewey I'm sorry.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up, 
rubs his head.

				GALE
			Here. Let me --

JENNIFER, chimes in. Clearly annoyed.

				JENNIFER
			Excuse me Gale! What the hell

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it 
almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.

				DEWEY
			  (shaking it off)
			Let's get this drawer open.
			If it's locked, there must be something  
			inside he's trying to hide.

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked 
drawer. The lock's smashed off.

				GALE
			Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey 
shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

				JENNIFER
			What? What'd you find?

Gale's eyes widen.

				GALE
			Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never

			Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!

				DEWEY
			Huh?

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST 
jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops 
to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer 
wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Gale run!

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of 
the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Dewey!

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale 
screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer 
sending him flying onto his back.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of 
them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens 
with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

MILTON --

--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to 
gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. 

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, 
giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale 
races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked 
"stairs". She bolts through the door.

				GALE
			  (frantic)
			He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!

			Alright, calm down. I'm going

				VOICE(O.S.)
			Not so fast. We're not finished.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, 
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the 
hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife 
menacingly.

				VOICE
			I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
			It's only gonna end up with you getting

The phone rings. Sid answers it.  

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY'S VOICE(O.S.)
			  (off phone)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY
			Who is this?

				PHONE SIDNEY(O.S.)
			Who is this?

				SIDNEY
			Um wh-who's calling?

				PHONE SIDNEY(O.S.)
			Um wh-who's calling?

				SIDNEY
			Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, 
			I can only hear myself.

				VOICE
			  { a click }  
			I only her you too, Sidney. 

				SIDNEY
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			The question isn't who I am.  The question is, 
			who's with me. 

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Sidney, stay away!

Sid's face floods with fear. She rushes towards the office door when suddenly, 
the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.

				VOICE
			Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract 
			attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.   
			Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

				SIDNEY
			Yes.

				VOICE
			Go there.

Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's.

				VOICE
			Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.  
			When you're friends with Sidney, you die!  
			Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.  
			It's up to you.  

				SIDNEY
			How do I know their voices are --

				VOICE
			Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?  
			How do you know I'm not someone in your head?  
			Somewhere, you know.  

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Don't come here Sidney!  

We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard.

				GALE
			Dewey! No!

				VOICE
			Or do you?  

				SIDNEY
			You're dead!

				VOICE
			I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. 
			You show yourself, they survive, you run, 
			they die! 

				GALE
			Oh God!  Oh God!

				VOICE
			Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to 
			know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who 
			killed your mother? 

				COP(O.S.)
			Have you seen Kincaid?

				 COP 2(O.S.)
			NO.  But Wallace is around.

				SIDNEY
			Where?

				VOICE
			She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

				SIDNEY
			WHERE?

				VOICE
			I'll call you, when you're on your way.  

Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying.

				SIDNEY
			Fuck!

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when 
something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls 
up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

  CUT TO:

INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Yeah?

				VOICE
			You follow directions good.
			Now let's wrap this production.
			Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot.
			I'll call you when you get there.

Click. The killer hangs up.

   CUT TO:


EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT

Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on 
the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.

     CUT TO:

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. 
Again, she answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright, I'm here. Now what?

				VOICE
			You're doing real good. Can't
			you figure it out? I wanna finish
			this where it all began. Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			I thought you wanted me here?

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is 
startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production 
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's 
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the 
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

  CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT

Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her 
this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. 
Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can 
			finish this.

				VOICE
			It's good to see you again Sidney.
			I was growing real impatient.
			Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE 
set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S 
CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house 
perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is 
there. Sid's phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			Yeah?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (off phone)
			Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

				 SIDNEY
			Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Sid I can see you!

				SIDNEY
			Where are you Dewey?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid!
			The killer's looking for you!
			Quick untie me!

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated 
before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is 
DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN 
ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at 
the phone.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Good work Sid. 

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to 
face with --

THE GHOST 

HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box 
in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.

				GHOST
			  (Sid's voice)
			You play a good game Sidney.
			Now it's time to get down to business.

				SIDNEY
			Who are you?

				GHOST
			  (click-now he's Maureen's voice)
			Your other half.

 The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the 
darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own 
childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed. 

INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer 
begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something 
upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.

CUT TO:

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT

Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from 
Kincaid's office.

LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --

GALE WEATHERS

				SIDNEY
			GALE!

Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth.

				GALE
			Christ Sidney hurry up!
			That fucking lunatic is coming!

Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up.

				SIDNEY
			Gale he's got Dewey!

				GALE
			I know! He killed Kincaid!

				SIDNEY
			I know!

				GALE
			Let's get out of here!

				SIDNEY
			   (screaming)
			GALE WATCHOUT!

KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and 
Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails.

 CUT TO:

DEWEY --

Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally 
beginning to pull and tug on his bindings.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape.

 CUT TO:

INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and 
locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos 
outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the 
furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a 
black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the 
killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

				GALE
			Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here!
			He can't get us both!

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

				GALE
			RUNNN!

Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls 
utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

BAM!

The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by 
her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in 
her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS.

Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf 
grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering 
open, blurrily staring up at --

THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.

SID stands up, takes off running towards --

THE MACHER HOUSE SET.

   CUT TO:

INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and 
bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in 
Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and 
evil wasfought. It's déjr vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (weakly)
			Sidney?

Sidney turns around --

DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand.

				SIDNEY
			  (eyes lighting up)
			Dewey!

Sidney embraces Dewey.

				DEWEY
			Where's Gale?

				SIDNEY
			They've got her!

				DEWEY
			Sid I want you to stay here!
			I'll be right back!
			I'm not gonna let them get Gale!

Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open.

STANDING across the set is THE GHOST, knife raised.

				DEWEY
			  (tightening grip on gun)
			 Hold it right there you fucker!

Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.

				DEWEY
			  (nervously)
			OH shit!

THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before 
embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney 
screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid 
screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns 
around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at 
Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.

She's been brutally stabbed.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Oh God.

BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls 
out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.

				ANGELINA
			Time to sort things out.
			Whatta you say?

CUT TO:

INT.  MACHER LIVING ROOM - SET - NIGHT

Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint. Gale's been handcuffed 
and tossed onto the couch.

ON THE TV --

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of MAUREEN PRESCOTT plays.

				SIDNEY
			It's you?! All of this is because of you?

				ANGELINA
			No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really  
			wants to meet you.  

Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her. Causing her to stop in her 
tracks.

				ANGELINA
			Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off.
			Not now.

				VOICE(O.S.)
			You're not going anywhere Sidney.
			It's time you came to terms with me, and with  
			mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.
			Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.

The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet 
proof vest.

				SIDNEY
			Who the hell are you?

				THE GHOST
			The other half of you! I searched for a mother too, 
			an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her 
			my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked 
			her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome 
			me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a 
			new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only 
			child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold 
			forever, her own son!

THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.

				ROMAN 
			 Roman Bridger, director. And brother.
			  (a beat)
			She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was 
			Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, 
			what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little 
			home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, 
			mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one 
			thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, 
			that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing 
			his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And 
			once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was 
			a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case 
			you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like 
			her was making a movie.

				SIDNEY
			All the nightmares. All the hell I went through 
			was because of you, you spineless bastard!

				ROMAN
			I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, 
			Angelina over there,
			  (Angelina smiles)
			She's my partner. I can convince her to do 
			anything.  We've been dating since I met her in 
			Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			  (dryly)
			Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

				ANGELINA
			That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You
			were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. 
			I wanted to make you proud.

				ROMAN
			And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of
			a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every
			time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.

				SIDNEY
			   (repulsed)
			Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit 
			before! So lets get on with it!

				ROMAN
			Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.
			You haven't seen the best part.
			  (pulls out tape recorder)
			With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've 
			been able to steal your voice.
			  (presses play)
			Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna 
			find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

				SIDNEY
			   (off tape recorder)
			I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation
			of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to 
			make you all repent for your sins, and now
			I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.

Sid squirms.

				ROMAN
			   (clicking off tape recorder)
			Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that 
			John Milton, was my daddy?
			Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.
			 His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!
			That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.
			Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone
			in this world. What a good reason to --
			STAB MYSELF!

Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's 
arms.

				ROMAN
			See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,
			they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,
			they also set the stage for you! Introducing
			to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
			survivor! Sidney the star!

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. 
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

				ROMAN
			See Sid, now comes the part where we get away
			with it! The part where we win! Cause face it
			Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

				SIDNEY
			Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you
			kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and
			not because of any other fucking reason!

				ANGELINA
			  (screaming)
			Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's
			freaking me out!

				ROMAN
			   (screaming)
			God damn it Sidney!

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls 
herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 

				GALE
			  (coughing)
			Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain 
			Gale Weathers.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

				GALE
			  (leaping up)
			I know all the tricks!

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has 
a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

MEANWHILE --

ROMAN,

--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. 
He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE 
continues.

GALE AND ANGELINA,

Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood 
floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, 
begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the 
knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

SIDNEY--

Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

SUDDENLY,

WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. 
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. 
Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his 
wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

				SIDNEY
			Dewey my God I thought you were dead.

				DEWEY
			 Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

SCREAMING O.S.  

				SIDNEY
			DEWEY! IT'S GALE!

Sidney and Dewey race into --

LIVING ROOM --

Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

				 GALE
			  (screaming)
			THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!
			BITCH!

Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. 
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high 
voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and 
Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

--FOYER --

THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

					DEWEY
			Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always 
			superhuman.

				SIDNEY
			He wasn't superhuman Dewey.
			He wasn't superhuman at all.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried 
mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, 
hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and 
brain matter onto the wall behind her.

				GALE
			WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!

Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --

				SIDNEY
			  (pissed)
			This shit is really getting repetitive,
			you know?

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT 
SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.

Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

   CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING

The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE 

Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

				DEWEY
			Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what 
			if we try it out again.
			The whole relationship thing.

				GALE
			  (smiles)
			Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

 CUT TO:

WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Jesus Christ what happened?
			I leave for two seconds to take my
			kid to the doctor, I come back and it's
			the fucking WILD BUNCH.

				SIDNEY
			It was just something that's been itching 
			to be completed for the past four years.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			I guess so.

				SIDNEY
			Take care Detective. Give my regards
			to the wife and kids.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun 
rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we 
crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING. 
AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.

CUT TO BLACK

3.     Interior cheery, bright SUTPHIN kitchen.  CREDITS
       BEGIN.

       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

                            MOM
                  Who wants fruit salad?

                            MISTY
                  I do, please.

                            MOM
                       (Hesitating)
                  That's not gum in your mouth,
                  is it?

                            MISTY
                       (Removing it)
                  It's sugarless.

                            MOM
                       (Gently)
                  You know how I hate gum,
                  Misty.  All that chomping
                  and cheesing...
                       (Begins serving her)

                            MISTY
                  Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.
                   (To her brother, as she
                    prices a record album)
                  Hey, Chip, think I could get
                  50c for Vanilla Ice.

                            CHIP
                  I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

                            MISTY
                          (Dreamily)
                  Carl can't believe how much I
                  make at swap meets.

                            MOM
                  (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)
                  And who may I ask is Carl?

                            MISTY
                  Just a boy.  He's picking me up
                  this morning.

                            CHIP
                  Here we go again.

                            MISTY
                  He's really cute!

                  Cute is not enough, Misty.
                  You know that.

                            CHIP
                  She sure can pick 'em!

                       (Exasperated)
                  He goes to college with me!

                            DAD
                  Leave her alone, Chip.
                       (To MOM)
                  I think it's great she has a
                  new beau, Beverly.

       MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each
       hand and turns to the family.

                            MOM
                  Cereal anybody?

       Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen.

                            DAD
                  Just a little, please.  Bad
                  for the teeth.

                            CHIP
                  Always the dentist.

                            MOM
                  Chip, honey?

                            CHIP
                  Thanks, Mom.

       As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it
       lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her
       family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking
       the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing
       enough to make MOM's head explode.

                            DAD
                       (Reading paper)
                  Look at this!

                  "Hillside Strangler gets his
                  college degree in prison!"

                  (Preoccupied, stalking fly)
                  That's nice.

                            DAD
                  Nice?!  He should have been
                  executed!

                            MISTY
                  He killed people, Mom.

                            MOM
                       (To herself)
                  We all have bad nights.
                  (Gets ready to swat, but fly
                   buzzes off)

                       (To MISTY)
                  You'd probably date him!
                       (Mimicking her)
                  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did
                  you ever see "Henry, Portrait of
                  a Serial Killer?"

                            DAD
                  I certainly did not.

                            MISTY
                  You've been working in that
                  video shop too long.

                            DAD
                  And all that gore better hadn't be
                  interfering with your schoolwork.

       MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the
       rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's
       building anger.

                            CHIP
                  I do great in school, Dad.
                  (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

       A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to
       DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the
       rim in closeup.

                            DAD
                  Well, your mother's going to PTA
                  today.  We'll see what your
                  teacher has to say.
                  (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)

                            CHIP
                  (Giving a pleading look to MOM as
                   the buzzing of the fly builds in
                   intensity on the soundtrack)
                  Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!

                            MOM
                  (Moving in for the kill, hissing
                   the words in a rage)
                  Don't say the word "hate", honey.
                  "Hate" is a very serious word!

       MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody
       closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears).

       Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up
       in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack.

       MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at
       her family.

                            MOM
                  There.  All better.
                       (Suddenly all innocence)
                  Anybody for scrambled eggs?

       END OF CREDITS.

       A loud banging is heard on the back door.  MOM jumps up
       guiltily.

                  (Getting up from table)
                  Who on earth...?

       MOM opens door to two police detectives in plain
       clothes.  DETECTIVE MOORE is younger and more rugged
       than the older more world-weary DETECTIVE BRADFORD.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Nervously)
                  Yes?

                       (Shows badge)
                  I'm Detective Moore and this
                  is Detective Bradford.

                  I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's
                  the trouble, officer?

                            CHIP
                       (Excitedly)
                  Is there a killer loose?

                            DET. MOORE
                  No son, nothing that exciting.

                            MOM
                  This is my son, Chip...and my
                  daughter, Misty.

                  we don't allow gum chewing
                  in this house.

                  She lives right down the street.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Could you take a look at this...

                            DET. MOORE
                  ...And tell us of anybody who
                  might be responsible?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  (As he hands note to MOM and DAD)
                  I should warn you...this note
                  contains LANGUAGE.

       MOM and DAD open note.  In cut-out letters from a
       magazine it reads:  "I'LL GET YOU PUSSY FACE!"

                            MOM
                       (Recoiling)
                  Oh God, really!
                   (Hands it back to cop)

                       (In disgust)
                  This is a matter for adults.

                            MOM
                  Officers, I've never said the
                  P-word out loud, much less
                  written it down!

                            DAD
                  No woman would!

                       (In baby-talk)
                  See the little birdie?  Listen
                  to his call.
                    (Imitating bird call)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       CHIP and MISTY roll their eyes in embarrassment as
       bird calls back to MOM.

                            BIRD
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       DAD smiles proudly as detectives look at MOM in
       amazement.

4.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       A convertible pulls into driveway driven by CHIP's
       best friend, SCOTTY BARNHILL, a handsome but sullen
       red-necky teen.  Next to him is CHIP's girlfriend,
       BIRDIE STUART, a sexy tom-boy with lots of savvy.

                    (To cops, getting into his car)
                  That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut
                  just like my son.

                            MOM
                        (Fondly)
                  Good morning, Birdie.  This is
                  Detectives Moore and Bradford.

                   (Overdramatic, feigning horror)
                  I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't
                  lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!

                    SCOTTY in car)
                  Good morning Scotty!

       SCOTTY guiltily looks up from vintage Betty Page
       pin-up mag he's reading and toots horn defiantly in
       response as MOM grits her teeth.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hey Misty, look what I got!
                   (Pulling it out of bag)
                  A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you
                  sell it for me at the flea market?

                       (Impressed)
                  Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can!
                   (Looks up and sees a Trans Am
                    speeding towards the house)
                  Oh God, here comes Carl!

       DAD pulls off in his car and almost collides with
       CARL as he aggressively manoeuvres his car up the
       driveway.

       CARL PADGETT, a handsome jock climbs out of his car.

                            CARL
                         (To MOM)
                  You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
                  I'm Carl Padgett.

                            MOM
                  Misty's date...

                            CARL
                  More of a friend really...

       MISTY looks hurt.

                            MISTY
                         (To CARL)
                  See what Birdie gave me to
                  sell at the flea market?

                            CARL
                       (Sneering at Pee-Wee)
                  That guy's a weirdo.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face as CHIP and BIRDIE
       hop in SCOTTY's convertible.

                            MOM
                   (Pointing to SCOTTY and
                    calling out to COPS as they
                    get into their car)
                  Now there's something you should
                  be interested in, detectives.  A
                  grown boy who doesn't wear his
                  seat belts!

       SCOTTY gives MOM a hateful look and peels out.

       MOM is sitting on bed, dialing phone with a
       determined expression on her face.

       In split screen, DOTTIE HINKLE, the harrassed middle
       aged neighbor, looks at her ringing phone in her
       living room with suspicion and finally answers.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait
                         every time)
                  Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!

                            MOM
                  Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

                            DOTTIE
                           (Furious)
                  You bitch!

                            MOM
                  Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

                            DOTTIE
                  The police are tracing your call
                  right this minute.

                            MOM
                  Well, Dottie, how come they're
                  not here then, Fuck-Face?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Red with rage)
                  FUCK YOU!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MOM giggles to herself like a little kid and
       immediately redials the phone.

9.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.  BACK DOOR.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, MOM's frumpy, brittle, busy-body
       next door neighbor, is knocking on door, carrying a
       sewing basket.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                         (Calling out)
                  Beverly?  Beverly darling?
                  You home?
                    (She lets herself in)
                  I know you are...

10.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is laughing to herself listening to ringing
       phone while MRS. HINKLE, on split-screen, tries not
       to answer.  Finally she lunges for it.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Answering)
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!

                            MOM
                    (Disguising her voice
                       in prim manner)
                  I beg your pardon?

                            DOTTIE
                    (Horrified but suspicious)
                  Who is this?

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Wilson from the telephone
                  company.  I understand you're
                  having problems with obscene calls.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Mortified)
                  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson..
                  It's driving me crazy...I've
                  changed my number twice already...
                  Please help me!

11.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN walks through kitchen, wipes a
       finger on window ledge to check for dust and calls
       out Beverly's name.

12.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM doesn't hear MRS. ACKERMAN as she continues her
       phone conversation with MRS. HINKLE.

                            MOM
                   (Still the fake telephone
                    company representative)
                  What exactly does this sick
                  individual say to you?

                            DOTTIE
                  I can't say it out loud.
                  don't use bad language.

13.    INTERIOR MOM'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks up at huge oil portrait of MOM
       in ornate frame hanging over couch and calls out
       Beverly's name.  Hearing muffled voices behind MOM'S
       closed bedroom door at the top of the steps, MRS.
       ACKERMAN begins to creep up the steps.

14.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       Split screen with MOM and DOTTIE HINKLE.

                            MOM
                     (Still impersonating)
                  I know it's hard but we need
                  the exact words.

                            DOTTIE
                  Alright, I'll try...
                         (Primly)
                  "Cocksucker".  That's what
                  she calls me.

                            MOM
                   (Laughs hideously, begins
                    speaking in her scary voice)
                  Listen to your dirty mouth, you
                  fucking whore!

                            DOTTIE
                         (Ballistic)
                  GODDAMN YOU!

15.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN hears muffled shouts and reaches for
       door handle.

16.    INTERIOR BEDROOM.  SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN MOM AND
       DOTTIE.

                            DOTTIE
                  MOTHERFUCKER!!

                            MOM
                  COCKSUCKER!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MRS. ACKERMAN barges right in bedroom, almost
       catching MOM who expertly snaps back to normal
       without missing a beat.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly, are you alright?

                            MOM
                  Rosemary, honey.  Good morning.
                  I'm fine.
                     (Taking the sewing basket)
                  Thanks for remembering.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's the least I could do.
                       (Suspicious)
                  I heard shouting.

       MOM opens sewing box to reveal a pair of gleaming
       sewing scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Slamming it shut)
                  Just the damn cable TV company.
                  You know how they are.
                  Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, I did.  It's terrifying!
                  The police were at my house this
                  morning.

                            MOM
                  Who on earth would want to
                  harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?

17.    EXTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE.

       DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing
       to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out
       front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on
       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then
       fades out.

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.
         
       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
         
       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

18.    EXTERIOR TOWSON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

       Parking lot is filled and the few last parents are
       entering the building for PTA meeting.  MOM speeds
       into lot and gets out of car.  Subtitle appears:
       "3:O6pm" and fades out.

19.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

       MR. STUBBINS, Chip's teacher, is winding down a
       one-on-one meeting with another mother, who is in
       tears.

                            MRS. TAPLOTTER
                  But, Mr. Stubbins, my son
                  studies every night!  He's
                  trying as hard as he can...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Some teenagers just aren't college
                  material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's
                  nothing to cry over.  Now, there
                  are other parents waiting.
                       (Smugly)
                  ...thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

20.    INTERIOR SCHOOL HALLWAY.  OUTSIDE MR. STUBBINS'
       CLASSROOM.

       Parents are seated in folding chairs waiting to be
       called in to conference.  MOM comes rushing down
       corridor and other parents greet her.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Hi, Beverly.

                            MOM
                  Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your
                  outfit.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Thanks.
                          (Snobbily)
                  It's a Liz Claiborne.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Mrs. Sutphin, where's that
                  husband of yours?
                   (Making a bad dental joke
                    and pointing to his teeth)
                  Feeling "down in the mouth"?!
                  Hohohohohoho!

                            MOM
                    (Smiling through her teeth)
                  You're soooo funny, Ralph...

       MR. STUBBINS leans his head out of classroom and
       looks at roll book as MRS. TAPLOTTER leaves, dabbing
       her tears with a handkerchief.

                            MR. STUEBINS
                  Mrs...Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Excited)
                  Right here!

       MOM goes in classroom with him.

21.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins,
                  Chip's math teacher.

                            MOM
                       (Shaking hands)
                  Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.
                       (Handing him a tin)
                  A little something I baked.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Peeking inside)
                  Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank
                  you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.

                            MOM
                  Bon Appetit!

       They sit on opposite sides of his desk.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Chip is off to a fine start
                  this year.
                       (Checking his roll book)
                  Focused...conscientious...
                  participates actively in
                  classroom discussion.

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  He's a good boy.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Suddenly serious)
                  There is one big problem though.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face ever so subtly

                            MOM
                  What is it, Mr. Stubbins?

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Spitting out the words)
                  His unhealthy obsession with
                  sick horror films.

                            MOM
                       (Relieved)
                  He is assistant manager of a
                  video shop...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Cutting her off)
                  That's no excuse for a morbid
                  imagination.  I caught him
                  drawing this in class last week.
                   (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman
                    getting her tongue pulled out
                    with the title, "Blood Feast")
                  Is there a problem at home?

                            MOM
                       (Shocked)
                  Certainly not!

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?
                       (Knowingly)
                  Tell me, did Chip torture animals
                  when he was young?

                            MOM
                       (Furious)
                  No, he did not! We are a loving
                  supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Well, you're doing something
                  wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd
                  recommend therapy for your son.
                       (Rising from his chair)
                  Thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

       through bloodied water.

       Suddenly MR. STUBBINS grabs on to side-view mirror
       and attempts to grab MOM through side window.

       LU-ANN watches in horrified amazement and throws
       down joint like it's a hot coal.

       MOM starts swerving car but MR. STUBBINS holds on
       for dear life, grabbing at MOM, pulling her hair.

       MOM struggles and bites his hand like a snapping
       turtle.

       wad of gum flies out of MR. STUBBINS' mouth.

       MOM smiles to herself.

       LU-ANN, the only eye-witness, runs away in fear.

       MOM peels out and once in main parking lot resumes
       waving innocently to other parents as she flees.

       MOM swerves car into car wash.

23.    INTERIOR CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       On CHIP's large video screen plays the ridiculously
       dated but still appalling scene from "BLOOD FEAST"
       where the madman with the corny, madeup eyebrows
       rips a girl's tongue out of her mouth in hokey
       special effects.

       Subtitle reads "4:22pm" and fades out.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are hooting and hollering and eating
       popcorn as SCOTTY looks up from his vintage
       nudist-camp magazine to watch in real horror and
       nausea.

                            BIRDIE
                  It's a sheep's tongue!

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.

                            CHIP
                  Rewind it!  Let's see it again!

                            SCOTTY
                  No!  That shit is sickening!
                  Put on pussy!

                       (Gore scene replays)
                  SLOW-MOTION!

       SCOTTY starts to gag and tries to hide it,

                            BIRDIE
                       (Looking at screen)
                  BLOOD FEAST!

                  The "Citizen Kane" of gore
                  movies.

       SCOTTY looks at gore on video, jumps up to run to
       bathroom, yanks open bedroom door and screams when
       he sees MOM standing there with a plate of chocolate
       chip cookies.

                            MOM
                  I don't know what it is about
                  today, but I FEEL GREAT!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Gagging)
                  Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

       He runs past her to the bathroom.

                            CHIP
                  Hi, Mom.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

       MOM looks at TV monitor and sees madman taking out
       heart of girl.  MOM smiles inappropriately.

                            MOM
                       (Giggles)
                  You kids.  Now Birdie, I want
                  you to have a cookie and then
                  run along home.

                            CHIP
                  But Mom, the video's not over.

                            MOM
                  No "but mom" for you, young man.
                  Mr. Stubbins seems to think these
                  silly movies are interfering with
                  your studies.
                   (Turns off video with remote)

                  Oh, boy!
                       (Getting ready to leave)

                            CHIP
                  Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!

       SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better.

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, that one made me puke!

                            MOM
                   (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist
                    camp magazine and handing it
                    back to him like it's poison)
                  You forgot something...

                            SCOTTY
                       (Looking around confused)
                  Are we leaving?

                            MOM
                  Yes you are.

       SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags
       him out.

                            BIRDIE
                  Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.

                            MOM
                  Bye, Birdie.
                   (Sitting down next to CHIP
                       on his bed)
                  Chip, honey...I know it's hard
                  being a teenager but I understand..
                  I'm your mother and I love you.

                  Oh Mom...

                       (Suddenly his buddy)
                  Can we watch that scene again?
                  You know, where he rips out
                  her heart?
                       (Giggling scarily)
                  PLEEEASE?

       CHIP looks back at his MOM in sudden confusion.

24.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       SPIN-WIPE to tomato sauce topped meatloaf being
       taken out of the oven by MOM.  Subtitle appears

25.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP sit around dining room table.
       MOM enters with the meatloaf and a smile.

                            MOM
                       (Jokingly)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, the
                  perfect meatloaf!

                            DAD
                  Nothing like a home cooked
                  meal, honey.

                            MOM
                  Misty, I made your favorite
                  sesame broccoli...

                  ten pounds, he'll take me to
                  the University of Maryland
                  Fall Mixer.

                  Misty, if you want to lose
                  weight go ahead, but do it for
                  yourself, not for some boy you
                  barely know.

                  Doesn't threaten me, honey.
                  I'm happy.

                            MOM
                  I'm happy too and we want you
                  to be happy.

                  CHIP!  You know how much I
                  hate the brown word!

       Suddenly a scream from outside is heard.

26.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, the busy-body next door neighbor
       is running across lawn from her house to the
       Sutphins.

                  That's Rosemary.  Something's
                  wrong!

       CHIP and MISTY look at one another and stick fingers
       down their throats at mention of MRS. ACKERMAN'S
       name.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN runs in from kitchen in hysterics.

                  Mr. Paul Stubbins was

       caresses a picture of Manson and closes the book and

                  It's fine with me, Beverly.
                   (Kisses her again more
                    passionately)
                  You want to, honey?  You
                  think the kids are asleep?

                            MOM
                  We can be real quiet...

                            DAD
                       (Getting on top of her)
                  I love that you're my wife.

                            MOM
                       (Getting turned on)
                  You're not bad yourself,
                  coo-coo bird...

                            DAD
                   (Gently making love to her)
                  You bring me such peace...

                            MOM
                  Oohhhh, Eugene!

                            DAD
                  Shhhh..

                            MOM
                       (Getting louder)
                  Oooohhhh.

                            DAD
                  Don't wake the kids...

                            MOM
                       (Even louder)
                  Ooohhhh!

30.    MISTY'S BEDROOM.

       We see MISTY, hair in curlers, pricing junk for flea
       market, stop and listen to sounds coming from
       parents' bedroom.

31.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM and DAD are having romantic monogomous sex.

                            MOM
                  Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

                            DAD
                       (Really turned on)
                  You're hot tonight, honey...
                  but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!

32.    CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       CHIP looks up from reading "Fangoria Magazine" and
       listens in horror to his mother's distant moaning.

33.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM is panting wildly, a suburban sex machine.  DAD
       is amazed but hardly complaining.

                            MOM
                  Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!

                            DAD
                  Ooh, honey, I'm ready!
                  Now!  Now!

                            MOM
                   (In orgasm, wildly thrashing)
                  Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

34.    HALLWAY BETWEEN CHIP AND MISTY'S BEDROOMS.

       CHIP and MISTY open bedroom doors simultaneously,
       hear their parents climaxing and look at one another
       in complete horror.

       Fade to black.

35.    Slow fade in to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       Birds are heard greeting the sunrise with their
       happy chirping.  Subtitle appears "Saturday,
       September l9th, 5:3Oam" and fade out.

36.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM, dressed for bird-watching day-trip, watches the
       cute little chickadees nibbling seed out of her
       birdfeeder on lawn through binoculars from bedroom
       window.  DAD, half-awake, stirs in his bed.

                            MOM
                   (Tracking a particularly
                    cute bird)
                  There's Dede! He's my favorite
                  chickadee!  He's here every
                  morning for breakfast.

                            DAD
                       (Groggy)
                  Well, honey, chickadees breed
                  in Alaska, you know.  No wonder
                  Dede's hungry.  It's a long
                  trip all the way to Baltimore.

       MOM continues tracking the bird in her binoculars
       until she freezes in horror at the sight of MRS.
       ACKERMAN running her mouth next door to DETECTIVES
       MOORE and BRADFORD and pointing to MOM's car.

       Suddenly the phone rings with jangling intensity.
       MOM jumps.

                            DAD
                  Hello...

       On split screen is obnoxious man from PTA, MR.
       STERNER, holding his jaw in pain.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner.
                  Got a dental emergency here!
                       (Moans in pain)
                  I mean this goddamn tooth is
                  killing me!

                            DAD
                  Well, Mr. Sterner, if you
                  call my office, I'm sure we
                  can see you Monday.

       MOM starts shaking her head "No" to DAD just in
       case.

                            MR. STERNER
                  MONDAY?

       MRS. STERNER, his wife, grabs the phone.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Eugene, this is Betty Sterner,
                  He'll die by Monday!  The
                  roots are infected!  He might
                  have a heart attack!

                            DAD
                       (Wearily)
                  All right, Mrs. Sterner...
                  Nine o'clock.

       MOM's face changes to purple rage as she turns to
       hide her anger from DAD.

                            DAD
                       (Hangs up)
                  I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds
                  will still be there next week.

                            MOM
                   (Turning to face DAD,
                    suddenly stoic)
                  It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand..
                  I'll go fix breakfast.
                       (Exits calmly)

37.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM's calm turns to immediate rage as she closes
       bedroom door and storms her way downstairs as "Mom's
       Psycho Theme" blares on soundtrack.

38.    CHIP'S BEDROOM

       CHIP is sound asleep.  MOM enters in a fury.

                            MOM
                    (In his ear, loudly)
                  CHIP!!

                            CHIP
                      (Jumping up in fear
                       from sleep)
                  God, Mom!
                   (Looking at her scary face)
                  What's the matter?

                            MOM
                      (Back to normal,
                          sweetly)
                  Time to get up, that's all.
                  You'll be late for work.

                            CHIP
                  You scared me.

39.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY is sobbing in fury as she sits forlornly with
       boxed up flea-market junk.  MOM enters and is
       startled to see her.

                            MOM
                   Honey, what's the matter?

       MOM looks out back window in alarm to see DET. MOORE
       snooping through her box of recycled newspapers as
       DET. BRADFORD noses around her station wagon.

                            MISTY
                  I'm stoodup!  I'll kill
                  that bastard!

                            MOM
                  Don't say words unless you
                  mean them, Misty.
                   (Starts fixing breakfast)

       COPS bang loudly on door.  MOM jumps.

                            MISTY
                  It's him!

                            MOM
                  No, honey, it's the police.
                   (Opens back door)
                  Hello, officers.

       Subtitle appears "7:10am" and then fades out.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MISTY
                   (Subtly unbuttoning her
                    blouse one button)
                  Hi, Detective Moore.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Embarrassed)
                  Morning, Misty.
                       (All business)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard
                  of the death of Mr. Stubbins.

                            MOM
                  A fine man.  A good teacher...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Reading from notes)
                  Contrusions...fractures...
                  rupture of numerous vital
                  organs...

                            MOM
                       (In sympathy)
                  What a mess.

       MOM sees SCOTTY pull up in driveway with BIRDIE in
       his convertible.

                            MOM
                    (Seeing MISTY's eyes light
                     up at hearing a car)
                  No, honey, it's just Scotty.
                       (To COPS)
                  Scotty, who doesn't wear his
                  seatbelts!

        DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY
        barge in back door.

                            DAD
                  Good morning, Detectives.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Dramatically)
                  Nightmare on Calverton Court!

                            SCOTTY
                  The Maryland Teacher Massacre!

                            DET. MOORE
                  That's not funny, son.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Did you drive your car to the
                  PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs.
                  Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Buttering toast)
                  Yes, I did.

                            DAD
                       (To cops, getting angry)
                  Detectives, what is this about?

                            DET. MOORE
                  I know this sounds weird,
                  Mr. Sutphin, but the Department
                  of Motor Vehicle's computer shows
                  only one blue station wagon
                  registered to a parent of any
                  of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

                            DAD
                  Surely you don't think Beverly
                  was involved!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Hamming it up,
                        pointing to MOM)
                  SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right
                  at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him
                  down!

                            MOM
                       (Quickly staring daggers at
                        SCOTTY before patiently
                        addressing COPS)
                  From what I understand, the
                  eye-witness is a drug user.

                            MISTY
                  I got somebody you could
                  run over, Mother!

                            DAD
                  Misty, that's a terrible
                  thing to say!
                    (Putting his arm
                     protectively around MOM)
                  Detectives, it's time for you
                  to leave.  My wife knows
                  nothing about this terrible
                  ...accident.

                            MOM
                       (Correcting him)
                  Murder, honey.

                            SCOTTY
                   (Picking up a "People"
                    magazine with Ivana Trump
                    on the cover)
                  Now, here's a babe!

       COPS see magazine cover with the "P" in "People" cut
       out as in threatening note sent to Mrs. Ackerman.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Suspiciously)
                  Let's see that, young man.

                            MISTY
                    (Whispering to BIRDIE as
                     she ogles him from behind)
                  Nice buns!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  "P" as in...

                           MOM
                      (Glaring at SCOTTY)
                  ...People who don't mind their
                  own business.

       DAD looks at MOM suddenly, for the first time
       showing slight suspicion.

                            MOM
                       (To DAD)
                  It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine,
                  honey.
                       (To COPS)
                  Look at the subscription label
                  if you don't believe me.
                       (Proudly)
                  I recycle my magazines.

40.    Wipe to EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is dumping all her bottles and
       newspapers into the rest of her garbage without the
       slightest thought of recycling.  Subtitle appears
       "10:06am" and fades out.

       Cut to GUS and SLOPPY, two Baltimore County
       sanitation workers as they pick up bags of
       neighbors' recycled trash and scowl in hatred at the
       environmentally incorrect MRS. ACKERMAN.

41.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MOM, now alone, is happily separating her cans and
       plastic trash into proper recycle bins as she rocks
       out singing along with the Barry Manilow record
       "Daybreak" that spins on her high-fi set.

                            MOM
                      (Singing and dancing
                       in place as soulfully
                       as possible for her)
                  "It's Daybreak"
                  If you want to believe
                  It can be Daybreak!..."

       MOM looks out through her kitchen window and sees
       MRS. ACKERMAN dumping styrofoam packing chips in
       with the rest of her un-recycled garbage.  Freezing
       in horror, MOM then lunges for MRS. ACKERMAN's
       gleaming sewing scissors in borrowed sewing basket
       and begins to run out door.

       Suddenly MOM sees the friendly GARBAGEMEN waving to
       her from truck.  She quickly puts back the scissors,
       grabs her recyle bags, locates two "miniatures" of
       liquor hidden in kitchen cabinet and runs out back
       door.

42.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN goes back inside her house as MOM
       charges out to meet GARBAGEMEN with her recyclables.

                            MOM
                  Don't forget me, boys!
                       (Holding up blue bags)
                  All rinsed and ready to
                  recycle!

                            GUS
                  Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MOM
                  Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy.
                    (Sneakily handing them
                     miniatures)
                  Here you go.  You work hard
                  for the environment.  A little
                  drink never hurt anybody.

                            SLOPPY
                  Thanks, ma'am.
                       (Takes a big swig)
                  Damn!  Good stuff.
                   (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's
                    garbage)
                  Do you believe that goddamn
                  litterbugger?

                            MOM
                       (Fingering a tin can)
                  I've told her!  It takes ninety
                  to one hundred years for a tin
                  can to decompose but she still
                  won't recycle.

                            GUS
                       (Also taking a guzzle)
                  Cost taxpayers millions of
                  dollars last year but she don't
                  care about the national budget!

                            MOM
                       (Deadly serious)
                  I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" begins building on soundtrack.

                            GUS
                    (Drinking, encouraging her)
                  I hate her too.

                            SLOPPY
                   (Getting tipsy, joining
                    the bull session)
                  I HATE HER GUTS!
                   (Egging MOM on, laughing)
                  Somebody ought to kill her!

                            GUS
                       (Joking and drinking)
                  Yeah, hack her up and recycle
                  her!

                            MOM
                       (Not kidding, in a trance)
                  For the sake of this planet,
                  SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT!

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" climaxes on soundtrack.

43.    INTERIOR ROSEMARY ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is serving brunch to DOTTIE HINKLE as
       they drink beer together and watch "The Joan Rivers
       Show" on TV as JOAN interviews a fat woman in her
       20's.

                            JOAN
                       (On TV)
                  ...But your boyfriend was
                  convicted of killing twelve
                  people

                            HAG
                  I don't judge him.

       TV audience groans.

                            JOAN
                  How can you love a
                  mass-murderer?

                            HAG
                  Easy!  He's handsome.  He's
                  famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL
                  VISITS!

                            JOAN
                       (To camera)
                  SERIAL HAGS!  Woman Who Love
                  Men Who Mutilate!  We'll be
                  right back after this!

                            DOTTIE
                  Turn it off.

       MRS. ACKERMAN does.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Violence is everywhere these
                  days

44.    EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MOM runs up to window in a frenzy and freezes at the
       sight of DOTTIE HINKLE inside.

45.    INTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       DOTTIE looks over and sees MOM in window and
       screams.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Looking up)
                  Oh, it's just Beverly.

                            DOTTIE
                  She scared me.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Going to door)
                  Come in, Beverly.  Have some
                  coffee

                            MOM
                   (Entering, back to normal,
                    being so-o-o-o nice)
                  Just a half-a-cup.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry
                  to hear of your troubles...

                            DOTTIE
                  It's not fair!!

                            MOM
                   (To MRS. ACKERMAN, noticing
                    her flower arrangement)
                  Are those pussy-willows?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                     (Fixing the coffee)
                  Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty?

       DOTTIE freezes in horror when she recognizes the
       P-word in MOM's voice.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Alarmed)
                  What did you just say?

                            MOM
                  (Evily baiting DOTTIE under
                   her breath)
                  PUSSY-willows, Dottie!

       MOM purposely knocks MRS. ACKERMAN's Franklin Mint
       Faberge Egg off table and sends it crashing to the
       floor.

                            MOM
                  Dottie!  Watch what you're
                  doing!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Horrified to see MOM
                        is blaming her)
                  I didn't do it!

                            ROSEMARY
                        (Crying out, rushing
                         to pick up pieces)
                  My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!

                            MOM
                       (Helping MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  Dottie didn't mean to be a
                  clumsy ox.  She's sorry,
                  Aren't you, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pleading)
                  Rosemary, I didn't break your
                  egg - she did!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  You could at least apologize,
                  Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!

                            MOM
                  And we're going right to the
                  flea market to get another one!
                  Misty tells me there's a whole
                  booth of Franklin Mint stuff.
                  Dottie, you lock up.
                       (Evily)
                  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Stammering in fear to
                        MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  But...but...she...Rosemary, I
                  heard her voice!  It's her, I
                  tell you, IT'S HER!

46.    INTERIOR DAD'S DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM.

       DAD attempts to do dental work on RALPH STERNER, the
       "emergency" patient who lets out a blood curdling
       scream every time DAD gets the drill anywhere near
       his mouth.

                            DAD
                  Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny
                  filling.  I have to drill deeply
                  enough to remove all the decay.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Whimpering)
                  Alright...go ahead...but be
                  careful, it really hurts!
                       (Opens mouth)

       DAD begins to drill again.

                            MR. STERNER
                  OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're
                  hurting me on purpose!

47.    DENTAL WAITING ROOM.

       MRS. STERNER, reading an old issue of Newsweek, with
       Jeffrey Dahmer on the cover, jumps up and runs to
       her husband past the RECEPTIONIST.

48.    INTERIOR DAD'S EXAMINATION ROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Running in)
                  Are you ok, Ralph?

                            DAD
                  Mrs. Sterner, please stay in
                  the waiting room!

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help me, Betty!  He's worse
                  than the dentist in "The
                  Marathon Man"!

                            RECEPTIONIST
                       (Poking her head in)
                  Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin,
                  but there's two police detectives
                  here to see you...

49.    INTERIOR DAD'S TINY OFFICE.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD wait grim-faced in the
       office.  Subtitle appears "10:35am" and fades out.

                            DAD
                       (Entering)
                  What is it, officers?
                  My patient is waiting.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Dr. Sutphing is your wife a
                  big reader?

                            DAD
                  Bird books mostly...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Like these we found in
                  her garbage?
                       (Showing him the book)
                  "Urge To Kill".  "Mass Murder
                  in Houston"?

                            DAD
                  I'm sure those are my son,
                  Chip's books.

                            DET. MOORE
                  No, they're your wife's.  We
                  checked,  She bought them
                  down at "The Browse and Learn
                  Bookshop" along with a few other
                  titles...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Reading from notes)

                  Master Card reference number 7876.
                  Dated June 5th.

                            DAD
                       (Seeing their suspicions
                        of MOM are serious)
                  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Dr. Sutphin, is you wife mental?

50.    OUTDOOR FLEA MARKET.  EDMONSON DRIVE-IN THEATER.

       Cut to MOM's face, seemingly in the middle of a
       frenzy as she jumps around like a crazy person.
       Camera pulls back and we see that she is swatting
       away a persistent bee as she sits with MISTY at her
       flea market table.

       Subtitle appears "11:20am" and then disappears.
         
                            MOM
                  Damn these yellow-jackets!
                  I hate 'em!

                            MISTY
                       (Angrily)
                  Always something isn't it?
                       (To CUSTOMER)
                  Can I help you?

                            CUSTOMER
                  Just looking.
                        (Walks away)

                            MISTY
                  Thanks for not buying anything!

                            MOM
                  Misty, lighten up.  It's not
                  the customer's fault Carl stood
                  you up!

       MOM looks over two rows and sees CARL walking
       through the flea market with a SEXPOT DATE.  Her
       face turns to stone but she doesn't let on to MISTY.

       Cut to MRS. ACKERMAN shopping passionately at the
       nearby Franklin Mint booth.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Young man, this Faberge Egg is
                  chipped.

                            VENDOR
                  Yes, ma'am, it is.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll give you fifty cents.

                            VENDOR
                  That's a Franklin Mint piece.
                  Eight dollars.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint
                  or not, it's damaged goods!
                       (Puts it back)

       MRS. ACKERMAN bends over grumbling and sees a fire
       poker marked with a price tag of $6.O0.  Sneakily
       she switches price tag of $3.00 from another item.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll take this instead.

                            VENDOR
                  Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming.
                       (Looking at price
                        momentarily hesit'ating)
                  Three dollars?...I guess that's
                  what I marked it...

       MRS. ACKERMAN smirks and pays him.

       MRS. ACKERMAN comes back to MISTY's booth carrying
       fire poker.

                            MOM
                  (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN1s
                   purchase, but still watching
                   CARL and SEXPOT DATE in distance)
                  Did you find your Franklin Mint
                  egg, Rosemary darling?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I saw one, but it was ridiculously
                  overpriced!

                            MOM
                       (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN's
                        fire poker)
                  You want me to keep that under
                  the table for you?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  If you wouldn't mind...
                       (Gives it to her)
                  It was on sale.

       Cut to CARL browsing at same Franklin Mint booth
       that MRS. ACKERMAN was shopping in earlier.  SEXPOT
       DATE is drooling over chipped Faberge Egg and
       batting her eyes at CARL.

                            SEXPOT DATE
                       (In baby talk)
                  Honey, pleeease?  For my little
                  knick-knack shelf?

                            CARL
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Wrap it up for the little
                  lady.

       Cut to MOM with the fire poker partially concealed
       under her coat as she stalks CARL and SEXPOT DATE to
       baseball memorabilia booth.  MOM pretends to shop
       nearby as CARL buys Oriole penant for himself.

       MOM follows them to concession stand where CARL
       excuses himself for a quick trip to the men's room.
       SEXPOT DATE adjusts her cleavage as she waits, much
       to the embarrassment of YOUNG BOY walking by.

       Realizing the coast is clear, MOM darts into men's
       room following CARL.

51.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       CARL is at urinal.  Subtitle appears "11:57am" and
       fades out.  MOM rushes in unnoticed and tries to
       enter first booth and finds it locked,  She scurries
       to next booth and enters.

       A male PERVERT in locked booth is drawing dirty
       pictures on the wall.  He looks down and sees MOM's
       shoes under the stall and starts moaning sexually as
       he writes "EAT ME" with a magic marker.

       Closeup of CARL's face as he pisses like a
       racehorse.

       PERVERT looks through peep-hole between booths and
       sees MOM and moans in silent orgasm.

       MOM pulls fire poker out from under her coat.

       PERVERT zips up in a panic and flees bathroom in
       fear.

       Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker
       drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal.

       CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker
       with his liver skewered on the end.

       CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in
       urinal.

       MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake
       it off poker, panicked that someone will come into
       men's room.

       Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver
       with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

       Running from men's room, she slips in gore, catches
       her balance, looks back at CARL's head in urinal,
       hesitates and finally runs back to flush toilet
       before escaping undetected.

52.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       A hip young couple are buying a hideous amateur oil
       painting of Don Knotts from MISTY.

                            BOY
                  I can't believe it!  Fuckin'
                  Don Knotts!

                            GIRL
                       (Happily)
                  It's beyond ugly!

                            MISTY
                     (Giving them back change)
                  There you go...

       Cut to MOM approaching, looking happy and composed
       with fire poker concealed under her coat.

                            MOM
                       (Calling out)
                  Misty, honey, look!
                   (Holding up a set of
                    cereal bowls)
                  I made a killing!

53.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       A MACHO MAN enters nibbling lamb off a shishkobab.
       He sees CARL's body and screams in the best Fay Ray
       tradition.  Subtitle appears "l2:llpm" and then
       fades out.

54.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       MOM is showing MISTY her new cereal bowl as MRS.
       ACKERMAN returns.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Upset)
                  I went back to get my Faberge
                  Egg and some idiot bought it!

       Sirens are heard in the distance.

                            MOM
                    (Caressing fire poker
                     back under table,
                     threateningly)
                  It's just not your day, is
                  it Rosemary?

                           MISTY
                   (Seeing cop cars and
                    ambulance enter flea market
                    as customers start running
                    towards concession stand)
                  Watch the booth!  I'll be back!
                   (Runs off to join the crowd)

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                      (Spotting a small hunk
                       of gore stuck to bottom
                       of MOM's shoe)
                  Beverly, honey, you've got some...
                       (Wrinkles up her nose)
                  ...do-do on your shoe.

                            MOM
                  Ewwww!
                       (Wipes it off on grass)
                  Thank you, Rosemary.

       MRS. ACKERMAN notices stain with odd unease.

55.    EXTERIOR CONCESSION STAND.

       COPS are holding back CARL'S sobbing and hysterical
       SEXPOT DATE as she clutches her Faberge Egg while
       PARAMEDICS remove CARL'S body from the mens room on
       a stretcher.

       DET. MOORE and BRADFORD are roughly frisking
       bathroom PERVERT.

                            PERVERT
                  There was a lady in the men's
                  room!  I swear! A pretty little
                  lady in the stall right next
                  to me!

       MISTY pushes her way through rubbernecking crowd
       until she finally sees CARL'S face right before the
       PARAMEDICS give the final zip to the body bag.  She
       lets out a blood-curdling scream.

       DET. BRADFORD looks up into MISTY's horror filled
       face and turns in suspicion to DET. MOORE only to
       see his partner making eyes with SEXPOT DATE, who in
       between sobs, is flirting back with all her might.

56.    MISTY'S BOOTH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is looking in revulsion at what
       appears to be dried blood on the end of her
       fire-poker stored under the flea market table as MOM
       happily sells Pee-Wee Herman doll to New York
       dealer.

                            MOM
                  That's one-hundred fifty-eight
                  dollars.

                            DEALER
                  Will you take a New York check?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       MRS. ACKERMAN reaches down and touches the end of
       fire poker and almost faints when she sees red on
       her fingertips.

       MISTY hysterically returns to booth, crying and
       screaming.

                            MISTY
                  Mother!  It's Carl!
                  He's dead!

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks in sudden fear at MOM.

                            MOM
                  0h, that's horrible, honey.
                       (Suddenly cheerful)
                  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman
                  doll!!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Mother!  Did you hear me?!
                  Someone murdered Carl in the
                  mensroom!  I saw his dead body!

                            MOM
                       (Quietly, sweetly)
                  You got your wish.

                            MISTY
                       (Stunned)
                  But...
                       (Backs away)
                  I didn't wish...I didn't
                  want him DEAD!

       MRS. ACKERMAN gulps in horror.

57.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       DAD is frantically searching through MOM's stuff and
       finds a scrapbook which is filled page after page
       with newspaper clippings about famous mass
       murderers.  He gasps in horror and then looks
       between mattress and box-springs and finds a stack
       of letters and a few cassette tapes.  He looks in
       shock at return address of first letter - "Richard
       Speck, Statesville Correctional Center, Joliet,
       Illinois 60434".  He tears open envelope and out
       falls an 8xlO glossy photo of a naked Richard Speck
       with the inscription "To Beverly.  Love, Richard
       Speck".  Shaking his head in horror, DAD puts
       cassette in tape player and pushes play button.  The
       voice on the tape booms out in bedroom, "Beverly,
       it's me, Ted Bundy.  It's late at night six days
       before my execution and it's lonely here on death
       row...".  DAD lunges for machine to push OFF button
       and accidentally turns on the radio.

                            NEWS ANNOUNCER
                  ...Updating the top story of
                  the hour, the young man brutally
                  murdered a short time ago in the
                  mens room of the Edmonson Flea
                  Market has been identified as
                  22 year old Carl Padgett of
                  Towson...

       DAD slams down OFF button on radio and sobs in
       shock.

58.    INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO SHOP".

       CHIP1 on duty as manager, along with BIRDIE and
       SCOTTY and a few other horror-nut customers watch on
       large video monitor Joan Crawford get off a train in
       William Castle's "Straight Jacket".  The suspense
       builds as Joan on video spies through a window at
       her husband with another woman, picks up an ax and
       cuts off his head.  Suddenly MISTY runs into video
       shop in hysterics.

                            MISTY
                  Chip!  Our mother is Charles
                  Manson!

       All the kids laugh uproarously as Joan screams on
       video "I'm not guilty" while struggling in a
       straight jacket.

                            MISTY
                   (Grabbing the remote and
                    turning off the video)
                       (To CHIP)
                  I'm not kidding.  Carl stood
                  me up this morning and then
                  he was murdered at the flea
                  market....

                            CHIP
                  MURDERED?!!

                            MISTY
                  Yes murdered!  You said you
                  hated your teacher yesterday
                  and he was murdered too.  I
                  don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!

                            CHIP
                  It's a cool idea, Misty!
                  Let's make a gore movie about
                  Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!

                            BIRDIE
                  Can I borrow your mother?
                  My aunt is coming over to dinner
                  tonight and she's always on my
                  nerves.

                            KID
                  My step-father is an asshole!
                  She could kill him!

                            CHIP
                       (Baiting MISTY)
                  How about Mrs. Ackerman?
                  We both hate her!
                       (Playfully)
                  Should she be the next victim?

                            MISTY
                  No!  Stop it!  It's not funny.
                  Mom might do it!
                       (Sobbing)
                  Someone else might die.

                            SCOTTY
                       (Comforting her)
                  I believe you, Misty.
                  Your mother could kill - I've
                  seen that look in her eyes!
                           (Timidly)
                  Is there a reward or anything?

59.    DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM comes through kitchen door and serves a fancy
       tuna casserole.

                  Dinner's served!

       Subtitle appears "6:01pm" and then fades out.

       MISTY looks at her mother in terror.  DAD treats MOM
       with kid gloves.  CHIP is completely oblivious to
       their concern.

                            DAD
                  Let's say grace and pray
                  that we have the strength to
                  understand the terrible
                  tragedies of the last few days.

                            MOM
                  Amen to that.
                       (Happily)
                  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

       MISTY pales, DAD looks at MOM in fear.

       DET. MOORE and several other COPS are taking down
       every word MRS. ACKERMAN says in notebooks and on

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT
                  IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you
                  I saw blood right on the bottom
                  of her shoes!  Not exactly blood
                  - it was GORE!  Hanging right
                  there like a runny nose!!

                  Nice as pie she was to me and
                  then I hear her say it!

                       (Giving up)
                  I can't say the word out loud.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Trying to comfort her)
                  Could you tell a policewoman
                  the exact words she used?
         
                            DOTTIE
                       (Being pitiful)
                  Maybe...

       A huge galute of a POLICEWOMAN sits next to DOTTIE
       and pats her hand.

                            POLICEWOMAN
                  It's ok...nobody's gonna
                  hurt you.

                  Excuse me a second.
                       (Exits into kitchen)

       The whole family sits in awkward silence.

63.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       ROOKIE COP sits in cop car on surveillance duty
       watching the Sutphin house in eery silence.

64.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       Family is squirming in their seats in nervous
       silence.  MISTY suddenly bolts from table and runs
       towards kitchen.

65.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY runs in.  No one is there.  On blackboard,
       written in chalk is "WENT TO THE 7-il, MOM".

                            MISTY
                  She's gone!

       CHIP and DAD rush in.

                            MISTY
                       (Blurting it out)
                  She's gonna kill Scotty!

                            DAD
                       (No longer pretending)
                  BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE
                  DID IT??!

                            MISTY
                  I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Your mother may have some
                  problems, that's all, Chip.
                       (To both)
                  C'mon!  Hurry!

66.    EXTERIOR SUTPHINS.

       MOM peels out in her station wagon like a bat out of
       hell.

       ROOKIE COP looks up in shock, clumsily throws the
       car in gear and takes off behind her.  Subtitle
       appears "6:36pm" and then fades out.

67.    INTERIOR MOM'S STATION WAGON.

       MOM is driving like a lunatic,  She sees the red
       light of pursuing police car in rear-view mirror and
       floors it as she hits play button of tape deck in
       car and begins singing along loudly and scarily to
       her favorite song, Barry Manilow's "Daybreak",

                            MOM
                  "...Ain't no time to grieve
                  And it's Daybreak!!!
                  Let it shine, shine, shine,
                  All around the world!!"

68.    INTERIOR COP CAR.

       ROOKIE COP is sweating bullets speeding after MOM's
       car and grabs police radio.

                            ROOKIE
                  MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!

69.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM is "dancing" in place and gyrating to the beat
       as she belts out the finale of "Daybreak" and
       suddenly turns the steering wheel violently to the
       right.

70.    EXTERIOR MRS. HINKLE'S HOUSE.

       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.
       Hinkle's entire flower garden as she plows her way
       back to street.

       DET. BRADFORD comes running out of house and jumps
       out of way as ROOKIE COP's car skids around corner
       and smashes into Mrs. Ackerman's wishing well
       decoration in her front yard.

       DOTTIE HINKLE is held back by burly POLICEWOMAN on
       porch as she curses MOM in the distance.

                            DOTTIE
                  You rotten mother-fucker!
                  You lousy cock-sucker!

                       (To DAD)
                  Turn right on Timonioum Road.
                  Hurry, Dad!

                            CHIP
                   (Scared for the first time)
                  If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will
                  still be ok, won't he?

                            DAD
                  We hope so, son.  And no matter
                  what your mother is, we'll love
                  her anyway.

                  Suspect's family is headed east
                  on Calverton....

73.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a
       quiet suburban street.  She fixes her hair in rear
       view mirror, smiles, then takes out rubber
       dish-washing gloves and slips them on her hands.

74.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

       SCOTTY lies in bed, surrounded by vintage
       sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls
       ("Garden of Eden", "Mud-Honey", "There She Blows"),
       and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film
       "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.

       In the credit sequence he sees Miss Morgan
       "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that
       supposedly have cameras implanted inside.  SCOTTY is
       getting turned on.  He runs to lock bedroom door,
       closes curtain on window and then hops under a
       blanket to commit the sin of self-abuse.

75.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP pull up, run to front door and
       pound on it.

       DETECTIVE MOORE pulls up at a safe distance behind
       them and watches from police car.  Subtitle appears
       "7:01pm" and disappears.

76.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is watching Chesty Morgan on video roll about
       in hideous hot pants and insane 1970's platform
       shoes as he concentrates on her gigantic breasts and
       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at
       door, curses whoever it is, and decides to ignore
       them.

77.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD jiggles the door unsuccessfully until CHIP
       slithers through an open window and lets MISTY and
       DAD inside.

78.    INTERIOR DETECTIVE MOORE'S POLICE CAR.

                            DET. BRADFORD.

                  Suspect's family is entering
                  house.  Send backup to 2l14
                  Sycamore Street. I've got a
                  feeling old Mom's inside.  I'm
                  goin' in!

       Heroic music blares on soundtrack as he leaps from
       car and pulls gun.  Subtitle appears "7:24pm" and
       then fades out.

79.    CUT to MOM staring evily through plate glass window
       from outside a suburban house.

       Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental
       emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their
       dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens.

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  What was that?

                            MR. STERNER
                  I didn't hear anything.
                  Got any dessert?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Dr. Sutphin said no sweets
                  for you.

                            MR. STERNER
                  What's he know?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  How to send a bill!!

       They both laugh uproarously at her bad joke.

80.    STERNER KITCHEN.

       MOM is listening in disgust, notices a limp plant,
       waters it thoughtfully and then jumps out of the way
       to hide as MRS. STERNER comes into kitchen to get a
       large chocolate pie.

81.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY has the whole bed vibrating noisily as he
       watches Chesty Morgan on video in hideous green
       plaid bell bottoms as she "photographs" evidence
       with her breasts.

82.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.  HALLWAY.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP creep up the steps towards
       SCOTTY's bedroom.

83.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DET. BRADFORD signals the newly arrived DET. MOORE
       and a small swat team in battle gear to follow him
       quietly to Scotty's front door.

84.    INTERIOR STERNER'S DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER cuts himself a second piece of chocolate
       pie and pigs it down.

85.    INTERIOR STERNER'S BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Yelling downstairs)
                  Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s
                  on!!

       As MRS. STERNER continues to watch TV we see her get
       ready for bed.

       We see her change from her shoes to bedroom slippers
       from under the bed.

       We see her brush her hair from behind the mirror.

       We see her open her drawer and take out
       birth-control foam from inside the bureau.

       We see her go to closed curtains moving ominously in
       the breeze and close the window from the other side.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Calling out)
                  Ralph, you're missing it!

       MRS. STERNER takes off her dress to reveal monstrous
       white all-in-one bra and girdle and moves to closet
       door.

       She opens closet door and hesitates.

       We see shoe in bottom of closet move slightly.

       Suddenly a mouse scurries out of shoe and runs
       across floor as MRS. STERNER screams,

86.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

                            MR. STERNER
                    (As chocolate oozes in his
                     mouth)
                  What is it, Betty?

87.    STERNER BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Still shaking)
                  We have mice!  I mean it,
                  Ralph!  I saw one!

       MRS. STERNER reaches for nightgown and pulls it off
       hanger to reveal MOM's insane face.  Suddenly MOM
       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Scarily)
                  Always brush after every meal!

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.

88.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears
       loud thud from upstairs.  He gets up from table.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Calling upstairs)
                  Betty?

89.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MRS. STERNER is dead on the floor with scissors
       sticking out of her as MOM attempts to clean up the
       blood with the household product, "SHOUT".

90.    HALLWAY STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs up stairs, suddenly alarmed.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Betty?  Betty, answer me!

91.    STERNER BEDROOM

       MOM looks up from cleaning and smiles as MR. STERNER
       runs in, sees the grisly sight and screams in
       horror.

                            MOM
                     (Holding up bottle of "SHOUT"
                      and doing mock TV-ad)
                  "SHOUT IT OUT".

       MOM suddenly pulls scissors out of MRS. STERNER's
       stomach and expertly throws them like a knife at MR.
       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

92.    HALLWAY.  STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs down the steps screaming as MOM
       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

       Thinking fast, MR. STERNER grabs scissors from wall
       and throws them back at MOM.  She ducks in the nick
       of time and her face goes purple with rage.

                            MOM
                  You'll pay for that, Ralph
                  Sterner!!

       As MR. STERNER runs to back door, MOM charges back
       up the steps to bedroom.

93.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM rushes in and watches MR. STERNER from above
       from bedroom window as he runs out of house.

94.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER runs across lawn screaming.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help!  POLICE!!

95.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM is rocking air conditioner in window back and
       forth until she gets it loose.  Seeing him right
       below, MOM shoves it out window with all her might.

96.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER looks up at air conditioner falling from
       above and screams the second before he is crushed
       like an insect.

97.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is moaning in orgasm as he watches ludicrous
       Chesty Morgan "Secret Agent" breast footage on video
       screen.

98.    OUTSIDE SCOTTY'S BEDROOM DOOR.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP look at one another in horror
       thinking SCOTTY's moans are cries of pain and they
       break down his door to save him.

99.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the
       Sutphin family catch him in the middle of an orgasm.

       When DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and their
       ridiculously overprepared SWAT TEAM flood the
       bedroom, screaming "FREEZE" and "HANDS OVER YOUR
       HEAD", SCOTTY fumes in anger as MISTY and CHIP
       giggle in relief and DAD turns red in embarrassment.

100.   Wipe to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       DAD's car pulls up and the relieved Sutphin family
       hops out and runs to house.  Subtitle appears
       "9:02pm" and fades out.

                            DAD

                  I can't believe I thought my
                  own mother was a murderess!

                            CHIP
                  I'm disappointed she isn't!
                       (In wonder)
                  For a while there, it was like
                  being in a movie!

101.   SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM is seated happily at table.  DAD, MISTY and CHIP

103.   EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MOM, DAD, CHIP and MISTY walk out front door dressed
       in their Sunday finest.  Suddenly their wholesome
       smiles freeze on their faces.

       Cop cars are everywhere watching MOM's every move.
       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD smile hatefully at
       MOM, pressuring her with their high-visibility
       surveillance.

       The family nervously gets in their car and DAD turns
       the ignition.

       Cop after cop after cop start up their engines.

       As DAD pulls out of the driveway in his car the cops
       file into a procession of intimidation behind him.

                  Just ignore the police.
                  It's all a terrible mistake.

       He turns on radio to music.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (To DET. MOORE)
                  She may be Beaver Cleaver's
                  mother...but Jim Jones and the
                  entire People's Temple just
                  fucked her!

107.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR.

       MISTY, CHIP and DAD listen in appalled silence to
       news report on radio as MOM seems unfazed.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...the senseless killing last
                  night of Towson couple, Ralph
                  and Betty Sterner, brings to a
                  total of four murders police
                  feel may have been committed by
                  Baltimore's first serial killer...

       DAD looks at MOM in stunned disbelief.

                            DAD
                  Beverly!  Not the Sterners!

                            MOM
                       (Calmly)
                  It's a shame.  But they should
                  brush their teeth, honey.

                            ANNOUNCER
                       (On radio)
                  This just came in.  Police
                  Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has
                  publicly named a suspect in the
                  serial killer case and it's a
                  shocker!  She, that's right, she
                  has been identified as Beverly R.
                  Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...

                            MISTY
                  Oh God!
                       (In despair)
                  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!

                            DAD
                       (Nervously)
                  Beverly, I've been reading all
                  about it...is it menopause?

                            MOM
                  Oh, honey!

                            CHIP
                  Tell me the truth, Mom!
                  It's ok with me, really!  Are
                  you a serial killer?

                            MOM
                  Chip, the only cereal I know
                  about is Rice Krispies.

       Sutphin car pulls to a stop at a red light next to
       car full of churchgoers.  MOM turns to smile at them
       and all the churchgoers scream in horror at the
       sight of her face.

                            DAD
                       (Lovingly, painfully)
                  Don't worry, Beverly.  We're
                  going to get you good psychiatric
                  help.

108.   EXTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE look up in amazement
       as they see the Sutphins pull into church parking
       lot followed by string of police cars.

       The Sutphins nervously get out of car and walk
       towards church as the good Christian families glare
       at them and gossip with a vengeance.

       DAD tries to be brave, MISTY hangs her head in
       mortification, CHIP is excited by all the attention
       and MOM smiles happily to appalled worshippers.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the two garbagemen, dressed in their
       shabby church clothes wave to MOM in secret
       admiration.

       BIRDIE's eyes light up at seeing CHIP but her
       suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she
       tries to join him.  She mouths "I love you" to him
       as CHIP looks back to her parents with hurt and
       confusion.

       As the SUTPHIN family reaches the church door, a
       reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.

                            REPORTER
                       (To MOM)
                  So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me!
                  Are you "Serial Mom"?

                            MOM
                  Who?

                            DAD
                   (Blocking his face from
                    strobing flash)
                  No comment!

                            CHIP
                      (To himself)
                  "Serial Mom"?
                   (He looks at his MOM who is
                    perversely enjoying the
                    attention)
                  WOW!

       MISTY, who can't help but notice that the REPORTER
       is strikingly handsome, gives him an obviously
       flirtatious smile before DAD yanks her into church
       with the rest of them.

109.   INTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE, a mild and kind looking Episcopal
       priest has just begun the service.

                            FATHER STONE
                       (On altar)
                  Blessed be God, Father, Son and
                  Holy Spirit...

                            ALL
                  And blessed be His kingdom, now
                  and forever.  Amen...

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.

110.   EXTERIOR CHURCH.

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS
       outside their cars as voice comes over police radio.

                            CAPTAIN JOHNSON
                  This is Captain Johnson from
                  Homicide.  Lab reports confirm
                  Sutphin latent print of index
                  finger on true-crime book matches
                  those latent prints lifted from
                  murder weapons.  Bingo, boys!
                  Bust the bitch!
         
       COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately
       spread out and approach the church.

111.   INTERIOR CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...Jesus said nothing to condemn
                  capital punishment as he hung on
                  the cross, did He?!

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious
       agreement.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...If ever there was a time to
                  go on record against the death
                  penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...

       DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and
       CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM
       continues her defiant smile.

                            FATHER STONE
                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the
                  LAW in the State of Maryland!...

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,
                  FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST
                  DO IT!!

                            ALL
                  AMEN!

                            FATHER STONE
                  Now, let us pray and humbly
                  confess our sins unto Almighty
                  God.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.

                            CONGREGATION
                  ...Most merciful God, we confess
                  that we have sinned against thee...

                            CHIP and MISTY
                  ...by what we have done...

                            BIRDIE & PARENTS
                  ...and by what we have left undone...

                            DAD
                  ...we are truly sorry and we
                  humbly repent...

                            MOM
                   (Praying piously, but beginning
                     to sniffle a sneeze)
                  ...so that we may delight in thy
                  will...

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of
       MOM stares back at MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...And walk in the ways to
                  the glory...
                   (Starts to sneeze and
                    catches herself)
                  ...of Thy name...

                            ALL
                  Amen!

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.

                            SCOTTY
                  THERE SHE IS!!

       MOM blows a quick kiss to GUS and SLOPPY who beam in
       happiness at helping her escape.

112.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are "hot-wiring" SCOTTY's car as MOM
       lies hidden out of view on back seat of car.

113.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

                            CHIP
                  We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll
                  go on "60 Minutes"!

       The car engine starts up.

                            BIRDIE
                  Alright
                       (To MOM)
                  You're bigger than Jason or
                  Freddie now!
                      (In wonderment)
                  Only you're a real person!

                            MOM
                       (Innocently)
                  Do you think I'll need
                  a lawyer?

                            CHIP
                     (Putting on his seat belt)
                  You need an AGENT!

       CHIP peels out.

114.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       REPORTER has chased DAD and MISTY to their car,
       still taking pictures as COPS flood the area looking
       for MOM.

                            DAD
                  NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My
                  wife is missing!  I'm worried
                  sick about her!
                       (Gets in car)

                            REPORTER
                  Hey, Misty!  Just a few more
                  shots, Ok?  I'm Hank Hawkins
                  from the Baltimore Sun.

                        and posing)
                  Hi, Hank.

                            DAD
                        (Appalled, opening
                         passenger door
                         from inside)
                  MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS
                  CAR!!

115.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hurry MOM from car and run to door
       of shop as CHIP fumbles for his keys to open up.

116.   INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hustle MOM into the shop and lead
       her to the "Gore" section and open a door covered
       with violent video display boxes to reveal a small
       closet.

                            CHIP
                  In here, Mom...

                            MOM
                  But, Chip...

       CUSTOMER begins banging on door.

                            CHIP
                  Get in, Mom!  I have to open.

                            MOM
                  This is so silly.
                       (Gets in)

       CHIP closes door behind her and then inserts
       cassette into VCR and pushes "Play" button.  On
       video in shop we see "Leatherface" in "The Texas
       Chainsaw Massacre" jump out from behind a bush and
       hack up a male victim.

       BIRDIE lets in the first customer of the day, a
       middle aged battle-ax, MRS. JENSON.

                            BIRDIE
                  Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.

                            MRS. JENSON
                    (Scowling at video screen
                     where "Leatherface" chases
                     a girl to house where he
                     "chainsaws" his way through
                     door as the victim screams
                     in terror)
                  Haven't you had enough
                  violence, Chip Sutphin?
                  Turn that filth off!

                            CHIP
                       (Turning it off)
                  Sorry, ma'am.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  Do you have the musical,
                  "Annie"?

                            CHIP
                    (Rolling his eyes and
                     getting the cassette)
                  Sure do.  Did you bring
                  back "Ghost Dad"?

                            MRS. JENSON
                   (Rooting in her purse and
                    handing CHIP the casette)
                  There you go.  I love Bill
                  Cosby pictures.

                            CHIP
                   (Looking at cassette in
                      frustration)
                  Mrs. Jensen, I've told you.
                  You have to rewind the tapes
                  before returning them!

                            MRS. JENSON
                       (Belligerently)
                  Why?

                            CHIP
                  Because it's the rules!

                            MRS. JENSON
                       (Defiantly)
                  I don't feel like rewinding it!

       MOM's face turns to stone in closet.

                            CHIP
                       (Exasperated)

       Hidden behind his "borrowed" car across the street
       is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He
       takes off on foot after them.

       MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops
       videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her
       recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video
       pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her
       sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and
       smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to
       "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to
       "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears

       knife on table.

       MOM bludgeons MRS. JENSON with the leg-of-lamb on

       Blood splatters the happy scene on the TV screen.
       MRS. JENSON tries to struggle up from the floor but
       MOM hits her over the head again with leg-of-lamb
       and finishes her off.

       MOM zaps the off button and softly sings to herself
       in the sudden silence.

                  "Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!

       herself on head with drumstick in between beats as
       criminal looking biker-chick GUITARIST plays her
       instrument and mock-humps it with sexual abandon.

       As horde of cop cars with lights blinking and sirens
       blaring screech into parking lot, MOM pushes her way
       up in line and greets startled kids who recognize
       her.

                  Hey, you're Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                       (Modestly)
                  I guess I am.

                            DOORMAN
                   (Looks up and sees her family
                    and COPS rushing towards her)
                  Come on in lady.  Quick!
                       (Hands her a badge)
                  Here, take this.  A backstage
                  VIP pass.
                       (Proudly)
                  Welcome to Hammerjacks,
                  "Serial Mom"!

                            MOM
                  Thank you so much, you kind,
                  kind creature.

155.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       A parents' nightmare.  Grunge-punk hell.  "CAMEL
       LIPS" is undulating suggestively on stage screeching
       out the chorus of "Gas Chamber" as they mock gasp
       for breath, dodge beer bottles thrown from audience
       and punch out male groupies who rush the stage past
       brutish bouncers.

       SCOTTY pushes his way through slam dancing crowd as
       he is picked up and bodily tossed through the air by
       frenzied mob of "body-surfing" dancers.

       MOM is racing to catch up with SCOTTY.

                            MOM
                  Excuse me...coming through...
                     (Snatches beer bottle
                      out of boy's hand)
                  Bill Flowers!  You're underage!

                            BILL
                       (Laughing)
                  Don't kill me, Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                    (Snatching joint out of
                     hophead girl's lips)
                  Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR
                  HAIR, young lady!

                            GIRL
                       (Stoned)
                  Wow!  It's her!
                       (Proudly)
                  AND SHE'S A HEAVY METAL
                  MANIAC!!!

       DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way
       through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over
       and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening
       up a crowd for DAD.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY
       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

                            MOM
                       (Hissing)
                  Buckle up, Scotty!

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the
       act.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in
       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,
       mimicking that the music is much too loud.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both
       sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.

       DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as
       they hang their heads in sorrow.

       "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks
       boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she
       smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.

       Slow fade to black.

156.   Slow fade from black to EXTERIOR TOWSON COURTHOUSE.
       WINTER.

       DAD, CHIP, BIRDIE, MISSY and her new boyfriend, the
       REPORTER get out of folksy lawyer, HERBIE HEBDEN'S
       car and follow him through crowd of hostile press-
       trial groupies, and MOM1s punk-grunge fans, feeling
       the full heat of MOM's serial killer infamy.  DAD
       wears a "Say No to the Gas Chamber" button and
       BIRDIE has turned hippy, wearing tie-dye clothes
       covered in peace signs.  CHIP, on the other hand,
       looks cooler, wears L.A. styled outfit and carries
       copy of Variety.  MISTY is obviously very much in
       love and the REPORTER seems to feel the same way
       about her.  Subtitle appears "Four months later,
       Monday, January 18th, 9:46am" and then fades out.

                            PRESS A
                  Mr. Sutphin!  How does your
                  wife feel?

                            DAD
                       (Grim-faced)
                  Beverly is devastated by the
                  charges against her.

157.   INTERIOR PRISON BUS.

       Female criminals are handcuffed and seated around
       MOM on their way to court as MOM leads them in a
       joyous and Disney-esoue rendition of "100 Bottles of
       Beer on the Wall".  MOM sings out with insane
       happiness and glee.

158.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       A "COURT TV" reporter is interviewing trial groupies
       as they wait in line to go through metal detectors
       to attend MOM's trial.

                            COURT TV
                  ...And you, ma'am, how long
                  have you been waiting to get
                  in?

                            LADY A
                    (Beaming at the attention)
                  Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna
                  be worth it!  I know she's guilty!

                            HUSBAND A
                    (Leaning into the shot)
                  We've been to famous trials
                  all over the country!

                            WIFE A
                    (Getting into the act)
                  ..Manson.. .Watergate...
                       (To Lady A)
                  Didn't I see you at Hinkley?

                            LADY A
                       (Proudly)
                  I was there!  My husband
                  thought I was crazy but...
                    (Seeing Sutphin family
                     getting off elevator)
                  LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!!
                  That awful family!

       The hostile crowd starts craning their necks and
       screaming in recognition as if rock stars are making
       their entrance.  DAD is blinded by the press's
       flashbulbs as HERBIE HEBDEN tries to stop CHIP from
       signing autographs as BIRDIE hands out "Stop the
       Violence" handbills.  REPORTER BOYFRIEND gives MISTY
       the signal and she starts crying for his exclusive
       news shots.

159.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Packed with spectators, press and security officers.
       The middle-class jury of seven woman and five men
       take their place in the jury box as Sutphin family
       take their seats in front row behind HERBIE HEBDEN
       at his defense table.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD, the prosecutor, studies evidence
       photos of victim's bodies at the District Attorney's
       table on other side of the courtroom.  He looks up
       in disgust as MOM makes her apple-pie entrance.
       Escorted by two stern-faced police matrons.
       Subtitle appears "10:00am" and fades out.

                            MOM
                     (Happily waving to DAD)
                  Hi, honey!

       DAD smiles back pitifully.

                            MOM
                     (To CHIP, BIRDIE & MISTY)
                  Kids, did you do your homework?

       They give her a weak smile and nod "Yes".

                            JUDGE
                  Quiet in the courtroom! Court
                  is now in session!

                            MOM
                       (To JURY)
                  Hello, jury people.
                  My name's Beverly Sutphin.
                   (To startled woman juror)
                  I like your jacket!

                            JUDGE
                       (Losing patience)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET!
                  You are accused of mass murder!
                  This is a court of law, not
                  a coffee klatch!
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mr. Nazlerod, your opening
                  statement.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Thank you, your honor.
                       (Approaches JURY)
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of the
                  Jury, my name is Timothy
                  Nazlerod...
                       (Smarmily)
                  ...and I hope we can be
                  friends!
                    (JURY stares back
                     impartially)
                  ...I warn you, this is not a
                  pretty case...Beverly Sutphin
                  is a woman evil to the core...
                   (JURY POV shot of innocent-
                    looking MOM staring back
                    at them)
                  ...a rotten apple, if you will...
                    (DAD gulps in sorrow)
                  ...who beyond a reasonable
                  doubt killed five innocent
                  people!!

       SPECTATORS scowl hatefully at MOM.

                            CHIP
                     (Whispering to BIRDIE,
                      making excuses)
                  Well...they sort of deserved it...

       BIRDIE pales over the mere thought of violence.

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Shhhhh!

       He looks over and sees MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND
       are holding hands and glares at them to stop.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED
                  THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR...
                  A FIRE POKER...

       MOM subtly motions to MALE JUROR that he has
       something in his nose.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...

       JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in
       embarrassment.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!

       MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still
       there.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN
                  AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF
                  LAMB!!

       JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him
       that the problem is solved.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is not a
                  woman!...

       MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer
       together to snuggle.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...SHE IS A MONSTER!!

       MOM's smile turns to horror as JUROR #8 on end of
       second row crosses her legs and MOM zeros in on her
       hideous white summer shoes.

       Wipe to a disheveled HERBIE HEBDEN, the ultimate
       liberal defense attorney, as he paces back and forth
       before JURY wiping his brow.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm
                  Herbie Hebden and you and I
                  have a tough job ahead of us...

       MOM is still staring insanely at JUROR1s shoes.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...I have known the Sutphin
                  family for sixteen years...

       MOM is frantically scribbling a note to her attorney
       on a legal pad.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...

       DAD self-consciously smiles to JURORS.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Chip and Misty played with
                  my own children...

       CHIP smiles to MOM's few heavymetal supporters as
       REPORTER BOYFRIEND puts his arm around MISTY.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...but I've found out I don't
                  know Beverly Sutphin at all!

       He is trying to ignore MOM as she passes him a note
       that says "Juror #8 is wearing white summer shoes!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...No one really knows Beverly
                  Sutphin...

       MOM writes angrily "AFTER LABOR DAY!!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...You see...
                    (He reads note to humor MOM)
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly defiant)
                  I AM NOT!

       Courtroom spectators gasp as DAD's mouth falls open.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                     (Trying to make his point)
                  Yes, she committed these
                  terrible crimes...
                       (Pleading)
                  ...but that doesn't make her
                  a bad person.

                            MOM
                       (Standing)
                  Your honor, I have a motion.
                  I would like to fire my
                  attorney, and defend myself!

       Sutphin family looks at one another, shocked at
       MOM's change of plans.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  Beverly Sutphin is not guilty,
                  by reason of INSANITY!

                            MOM
                  Oh shut up, Herbie!
                       (To JUDGE)
                  I have the right to defend myself,
                  your honor.  I've read the
                  lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964",
                  and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".

                            JUDGE
                  Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant
                  who has herself for a lawyer
                  has a fool for a client...
                       (To attorneys)
                  Approach the bench!

       MOM smiles at DAD who looks bewildered as CHIP,
       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND give MOM the thumbs-up
       sign as BIRDIE nervously flashes her the peace sign.

                            JUDGE
                     (As bench conference
                      breaks up)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I have no
                  legal choice but to allow
                  you to take over as your own
                  attorney.

       DAD looks worried and unsure.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                   (Sulking out of courtroom,
                    to MOM)
                  You'll get my bill, I mean
                  it!  A big one!

                            JUDGE
                       (To MOM)
                  How do you plead?

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  NOT GUILTY, your honor!

       Courtroom and press buzz intently at MOM's new plea.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Furious)
                  I call to the stand, Dottie
                  Hinkle!

       A vindictive and hostile, DOTTIE HINKLE enters the
       courtroom and eagerly takes the stand.  As she is
       sworn in, MOM watches her with an evil smile.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever
                  receive obscene telephone
                  calls?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Staring right at MOM)
                  I certainly did.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you recognize the voice
                  of the caller?

                            DOTTIE
                  Not at first, but then I
                  heard the same inflection in
                  a voice at a social gathering
                  and I put two and two together.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Who's voice was it, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  It was her!  Beverly Sutphin!
                  Sittin' right there!
                    (Dramatically to JURY)
                  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

       Wipe to MOM approaching DOTTIE HINKLE for
       cross-examination.

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Haughtily)
                  No, I don't.

                            MOM
                  So you weren't drunk when
                  you received those alleged
                  obscene phonecalls?

                            DOTTIE
                  I certainly was not!

                            MOM
                  You mean to tell me the
                  day I came over to Mrs.
                  Ackerman's...the day you
                  claim you recognized my
                  voice...you weren't drinking?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Flustered)
                  One beer with lunch is
                  hardly "drinking".

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE smile at MOM's legal skills.

                            MOM
                  So you do drink?

                            DOTTIE
                  Socially...I'll have a
                  beer.

                            MOM
                  So you admit you just
                  lied?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Argumentative!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait)
                  NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

                            JUDGE
                  Sustained.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Watch your mouth, Mrs.
                  Hinkle.

       Press scribbles frantically, beginning to doubt
       witness's credibility.

       MOM quickly and sneakily mouths "FUCK YOU" to DOTTIE
       without the JUDGE or anyone else in the courtroom
       besides DOTTIE seeing.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Shocked, to JUDGE)
                  Did you see her?!  She just
                  said "Fuck you" to me!

                             MOM
                        (Innocently, to JUDGE)
                  Let the record show I'm
                  just standing here.

                             DOTTIE
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

                             JUDGE
                  I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
                  One more obscenity and I'll
                  charge you with contempt of
                  court.

       DAD watches, amazed at his wife's cunning.

                            MOM
                       (Dramatically)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

                            DOTTIE
                  NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

       Police matrons lunge at DOTTIE as she leaps from
       witness box to attack MOM.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, I find you
                  guilty of contempt of
                  court and sentence you to
                  a thousand dollar fine and
                  five days in jail!
                       (To MATRONS)
                  Lock 'er up!

                            DOTTIE
                    (To MOM, being dragged
                     out)
                  YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY
                  PIG-FUCKER!

       MOM smiles at JURY and turns to wink at her amazed
       family as spectators watch, willing to give MOM, for
       the first time, the benefit of the doubt.

       Fade out.

160.   Fade in to COURTROOM HALLWAY.  MORNING.

       CHIP is pacing up and down yelling into a mobile
       phone outside MOM's trial as long line of spectators
       wait to get in.  Subtitle appears "Tuesday, January
       19th, 10:05am" and then fades out.

                            CHIP
                       (On phone)
                  ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to
                  go to hell!  I don't care what
                  Jeffrey MacDonald's people got
                  - he's old news!  We fly first
                  class or we don't do the show!

       A YOUNG MAN angrily approaches CHIP.
         
                            YOUNG MAN
                  Are you Chip Sutphin?

                            CHIP
                       (Into phone)
                  Hold on...
                       (To YOUNG MAN)
                  Yeah I am, but you'll have
                  to speak to my agent...

                            YOUNG MAN
                  Your mom killed my brother!

       He punches CHIP in the mouth.

                            CHIP
                       (Getting up, rubbing
                        his jaw)
                  That's cool...hey look, you're
                  Carl's brother, right?

                            YOUNG MAN
                  That's right.

                            CHIP
                  I'm sorry he's dead, but...
                  have you signed off yet?

                            YOUNG MAN
                    (Suddenly all business)
                  You mean for TV or print?

                            CHIP
                  TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's
                  interested in playing my
                  mother!

                            YOUNG MAN
                   (Impressed, eyes lighting up)
                  Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna
                  play my brother?  Is Jason
                  Priestly available?

       LU-ANN HODGES, pot-head witness from PTA murder is
       on the stand testifying for the prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Miss Hodges, could you describe
                  the car...the one you saw run
                  over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?

                            LU-ANN
                       (Giggling)
                  I seen that movie!...On cable!

       MOM stares in shock at JUROR #8 who has the nerve to
       give MOM a friendly smile back while wearing yet
       another hideous pair of white summer shoes.  Trying
       to suppress her rage, MOM turns to spectator section
       and happily notices the faces of GUS and SLOPPY
       smiling back to her in support.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                     (Annoyed at his witness)
                  PLEASE, Miss Hodges!

       DET. BRADFORD is on the witness stand.

                       (Looking at MOM hatefully)
                  In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Smugly to MOM)
                  You may cross-examine, Mrs.
                  Sutphin.

       MOM takes over and smiles in conspiracy at GUS and
       SLOPPY who giggle in excitement about what is to
       come.

                            MOM
                       (To NAZLEROD)
                  Thank you.
                       (To DET. BRADFORD)
                  Detective Bradford, if I was
                  to look through your trash can,
                  what reading material would I
                  find?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Immaterial!

                            JUDGE
                  You may answer.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My
                  wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...

                  GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!

       The entire courtroom bursts into laughter except for
       his partner, DET. MOORE, who looks at him in shock.
       GUS and SLOPPY laugh the loudest.

                            MOM
                  Don't judge people by what
                  they read, Detective.

       Wipe to MRS. ACKERMAN on the stand holding the fire
       poker murder weapon tagged as evidence.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...and did you ever see the
                  fire poker again after you
                  left it with Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes!  Thirty minutes later
                  it was covered with blood and
                  gore and Carl Padgett was dead!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  No further questions.

                            MOM
                   (Standing to cross-examine)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, when you left
                  me at the flea-market, where
                  did you go?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Browsing.

                            MOM
                  Did Carl Padgett buy
                  something you wanted?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I didn't want that Faberge
                  egg - it was chipped!

                            MOM
                  Carl Padgett died for the
                  Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                    (Shocked at the suspicion
                     being pointed at her)
                  NO!  I could never hurt anyone!

       Spectators buzz.

                            MOM
                       (Not letting up)
                  That was your People magazine
                  with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, but I lent it...

                            MOM
                       (Cutting her off)
                  And those were your scissors
                  found sticking out of Mrs.
                  Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Stuttering, panicked)
                  Yes...but...I didn't...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly, dramatically)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                   (Horrified at the sudden
                    silence in court as everyone
                    stares at her in hostility)
                  No...
                       (Weakly)
                  I don't have room in my kitchen...

       GUS, SLOPPY and all the spectators let out a howl of
       disapproval.  Even the JUDGE scowls at the witness
       in disgust.

164.   EXTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       REPORTER BOYFRIEND is unpacking stack of the
       "instant" book he wrote "Serial Mom - The Real
       Story" and autographing them for a line of
       housewives.

                            HOUSEWIFE A
                       (To RALPH)
                  Could you sign it: "To
                  a future Serial Mom"?

                            REPORTER
                       (Signing)
                  Sure.  You think she did it?

                            HOUSEWIFE B
                  I have reasonable doubt.

                            HOUSEWIFE C
                       (Buying a book)
                  I feel like killing a couple
                  of people myself!

       All the HOUSEWIVES in line begin booing and jeering
       MRS. ACKERMAN as she runs in terror from courthouse
       with GUS and SLOPPY chasing after her.

165.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       DET. MOORE is on witness stand being examined by the
       prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Detective Moore, did you
                  then proceed to the stage
                  area inside "Hammerjacks"?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil
                  was on fire and he fell to
                  his knees in flames.

       BIRDIE looks up from reading "Ghandi" biography and
       gags as prosecutor hands DET. MOORE a gory 8x10
       glossy photo of victim.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Would this be what you saw?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.

       Suddenly a buzz starts in the courtroom and all
       heads turn to the back of the spectator section
       where the real life star, FARRAH FAWCETT* is
       entering with an entourage to "observe" Serial Mom.

       MOM acknowledges MS. FAWCETT with a dignified nod as
       DAD looks on in amazement.

       DET. MOORE, the JURY, even the JUDGE crane their
       necks to get a better look at FARRAH FAWCETT.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Ignoring FARRAH FAWCETT,
                        trying to continue)
                  Your honor!
                       (Impatiently)
                  May the photo be entered in as
                  evidence and passed to the jury?

                            JUDGE
                  Huh?...oh yeah...YES.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Star-struck)
                  Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah
                  Fawcett!

                            JUDGE
                     (Blurting out, unable
                      to contain himself)
                  I loved you in "The Burning
                  Bed"!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                         (Furious at JUDGE)
                  No further questions!
                         (Smugly looking at MOM)
                  I call to the stand, Marvin
                  Pickles.

       MOM looks back in sudden fear at the prospect of
       this mystery witness.

166.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES, the pervert from the flea market
       bathroom has locked himself in a stall and is
       scrawling "I SNIFF JURIES' UNDERPANTS" on wall.

       A POLICE OFFICER enters men's room, frantically
       banging on bathroom doors.

                            COP
                  MR. PICKLES!  MR. MARVIN
                  PICKLES!

                            MARVIN
                  Be right out.

                            COP
                  The Judge is waiting for you!

167.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES hurriedly enters as all heads turn to
       follow him to the stand.  CHIP, who has joined
       BIRDIE and his family looks at MOM and sees her
       worried expression.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  State your name, please.

                            MARVIN
                  Marvin A. Pickles.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Were you in the men's room
                  at the Edmonson Drive In
                  Flea Market on Saturday,
                  September 19th?

                            MARVIN
                  Yes, I was.

       FARRAH FAWCETT answers a ringing mobile phone in her
       purse.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you see anybody in the
                  booth next to you?

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

                            MARVIN
                  I...um...
                       (Turned on)
                  uh...

       MOM looks at him confused, still unaware of his
       letchery.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Getting testy)
                  Mr. Pickle!  Did you see
                  anybody in the booth next
                  to you?

                            MARVIN
                  I...1'm not sure...
                   (Really turned on,
                    starting to moan)
                  ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Outraged)
                  What do you mean, you're not
                  sure?!

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.

                            MARVIN
                   (Eyes popping out of head)
                  There was nobody next to me:

       Housewife trial groupies start buzzing wildly in
       newfound support of MOM.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Losing it)
                  Mr. Pickles, you testified
                  before the Grand Jury that
                  you looked down and "saw a
                  pair of lady's shoes" in the
                  stall next to you.

       MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins
       flapping her leqe back and forth under the table,
       flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom.

                            MARVIN
                       (Lost in his own
                        perverted glory)
                  Ohhhh!  I just said what you
                  told me to!

       DAD looks over at MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND who
       have rejoined the family in court and is horrified
       to see them with their arms wrapped around each
       other, cuddling.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE,
                  MR. PICKLES!!

       MOM is flapping her legs back and forth double time
       as MARVIN goes into his own private orgasm.

                            MARVZN
                  Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up!
                  I never saw Beverly Sutphin
                  in my life!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Absolutely furious)
                  You'll pay for this, Marvin
                  A. Pickles!
                       (Returning to seat)
                  I'm turning your file over
                  to the vice-squad!!
                       (Sitting down)
                  The prosecution rests, your
                  honor.

                            MOM
                   (Giving MARVIN her version of
                    a sexy smile as he leaves stand)
                  The prosecution has proven
                  nothing, your honor.
                       (To the JURY)
                  The defense also rests!

       The spectators burst into spontaneous applause as
       DAD looks at the kids in fear at the upcoming
       verdict.

168.   Wipe to HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAM FAWCETT is giving an impromptu press
       conference to the throng of adoring reporters.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin
                  is an innocent woman, wrongly
                  accused.  A normal housewife
                  trapped in a nightmare of
                  circumstantial evidence...

169.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD is giving the prosecution's closing
       argument.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee
                  Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A
                  new face in the deck of serial
                  killer trading cards... Find
                  her guilty of all five counts
                  of first degree murder...!

170.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is still pontificating for the press.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I only hope that I can
                  portray "Serial Mom"'s life on
                  the TV screen with the proper
                  dignity that this feminist
                  heroine deserves.

171.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

                            MOM
                   (Addressing the jury with
                    calm believability)
                  Look at me!  I'm a normal
                  person just like you are!

       DAD wipes away a tear as CHIP looks at a preliminary
       design for mini-series showing FARRAH FAWCETT done
       up as MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...But I've been framed by
                  the police...

       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are now openly making
       out in courtroom.

                            MOM
                  ...and perjured against by
                  the very people I thought
                  were my friends...

       BIRDIE looks out of courtroom window and sees a bird
       eating a worm and shudders in horror as CHIP pats
       her hand affectionately.

                            MOM
                  ...All I ask is that you
                  have the courage to find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

172.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is "reenacting" MOM's closing
       argument for the enthralled press corp.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                       (Hammily)
                  ...All I ask is that you find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

173.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Dissolve to stern-faced JURORS filing back into jury
       box, not looking at MOM.  Subtitle appears "Two days
       later.  Thursday, January 21st.  3:20pm" and then
       fades out.

                            JUDGE
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of
                  the Jury, have you reached
                  a verdict?

                            FOREMAN
                  Yes we have, your honor...

       JUROR #8 gives MOM a smile.

                            FOREMAN
                  ...We find the defendant
                  not guilty of all charges.

       Courtroom erupts in pandemonium, FARRAH FAWCETT
       cheering the loudest.  MOM turns to family who sit
       stunned in seats.

                            MOM
                  I'm coming home!!

       DAD forces a weak smile as he turns white as a
       ghost.

                       (Bangs gavel in disgust)
                  Court adjourned!

                            DAD
                    (Whispering to a shocked
                     CHIP and MISTY)
                  ...What should I do?

                            CHIP
                       (Suddenly nervous)
                  Bring her home...I guess.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Mumbling to herself)
                  No more violence...No more
                  violence...

                            REPORTER BOYFRIEND
                  Think she'll like me?

                            MISTY
                       (Worried)
                  Just be nice to her.  And try
                  ...just try not to get on her
                  nerves.

       MOM rushes over to DAD, free at last and gives him a
       big hug as press, fans, even the jury cheer her
       victory.

174.   INTERIOR COURTROOM HALLWAY.

       The stunned Sutphin family exits as MOM raises fists
       like "Rocky" to cheers of her supporters.

                            MOM
                    (Graciously accepting
                     flowers, signing autographs,
                     posing for the press)
                  I love you!  Thanks for coming!
                     (Slows a kiss to newsteam)
                  Hi Los Angeles!
                     (Looking into another camera)
                  Hello Cleveland!
                     (And another)
                  And you too, New York!

       Down the hall, inside a bank of old fashioned wooden
       phone booths is JUROR #8, excitedly talking on pay
       phone.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Proudly)
                  We did it!  We set her free!
                  I knew she was innocent
                  right from the beginning!...

       Without warning, MOM slams her way into phone booth,
       hangs up the call and grabs receiver out of JUROR
       #8's hand.

                            MOM
                       (Snarling scarily)
                  You can't wear white shoes
                  after Labor Day!

                            JUROR #8
                       (Stammering in open-mouthed
                        terror)
                  No...please...that's not
                  true anymore.

                            MOM
                  Oh yes it is!
                       (In homicidal fury)
                  Didn't your mother ever
                  tell you?!

       MOM suddenly bludgeons JUROR #8 over the head with
       the telephone receiver.

                            MOM
                  Well, now you know!

       JUROR #8, stunned by the blow, struggles to stay
       conscious.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Staggering in pain)
                  But...fashion has changed...

                            MOM
                       (Enraged)
                  No it hasn't!

       MOM imediately hits JUROR #8 over the head again
       with the telephone receiver.

       As JUROR #8's screams are drowned out by the passing
       PRESS MOB, MOM hits her again and again with the
       telephone receiver until JUROR #8 collapses to the
       ground, her white summer shoes turned red with her
       own blood.

       Cut back to Sutphin family, holding on to each other
       for dear life as the mob of supporters swell around
       them.

                            DAD
                     (Realizing MOM is missing
                      in the confusion)
                  Beverly?  Beverly?

       MOM flies out of phone booth wearing a big smile,
       not missing a beat.

                            MOM
                  Right here, honey.

                            PRESS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, can we get
                  a shot with you and Farrah
                  Fawcett?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       FARRAH FAWCETT barges in and takes over.

                            FARRAH
                  Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah
                  Fawcett
                      (Pulling MOM rudely)
                  You stand here...
                      (To PRESS)
                  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...

                            MOM
                   (Trying to get on other
                    side of FAWCETT)
                  ...but please...if I could
                  just...

                            FARRAH
                    (Rudely shoving MOM back
                     in place)
                  Stay there, Beverly.
                       (Posing)
                  Smile, Serial Mom!

       Flashbulbs explode.

                            MOM
                   (Hissing to FARRAH in the
                    scariest, most threatening
                    voice yet)
                  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH
                  FAWCETT!!

       A JUROR down the hall screams in horror as she opens
       phone booth door and a bloody white shoe pops out.

       FARRAH FAWCETT looks back at MOM in sudden fear.

       MOM glares back with the face of a madwoman.

       Freeze frame.

       BEGIN.

       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

                            MOM
                  Who wants fruit salad?

                            MISTY
                  I do, please.

                            MOM
                       (Hesitating)
                  That's not gum in your mouth,
                  is it?

                            MISTY
                       (Removing it)
                  It's sugarless.

                            MOM
                       (Gently)
                  You know how I hate gum,
                  Misty.  All that chomping
                  and cheesing...
                       (Begins serving her)

                            MISTY
                  Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.
                   (To her brother, as she
                    prices a record album)
                  Hey, Chip, think I could get
                  50c for Vanilla Ice.

                            CHIP
                  I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

                            MISTY
                          (Dreamily)
                  Carl can't believe how much I
                  make at swap meets.

                            MOM
                  (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)
                  And who may I ask is Carl?

                            MISTY
                  Just a boy.  He's picking me up
                  this morning.

                            CHIP
                  Here we go again.

                            MISTY
                  He's really cute!

                            MOM
                    (Watching the cute little
                     birds nibbling seed from
                     the bird-feeder in kitchen
                     window)
                  Cute is not enough, Misty.
                  You know that.

                            CHIP
                  She sure can pick 'em!

                            MISTY
                       (Exasperated)
                  He goes to college with me!

                            DAD
                  Leave her alone, Chip.
                       (To MOM)
                  I think it's great she has a
                  new beau, Beverly.

       MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each
       hand and turns to the family.

                            MOM
                  Cereal anybody?

       Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen.

                            DAD
                  Just a little, please.  Bad
                  for the teeth.

                            CHIP
                  Always the dentist.

                            MOM
                  Chip, honey?

                            CHIP
                  Thanks, Mom.

       As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it
       lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her
       family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking
       the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing
       enough to make MOM's head explode.

                            DAD
                       (Reading paper)
                  Look at this!
                  (Reading out loud in disgust)
                  "Hillside Strangler gets his
                  college degree in prison!"

                            MOM
                  (Preoccupied, stalking fly)
                  That's nice.

                            DAD
                  Nice?!  He should have been
                  executed!

                            MISTY
                  He killed people, Mom.

                            MOM
                       (To herself)
                  We all have bad nights.
                  (Gets ready to swat, but fly
                   buzzes off)

                            CHIP
                       (To MISTY)
                  You'd probably date him!
                       (Mimicking her)
                  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did
                  you ever see "Henry, Portrait of
                  a Serial Killer?"

                            DAD
                  I certainly did not.

                            MISTY
                  You've been working in that
                  video shop too long.

                            DAD
                  And all that gore better hadn't be
                  interfering with your schoolwork.

       MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the
       rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's
       building anger.

                            CHIP
                  I do great in school, Dad.
                  (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

       A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to
       DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the
       rim in closeup.

                            DAD
                  Well, your mother's going to PTA
                  today.  We'll see what your
                  teacher has to say.
                  (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)

                            CHIP
                  (Giving a pleading look to MOM as
                   the buzzing of the fly builds in
                   intensity on the soundtrack)
                  Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!

                            MOM
                  (Moving in for the kill, hissing
                   the words in a rage)
                  Don't say the word "hate", honey.
                  "Hate" is a very serious word!

       MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody
       closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears).

       Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up
       in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack.

       MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at
       her family.

                            MOM
                  There.  All better.
                       (Suddenly all innocence)
                  Anybody for scrambled eggs?

       END OF CREDITS.

       A loud banging is heard on the back door.  MOM jumps up
       guiltily.

                            DAD
                  (Getting up from table)
                  Who on earth...?

       MOM opens door to two police detectives in plain
       clothes.  DETECTIVE MOORE is younger and more rugged
       than the older more world-weary DETECTIVE BRADFORD.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Nervously)
                  Yes?

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Shows badge)
                  I'm Detective Moore and this
                  is Detective Bradford.

                  I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's
                  the trouble, officer?

                            CHIP
                       (Excitedly)
                  Is there a killer loose?

                            DET. MOORE
                  No son, nothing that exciting.

                            MOM
                  This is my son, Chip...and my
                  daughter, Misty.

                  (Inappropriately making eyes
                   at the younger cop)

                    (Seeing MISTY flirting)
                  Jeeezzz!

                            MOM
                  Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but
                  we don't allow gum chewing
                  in this house.
                     (Hands him a paper napkin)

                     (Spitting his gum into
                      paper napkin)
                  Sorry, ma'am.
                   (To MOM and DAD, taking out
                    an envelope)
                  We're investigating obscene
                  phone calls and mail threats to
                  a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

                            MOM
                  I know Dottie!

                            DAD
                  She lives right down the street.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Could you take a look at this...

                            DET. MOORE
                  ...And tell us of anybody who
                  might be responsible?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  (As he hands note to MOM and DAD)
                  I should warn you...this note
                  contains LANGUAGE.

       MOM and DAD open note.  In cut-out letters from a
       magazine it reads:  "I'LL GET YOU PUSSY FACE!"

                            MOM
                       (Recoiling)
                  Oh God, really!
                   (Hands it back to cop)
                  This is the limit!

                            CHIP
                  Let me see!

                            DAD
                  Sorry, son.
                       (In disgust)
                  This is a matter for adults.

                            MOM
                  Officers, I've never said the
                  P-word out loud, much less
                  written it down!

                            DAD
                  No woman would!

                            MOM
                    (Seeing cute little bird
                     land on window feeder)
                  Look officers!  Life doesn't
                  have to be ugly.
                       (In baby-talk)
                  See the little birdie?  Listen
                  to his call.
                    (Imitating bird call)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       CHIP and MISTY roll their eyes in embarrassment as
       bird calls back to MOM.

                            BIRD
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

       DAD smiles proudly as detectives look at MOM in
       amazement.

4.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       A convertible pulls into driveway driven by CHIP's
       best friend, SCOTTY BARNHILL, a handsome but sullen
       red-necky teen.  Next to him is CHIP's girlfriend,
       BIRDIE STUART, a sexy tom-boy with lots of savvy.

                            MOM
                  Chip, your ride is here.

                            DAD
                     (Looking at his watch)
                  Hey, I'm late for work.
                  Bye, honey.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Thanks for your time, everybody.

                         (Sighing)
                  Bye, Detective Moore.

                            BIRDIE
                   (Leaping out of convertible)
                  Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.

                            DAD
                    (To cops, getting into his car)
                  That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut
                  just like my son.

                            MOM
                        (Fondly)
                  Good morning, Birdie.  This is
                  Detectives Moore and Bradford.

                            BIRDIE
                   (Overdramatic, feigning horror)
                  I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't
                  lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!
                       (Kisses CHIP)
                       (Good-naturedly to COPS)
                  Hi ya, boys!

                            MOM
                   (Sarcastically to a sullen
                    SCOTTY in car)
                  Good morning Scotty!

       SCOTTY guiltily looks up from vintage Betty Page
       pin-up mag he's reading and toots horn defiantly in
       response as MOM grits her teeth.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hey Misty, look what I got!
                   (Pulling it out of bag)
                  A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you
                  sell it for me at the flea market?

                            MISTY
                       (Impressed)
                  Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can!
                   (Looks up and sees a Trans Am
                    speeding towards the house)
                  Oh God, here comes Carl!

       DAD pulls off in his car and almost collides with
       CARL as he aggressively manoeuvres his car up the
       driveway.

       CARL PADGETT, a handsome jock climbs out of his car.

                            CARL
                         (To MOM)
                  You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
                  I'm Carl Padgett.

                            MOM
                  Misty's date...

                            CARL
                  More of a friend really...

       MISTY looks hurt.

                            MISTY
                         (To CARL)
                  See what Birdie gave me to
                  sell at the flea market?

                            CARL
                       (Sneering at Pee-Wee)
                  That guy's a weirdo.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face as CHIP and BIRDIE
       hop in SCOTTY's convertible.

                            MOM
                   (Pointing to SCOTTY and
                    calling out to COPS as they
                    get into their car)
                  Now there's something you should
                  be interested in, detectives.  A
                  grown boy who doesn't wear his
                  seat belts!

       SCOTTY gives MOM a hateful look and peels out.

7.     DISSOLVE TO SUBURBAN STREET.  DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD sit in their unmarked police car, drinking
       coffee and filling out police reports.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Once again chewing gum)
                  Christ, that one was Beaver
                  Cleaver's mother.
                       (Imitating her)
                  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Good-naturedly)
                  Oh, leave her alone.  Mrs. Sutphin's
                  about as normal and nice a lady
                  we're ever going to find.

8.     INTERIOR BEVERLY AND EUGENE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is sitting on bed, dialing phone with a
       determined expression on her face.

       Subtitle appears: "9:37am" and fades out.

       In split screen, DOTTIE HINKLE, the harrassed middle
       aged neighbor, looks at her ringing phone in her
       living room with suspicion and finally answers.

                            DOTTIE
                           (Angrily)
                  Hello.

                            MOM
                       (Speaking in disguised voice)
                  Is this the Cocksucker residence?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait
                         every time)
                  Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!

                            MOM
                  Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

                            DOTTIE
                           (Furious)
                  You bitch!

                            MOM
                  Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

                            DOTTIE
                  The police are tracing your call
                  right this minute.

                            MOM
                  Well, Dottie, how come they're
                  not here then, Fuck-Face?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Red with rage)
                  FUCK YOU!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MOM giggles to herself like a little kid and
       immediately redials the phone.

9.     EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.  BACK DOOR.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, MOM's frumpy, brittle, busy-body
       next door neighbor, is knocking on door, carrying a
       sewing basket.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                         (Calling out)
                  Beverly?  Beverly darling?
                  You home?
                    (She lets herself in)
                  I know you are...

10.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM is laughing to herself listening to ringing
       phone while MRS. HINKLE, on split-screen, tries not
       to answer.  Finally she lunges for it.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Answering)
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!

                            MOM
                    (Disguising her voice
                       in prim manner)
                  I beg your pardon?

                            DOTTIE
                    (Horrified but suspicious)
                  Who is this?

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Wilson from the telephone
                  company.  I understand you're
                  having problems with obscene calls.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Mortified)
                  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson..
                  It's driving me crazy...I've
                  changed my number twice already...
                  Please help me!

11.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN walks through kitchen, wipes a
       finger on window ledge to check for dust and calls
       out Beverly's name.

12.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MOM doesn't hear MRS. ACKERMAN as she continues her
       phone conversation with MRS. HINKLE.

                            MOM
                   (Still the fake telephone
                    company representative)
                  What exactly does this sick
                  individual say to you?

                            DOTTIE
                  I can't say it out loud.
                  don't use bad language.

13.    INTERIOR MOM'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks up at huge oil portrait of MOM
       in ornate frame hanging over couch and calls out
       Beverly's name.  Hearing muffled voices behind MOM'S
       closed bedroom door at the top of the steps, MRS.
       ACKERMAN begins to creep up the steps.

14.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       Split screen with MOM and DOTTIE HINKLE.

                            MOM
                     (Still impersonating)
                  I know it's hard but we need
                  the exact words.

                            DOTTIE
                  Alright, I'll try...
                         (Primly)
                  "Cocksucker".  That's what
                  she calls me.

                            MOM
                   (Laughs hideously, begins
                    speaking in her scary voice)
                  Listen to your dirty mouth, you
                  fucking whore!

                            DOTTIE
                         (Ballistic)
                  GODDAMN YOU!

15.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOM'S BEDROOM.

       MRS. ACKERMAN hears muffled shouts and reaches for
       door handle.

16.    INTERIOR BEDROOM.  SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN MOM AND
       DOTTIE.

                            DOTTIE
                  MOTHERFUCKER!!

                            MOM
                  COCKSUCKER!
                       (Slams down phone)

       MRS. ACKERMAN barges right in bedroom, almost
       catching MOM who expertly snaps back to normal
       without missing a beat.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly, are you alright?

                            MOM
                  Rosemary, honey.  Good morning.
                  I'm fine.
                     (Taking the sewing basket)
                  Thanks for remembering.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's the least I could do.
                       (Suspicious)
                  I heard shouting.

       MOM opens sewing box to reveal a pair of gleaming
       sewing scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Slamming it shut)
                  Just the damn cable TV company.
                  You know how they are.
                  Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, I did.  It's terrifying!
                  The police were at my house this
                  morning.

                            MOM
                  Who on earth would want to
                  harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?

17.    EXTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE.

       DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing
       to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out
       front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on
       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then
       fades out.

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.
         
       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
         
       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

18.    EXTERIOR TOWSON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

       Parking lot is filled and the few last parents are
       entering the building for PTA meeting.  MOM speeds
       into lot and gets out of car.  Subtitle appears:
       "3:O6pm" and fades out.

19.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

       MR. STUBBINS, Chip's teacher, is winding down a
       one-on-one meeting with another mother, who is in
       tears.

                            MRS. TAPLOTTER
                  But, Mr. Stubbins, my son
                  studies every night!  He's
                  trying as hard as he can...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Some teenagers just aren't college
                  material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's
                  nothing to cry over.  Now, there
                  are other parents waiting.
                       (Smugly)
                  ...thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

20.    INTERIOR SCHOOL HALLWAY.  OUTSIDE MR. STUBBINS'
       CLASSROOM.

       Parents are seated in folding chairs waiting to be
       called in to conference.  MOM comes rushing down
       corridor and other parents greet her.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Hi, Beverly.

                            MOM
                  Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your
                  outfit.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Thanks.
                          (Snobbily)
                  It's a Liz Claiborne.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Mrs. Sutphin, where's that
                  husband of yours?
                   (Making a bad dental joke
                    and pointing to his teeth)
                  Feeling "down in the mouth"?!
                  Hohohohohoho!

                            MOM
                    (Smiling through her teeth)
                  You're soooo funny, Ralph...

       MR. STUBBINS leans his head out of classroom and
       looks at roll book as MRS. TAPLOTTER leaves, dabbing
       her tears with a handkerchief.

                            MR. STUEBINS
                  Mrs...Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Excited)
                  Right here!

       MOM goes in classroom with him.

21.    INTERIOR CLASSROOM.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins,
                  Chip's math teacher.

                            MOM
                       (Shaking hands)
                  Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.
                       (Handing him a tin)
                  A little something I baked.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Peeking inside)
                  Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank
                  you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.

                            MOM
                  Bon Appetit!

       They sit on opposite sides of his desk.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Chip is off to a fine start
                  this year.
                       (Checking his roll book)
                  Focused...conscientious...
                  participates actively in
                  classroom discussion.

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  He's a good boy.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Suddenly serious)
                  There is one big problem though.

       MOM'S smile freezes on her face ever so subtly

                            MOM
                  What is it, Mr. Stubbins?

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Spitting out the words)
                  His unhealthy obsession with
                  sick horror films.

                            MOM
                       (Relieved)
                  He is assistant manager of a
                  video shop...

                            MR. STUBBINS
                       (Cutting her off)
                  That's no excuse for a morbid
                  imagination.  I caught him
                  drawing this in class last week.
                   (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman
                    getting her tongue pulled out
                    with the title, "Blood Feast")
                  Is there a problem at home?

                            MOM
                       (Shocked)
                  Certainly not!

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?
                       (Knowingly)
                  Tell me, did Chip torture animals
                  when he was young?

                            MOM
                       (Furious)
                  No, he did not! We are a loving
                  supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

                            MR. STUBBINS
                  Well, you're doing something
                  wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd
                  recommend therapy for your son.
                       (Rising from his chair)
                  Thank you for taking the time
                  to come to PTA.

       MOM swerves car into car wash.

23.    INTERIOR CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       On CHIP's large video screen plays the ridiculously
       dated but still appalling scene from "BLOOD FEAST"
       where the madman with the corny, madeup eyebrows
       rips a girl's tongue out of her mouth in hokey
       special effects.

       Subtitle reads "4:22pm" and fades out.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are hooting and hollering and eating
       popcorn as SCOTTY looks up from his vintage
       nudist-camp magazine to watch in real horror and
       nausea.

                            BIRDIE
                  It's a sheep's tongue!

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.

                            CHIP
                  Rewind it!  Let's see it again!

                            SCOTTY
                  No!  That shit is sickening!
                  Put on pussy!

                  Look, Dick-Head!
                       (Gore scene replays)
                  SLOW-MOTION!

       SCOTTY starts to gag and tries to hide it,

                            BIRDIE
                       (Looking at screen)
                  BLOOD FEAST!

                  The "Citizen Kane" of gore
                  movies.

       SCOTTY looks at gore on video, jumps up to run to
       bathroom, yanks open bedroom door and screams when
       he sees MOM standing there with a plate of chocolate
       chip cookies.

                            MOM
                  I don't know what it is about
                  today, but I FEEL GREAT!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Gagging)
                  Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

       He runs past her to the bathroom.

                            CHIP
                  Hi, Mom.

                            BIRDIE
                  Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

       MOM looks at TV monitor and sees madman taking out
       heart of girl.  MOM smiles inappropriately.

                       (Giggles)
                  You kids.  Now Birdie, I want
                  you to have a cookie and then
                  run along home.

                            CHIP
                  But Mom, the video's not over.

                            MOM
                  No "but mom" for you, young man.
                  Mr. Stubbins seems to think these
                  silly movies are interfering with
                  your studies.
                   (Turns off video with remote)

                       (Rolling her eyes)
                  Oh, boy!
                       (Getting ready to leave)

                            CHIP
                  Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!

       SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better.

                            SCOTTY
                  Man, that one made me puke!

                            MOM
                   (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist
                    camp magazine and handing it
                    back to him like it's poison)
                  You forgot something...

                            SCOTTY
                       (Looking around confused)
                  Are we leaving?

                            MOM
                  Yes you are.

       SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags
       him out.

                            BIRDIE
                  Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.

                  Bye, Birdie.
                   (Sitting down next to CHIP
                       on his bed)
                  Chip, honey...I know it's hard
                  being a teenager but I understand..
                  I'm your mother and I love you.

                            CHIP

                       (Suddenly his buddy)
                  Can we watch that scene again?
                  You know, where he rips out
                  her heart?
                       (Giggling scarily)
                  PLEEEASE?

       CHIP looks back at his MOM in sudden confusion.

24.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       SPIN-WIPE to tomato sauce topped meatloaf being
       taken out of the oven by MOM.  Subtitle appears
       "6:30pm" and fades out.

25.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP sit around dining room table.
       MOM enters with the meatloaf and a smile.

                            MOM
                       (Jokingly)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, the
                  perfect meatloaf!

                            CHIP
                  Looks good, Mom!

                            DAD
                  Nothing like a home cooked
                  meal, honey.

                            MOM
                  Misty, I made your favorite
                  sesame broccoli...
                       (Passes it to her)

                            MISTY
                  Yummy.  Carl says if I lose
                  ten pounds, he'll take me to
                  the University of Maryland
                  Fall Mixer.

                            MOM
                       (Appalled)
                  Misty, if you want to lose
                  weight go ahead, but do it for
                  yourself, not for some boy you
                  barely know.

                            CHIP
                  Carl's a jerk!

                            DAD
                  He certainly drives like a jerk.

                            MISTY
                       (Getting upset)
                  Carl makes me happy and that
                  threatens this family, doesn't it?

                            DAD
                  Doesn't threaten me, honey.
                  I'm happy.

                            MOM
                  I'm happy too and we want you
                  to be happy.

                            CHIP
                       (Mockingly)
                  I'm so happy I could shit.

                            MOM
                  CHIP!  You know how much I
                  hate the brown word!

       Suddenly a scream from outside is heard.

26.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, the busy-body next door neighbor
       is running across lawn from her house to the
       Sutphins.
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Beverly!  Beverly!

27.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       Family is getting up from table in alarm.

                            MOM
                  That's Rosemary.  Something's
                  wrong!

       CHIP and MISTY look at one another and stick fingers
       down their throats at mention of MRS. ACKERMAN'S
       name.

       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN runs in from kitchen in hysterics.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Turn on the news!
                       (To CHIP)
                  A teacher at your school has
                  been murdered!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Murdered?

                            CHIP
                  Who?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  A Mr. Stubber...or Stubbins.

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  MR. STUBBINS?  That's my
                  math teacher!

28.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN LIVING ROOM.

       DAD runs in and turns on TV as family and MRS.
       ACKERMAN follow and watch under MOM's framed
       portrait on wail.

                            DAD
                  What channel?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  It's on all of them!

       Phone rings.  CHIP grabs the receiver.

                            CHIP
                  Hello.

       We see BIRDIE in split screen.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Excited)
                  Did you hear?

                            CHIP
                  What happened?

                            BIRDIE
                  This is so cool! It's just like
                  a horror movie.

       ANNOUNCER comes on TV.

                            CHIP
                  It's on!  I'll call you back!
                       (Hangs up)

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ..Police claim the driver of
                  the hit and run vehicle ran
                  down the teacher in cold blood
                  and then backed up over his
                  body to finish off the job.
                  Mr. Paul Stubbins was
                  thirty-eight years old...

                            DAD
                           (Mad)
                  Whoever did it should get the
                  death penalty!

       MOM yawns absentmindedly.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...So far only one eyewitness
                  has surfaced.

       MOM looks up in sudden fear as LU-ANN, the trashy
       pot-smoking girl who witnessed murder appears on
       screen.

                            LUANN
                  It was a blue car...I know that
                  much!

                            CHIP
                  That's Lu-Ann Hodges!

                            MISTY
                  She's a pothead!

                            LUANN
                  ...A blue station wagon...

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  That's like your car, Beverly,

                            MOM
                     (Glaring at MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  I'm not that bad a driver.
                     (Disapprovingly at TV screen)
                  Look at her hair!
                       (To CHIP)
                  Turn it off, honey.

                            CHIP
                       (He does)
                       (In shock)
                  I can't believe Mr. Stubbins
                  is dead.

                            MISTY
                  You said you hated him.

                            CHIP
                  Well...he was an asshole...
                  but he didn't deserve to die!

29.    SUTPHIN MASTER BEDROOM.

       Wipe to MOM finishing a silent prayer kneeling next
       to bed as DAD reads a spy novel under the covers.
       Subtitle appears: "10:45pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                    (Putting down his book
                     as MOM climbs in)
                  I can't stop thinking about
                  that poor teacher.
                    (Turning out light on
                     his side of bed)
                  Goodnight, honey.  Don't read
                  late, we've got a big day with
                  the birds tomorrow.

                            MOM
                   (Picking up and leafing through
                    "The Encyclopedia of Birds")
                  I've identified every little
                  birdie we're going to watch
                  tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

       We see that underneath the cover of the bird book,
       MOM is reading "Helter Skelter".  She lightly
       caresses a picture of Manson and closes the book and
       turns out her light.

                            DAD
                  Goodnight, honey.

                            MOM
                  Don't I get a kiss?

                            DAD
                       (Moving closer)
                  I just thought with all the
                  sadness...you wouldn't want...

                            MOM
                       (Snuggling up)
                  We have to concentrate on
                  life, Eugene.

                            DAD
                       (Kissing her)
                  It's fine with me, Beverly.
                   (Kisses her again more
                    passionately)
                  You want to, honey?  You
                  think the kids are asleep?

                            MOM
                  We can be real quiet...

                            DAD
                       (Getting on top of her)
                  I love that you're my wife.

                            MOM
                       (Getting turned on)
                  You're not bad yourself,
                  coo-coo bird...

                            DAD
                   (Gently making love to her)
                  You bring me such peace...

                            MOM
                  Oohhhh, Eugene!

                            DAD
                  Shhhh..

                            MOM
                       (Getting louder)
                  Oooohhhh.

                            DAD
                  Don't wake the kids...

                            MOM
                       (Even louder)
                  Ooohhhh!

30.    MISTY'S BEDROOM.

       We see MISTY, hair in curlers, pricing junk for flea
       market, stop and listen to sounds coming from
       parents' bedroom.

31.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM and DAD are having romantic monogomous sex.

                            MOM
                  Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

                            DAD
                       (Really turned on)
                  You're hot tonight, honey...
                  but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!

32.    CHIP'S BEDROOM.

       CHIP looks up from reading "Fangoria Magazine" and
       listens in horror to his mother's distant moaning.

33.    SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM is panting wildly, a suburban sex machine.  DAD
       is amazed but hardly complaining.

                            MOM
                  Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!

                            DAD
                  Ooh, honey, I'm ready!
                  Now!  Now!

                            MOM
                   (In orgasm, wildly thrashing)
                  Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!

34.    HALLWAY BETWEEN CHIP AND MISTY'S BEDROOMS.

       CHIP and MISTY open bedroom doors simultaneously,
       hear their parents climaxing and look at one another
       in complete horror.

       Fade to black.

35.    Slow fade in to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       Birds are heard greeting the sunrise with their
       happy chirping.  Subtitle appears "Saturday,
       September l9th, 5:3Oam" and fade out.

36.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN BEDROOM.

       MOM, dressed for bird-watching day-trip, watches the
       cute little chickadees nibbling seed out of her
       birdfeeder on lawn through binoculars from bedroom
       window.  DAD, half-awake, stirs in his bed.

                            MOM
                   (Tracking a particularly
                    cute bird)
                  There's Dede! He's my favorite
                  chickadee!  He's here every
                  morning for breakfast.

                            DAD
                       (Groggy)
                  Well, honey, chickadees breed
                  in Alaska, you know.  No wonder
                  Dede's hungry.  It's a long
                  trip all the way to Baltimore.

       MOM continues tracking the bird in her binoculars
       until she freezes in horror at the sight of MRS.
       ACKERMAN running her mouth next door to DETECTIVES
       MOORE and BRADFORD and pointing to MOM's car.

       Suddenly the phone rings with jangling intensity.
       MOM jumps.

                            DAD
                  Hello...

       On split screen is obnoxious man from PTA, MR.
       STERNER, holding his jaw in pain.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner.
                  Got a dental emergency here!
                       (Moans in pain)
                  I mean this goddamn tooth is
                  killing me!

                            DAD
                  Well, Mr. Sterner, if you
                  call my office, I'm sure we
                  can see you Monday.

       MOM starts shaking her head "No" to DAD just in
       case.

                            MR. STERNER
                  MONDAY?

       MRS. STERNER, his wife, grabs the phone.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Eugene, this is Betty Sterner,
                  He'll die by Monday!  The
                  roots are infected!  He might
                  have a heart attack!

                            DAD
                       (Wearily)
                  All right, Mrs. Sterner...
                  Nine o'clock.

       MOM's face changes to purple rage as she turns to
       hide her anger from DAD.

                            DAD
                       (Hangs up)
                  I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds
                  will still be there next week.

                            MOM
                   (Turning to face DAD,
                    suddenly stoic)
                  It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand..
                  I'll go fix breakfast.
                       (Exits calmly)

37.    INTERIOR HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUTPHIN'S BEDROOM.

       MOM's calm turns to immediate rage as she closes
       bedroom door and storms her way downstairs as "Mom's
       Psycho Theme" blares on soundtrack.

38.    CHIP'S BEDROOM

       CHIP is sound asleep.  MOM enters in a fury.

                            MOM
                    (In his ear, loudly)
                  CHIP!!

                            CHIP
                      (Jumping up in fear
                       from sleep)
                  God, Mom!
                   (Looking at her scary face)
                  What's the matter?

                            MOM
                      (Back to normal,
                          sweetly)
                  Time to get up, that's all.
                  You'll be late for work.

                            CHIP
                  You scared me.

39.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY is sobbing in fury as she sits forlornly with
       boxed up flea-market junk.  MOM enters and is
       startled to see her.

                            MOM
                   Honey, what's the matter?

       MOM looks out back window in alarm to see DET. MOORE
       snooping through her box of recycled newspapers as
       DET. BRADFORD noses around her station wagon.

                            MISTY
                  I'm stoodup!  I'll kill
                  that bastard!

                            MOM
                  Don't say words unless you
                  mean them, Misty.
                   (Starts fixing breakfast)

       COPS bang loudly on door.  MOM jumps.

                            MISTY
                  It's him!

                            MOM
                  No, honey, it's the police.
                   (Opens back door)
                  Hello, officers.

       Subtitle appears "7:10am" and then fades out.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MISTY
                   (Subtly unbuttoning her
                    blouse one button)
                  Hi, Detective Moore.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Embarrassed)
                  Morning, Misty.
                       (All business)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard
                  of the death of Mr. Stubbins.

                            MOM
                  A fine man.  A good teacher...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Reading from notes)
                  Contrusions...fractures...
                  rupture of numerous vital
                  organs...

                            MOM
                       (In sympathy)
                  What a mess.

       MOM sees SCOTTY pull up in driveway with BIRDIE in
       his convertible.

                            MOM
                    (Seeing MISTY's eyes light
                     up at hearing a car)
                  No, honey, it's just Scotty.
                       (To COPS)
                  Scotty, who doesn't wear his
                  seatbelts!

        DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY
        barge in back door.

                            DAD
                  Good morning, Detectives.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Dramatically)
                  Nightmare on Calverton Court!

                            SCOTTY
                  The Maryland Teacher Massacre!

                            DET. MOORE
                  That's not funny, son.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Did you drive your car to the
                  PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs.
                  Sutphin?

                            MOM
                       (Buttering toast)
                  Yes, I did.

                            DAD
                       (To cops, getting angry)
                  Detectives, what is this about?

                            DET. MOORE
                  I know this sounds weird,
                  Mr. Sutphin, but the Department
                  of Motor Vehicle's computer shows
                  only one blue station wagon
                  registered to a parent of any
                  of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

                            DAD
                  Surely you don't think Beverly
                  was involved!

                            SCOTTY
                       (Hamming it up,
                        pointing to MOM)
                  SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right
                  at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him
                  down!

                            MOM
                       (Quickly staring daggers at
                        SCOTTY before patiently
                        addressing COPS)
                  From what I understand, the
                  eye-witness is a drug user.

                            MISTY
                  I got somebody you could
                  run over, Mother!

                            DAD
                  Misty, that's a terrible
                  thing to say!
                    (Putting his arm
                     protectively around MOM)
                  Detectives, it's time for you
                  to leave.  My wife knows
                  nothing about this terrible
                  ...accident.

                            MOM
                       (Correcting him)
                  Murder, honey.

                            SCOTTY
                   (Picking up a "People"
                    magazine with Ivana Trump
                    on the cover)
                  Now, here's a babe!

       COPS see magazine cover with the "P" in "People" cut
       out as in threatening note sent to Mrs. Ackerman.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Suspiciously)
                  Let's see that, young man.

                            MISTY
                    (Whispering to BIRDIE as
                     she ogles him from behind)
                  Nice buns!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  "P" as in...

                           MOM
                      (Glaring at SCOTTY)
                  ...People who don't mind their
                  own business.

       DAD looks at MOM suddenly, for the first time
       showing slight suspicion.

                            MOM
                       (To DAD)
                  It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine,
                  honey.
                       (To COPS)
                  Look at the subscription label
                  if you don't believe me.
                       (Proudly)
                  I recycle my magazines.

40.    Wipe to EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is dumping all her bottles and
       newspapers into the rest of her garbage without the
       slightest thought of recycling.  Subtitle appears
       "10:06am" and fades out.

       Cut to GUS and SLOPPY, two Baltimore County
       sanitation workers as they pick up bags of
       neighbors' recycled trash and scowl in hatred at the
       environmentally incorrect MRS. ACKERMAN.

41.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MOM, now alone, is happily separating her cans and
       plastic trash into proper recycle bins as she rocks
       out singing along with the Barry Manilow record
       "Daybreak" that spins on her high-fi set.

                            MOM
                      (Singing and dancing
                       in place as soulfully
                       as possible for her)
                  "It's Daybreak"
                  If you want to believe
                  It can be Daybreak!..."

       MOM looks out through her kitchen window and sees
       MRS. ACKERMAN dumping styrofoam packing chips in
       with the rest of her un-recycled garbage.  Freezing
       in horror, MOM then lunges for MRS. ACKERMAN's
       gleaming sewing scissors in borrowed sewing basket
       and begins to run out door.

       Suddenly MOM sees the friendly GARBAGEMEN waving to
       her from truck.  She quickly puts back the scissors,
       grabs her recyle bags, locates two "miniatures" of
       liquor hidden in kitchen cabinet and runs out back
       door.

42.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN goes back inside her house as MOM
       charges out to meet GARBAGEMEN with her recyclables.

                            MOM
                  Don't forget me, boys!
                       (Holding up blue bags)
                  All rinsed and ready to
                  recycle!

                            GUS
                  Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

                            MOM
                  Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy.
                    (Sneakily handing them
                     miniatures)
                  Here you go.  You work hard
                  for the environment.  A little
                  drink never hurt anybody.

                            SLOPPY
                  Thanks, ma'am.
                       (Takes a big swig)
                  Damn!  Good stuff.
                   (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's
                    garbage)
                  Do you believe that goddamn
                  litterbugger?

                            MOM
                       (Fingering a tin can)
                  I've told her!  It takes ninety
                  to one hundred years for a tin
                  can to decompose but she still
                  won't recycle.

                            GUS
                       (Also taking a guzzle)
                  Cost taxpayers millions of
                  dollars last year but she don't
                  care about the national budget!

                            MOM
                       (Deadly serious)
                  I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" begins building on soundtrack.

                            GUS
                    (Drinking, encouraging her)
                  I hate her too.

                            SLOPPY
                   (Getting tipsy, joining
                    the bull session)
                  I HATE HER GUTS!
                   (Egging MOM on, laughing)
                  Somebody ought to kill her!

                            GUS
                       (Joking and drinking)
                  Yeah, hack her up and recycle
                  her!

                            MOM
                       (Not kidding, in a trance)
                  For the sake of this planet,
                  SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT!

       "Mom's Psycho Theme" climaxes on soundtrack.

43.    INTERIOR ROSEMARY ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is serving brunch to DOTTIE HINKLE as
       they drink beer together and watch "The Joan Rivers
       Show" on TV as JOAN interviews a fat woman in her
       20's.

                            JOAN

                            HAG
                  I don't judge him.

       TV audience groans.

                            JOAN
                  How can you love a
                  mass-murderer?

                            HAG
                  Easy!  He's handsome.  He's
                  famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL
                  VISITS!

                            DOTTIE
                  Turn it off.

       MRS. ACKERMAN does.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Violence is everywhere these
                  days

44.    EXTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       MOM runs up to window in a frenzy and freezes at the
       sight of DOTTIE HINKLE inside.

45.    INTERIOR MRS. ACKERMAN'S HOUSE.

       DOTTIE looks over and sees MOM in window and
       screams.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Looking up)
                  Oh, it's just Beverly.

                            DOTTIE
                  She scared me.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Going to door)
                  Come in, Beverly.  Have some
                  coffee

                            MOM
                   (Entering, back to normal,
                    being so-o-o-o nice)
                  Just a half-a-cup.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry
                  to hear of your troubles...

                            DOTTIE
                  It's not fair!!

                            MOM
                   (To MRS. ACKERMAN, noticing
                    her flower arrangement)
                  Are those pussy-willows?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                     (Fixing the coffee)
                  Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty?

       DOTTIE freezes in horror when she recognizes the
       P-word in MOM's voice.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Alarmed)
                  What did you just say?

                            MOM
                  (Evily baiting DOTTIE under
                   her breath)
                  PUSSY-willows, Dottie!

       MOM purposely knocks MRS. ACKERMAN's Franklin Mint
       Faberge Egg off table and sends it crashing to the
       floor.

                            MOM
                  Dottie!  Watch what you're
                  doing!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Horrified to see MOM
                        is blaming her)
                  I didn't do it!

                            ROSEMARY
                        (Crying out, rushing
                         to pick up pieces)
                  My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!

                            MOM
                       (Helping MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  Dottie didn't mean to be a
                  clumsy ox.  She's sorry,
                  Aren't you, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pleading)
                  Rosemary, I didn't break your
                  egg - she did!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  You could at least apologize,
                  Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!

                            MOM
                  And we're going right to the
                  flea market to get another one!
                  Misty tells me there's a whole
                  booth of Franklin Mint stuff.
                  Dottie, you lock up.
                       (Evily)
                  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Stammering in fear to
                        MRS. ACKERMAN)
                  But...but...she...Rosemary, I
                  heard her voice!  It's her, I
                  tell you, IT'S HER!

46.    INTERIOR DAD'S DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM.

       DAD attempts to do dental work on RALPH STERNER, the
       "emergency" patient who lets out a blood curdling
       scream every time DAD gets the drill anywhere near
       his mouth.

                            DAD
                  Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny
                  filling.  I have to drill deeply
                  enough to remove all the decay.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Whimpering)
                  Alright...go ahead...but be
                  careful, it really hurts!
                       (Opens mouth)

       DAD begins to drill again.

                            MR. STERNER
                  OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're
                  hurting me on purpose!

47.    DENTAL WAITING ROOM.

       MRS. STERNER, reading an old issue of Newsweek, with
       Jeffrey Dahmer on the cover, jumps up and runs to
       her husband past the RECEPTIONIST.

48.    INTERIOR DAD'S EXAMINATION ROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Running in)
                  Are you ok, Ralph?

                            DAD
                  Mrs. Sterner, please stay in
                  the waiting room!

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help me, Betty!  He's worse
                  than the dentist in "The
                  Marathon Man"!

                            RECEPTIONIST
                       (Poking her head in)
                  Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin,
                  but there's two police detectives
                  here to see you...

49.    INTERIOR DAD'S TINY OFFICE.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD wait grim-faced in the
       office.  Subtitle appears "10:35am" and fades out.

                            DAD
                       (Entering)
                  What is it, officers?
                  My patient is waiting.

                            DET. MOORE
                  Dr. Sutphing is your wife a
                  big reader?

                            DAD
                  Bird books mostly...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Like these we found in
                  her garbage?
                       (Showing him the book)
                  "Urge To Kill".  "Mass Murder
                  in Houston"?

                            DAD
                  I'm sure those are my son,
                  Chip's books.

                            DET. MOORE
                  No, they're your wife's.  We
                  checked,  She bought them
                  down at "The Browse and Learn
                  Bookshop" along with a few other
                  titles...

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Reading from notes)
                  "Helter Skelter", "Hunting Humans",
                  Master Card reference number 7876.
                  Dated June 5th.

                            DAD
                       (Seeing their suspicions
                        of MOM are serious)
                  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Dr. Sutphin, is you wife mental?

50.    OUTDOOR FLEA MARKET.  EDMONSON DRIVE-IN THEATER.

       Cut to MOM's face, seemingly in the middle of a
       frenzy as she jumps around like a crazy person.
       Camera pulls back and we see that she is swatting
       away a persistent bee as she sits with MISTY at her
       flea market table.

       Subtitle appears "11:20am" and then disappears.
         
                            MOM
                  Damn these yellow-jackets!
                  I hate 'em!

                            MISTY
                       (Angrily)
                  Always something isn't it?
                       (To CUSTOMER)
                  Can I help you?

                            CUSTOMER
                  Just looking.
                        (Walks away)

                            MISTY
                  Thanks for not buying anything!

                            MOM
                  Misty, lighten up.  It's not
                  the customer's fault Carl stood
                  you up!

       MOM looks over two rows and sees CARL walking
       through the flea market with a SEXPOT DATE.  Her
       face turns to stone but she doesn't let on to MISTY.

       Cut to MRS. ACKERMAN shopping passionately at the
       nearby Franklin Mint booth.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Young man, this Faberge Egg is
                  chipped.

                            VENDOR
                  Yes, ma'am, it is.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll give you fifty cents.

                            VENDOR
                  That's a Franklin Mint piece.
                  Eight dollars.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint
                  or not, it's damaged goods!
                       (Puts it back)

       MRS. ACKERMAN bends over grumbling and sees a fire
       poker marked with a price tag of $6.O0.  Sneakily
       she switches price tag of $3.00 from another item.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I'll take this instead.

                            VENDOR
                  Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming.
                       (Looking at price
                        momentarily hesit'ating)
                  Three dollars?...I guess that's
                  what I marked it...

       MRS. ACKERMAN smirks and pays him.

       MRS. ACKERMAN comes back to MISTY's booth carrying
       fire poker.

                            MOM
                  (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN1s
                   purchase, but still watching
                   CARL and SEXPOT DATE in distance)
                  Did you find your Franklin Mint
                  egg, Rosemary darling?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I saw one, but it was ridiculously
                  overpriced!

                            MOM
                       (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN's
                        fire poker)
                  You want me to keep that under
                  the table for you?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  If you wouldn't mind...
                       (Gives it to her)
                  It was on sale.

       Cut to CARL browsing at same Franklin Mint booth
       that MRS. ACKERMAN was shopping in earlier.  SEXPOT
       DATE is drooling over chipped Faberge Egg and
       batting her eyes at CARL.

                            SEXPOT DATE
                       (In baby talk)
                  Honey, pleeease?  For my little
                  knick-knack shelf?

                            CARL
                       (To VENDOR)
                  Wrap it up for the little
                  lady.

       Cut to MOM with the fire poker partially concealed
       under her coat as she stalks CARL and SEXPOT DATE to
       baseball memorabilia booth.  MOM pretends to shop
       nearby as CARL buys Oriole penant for himself.

       MOM follows them to concession stand where CARL
       excuses himself for a quick trip to the men's room.
       SEXPOT DATE adjusts her cleavage as she waits, much
       to the embarrassment of YOUNG BOY walking by.

       Realizing the coast is clear, MOM darts into men's
       room following CARL.

51.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       CARL is at urinal.  Subtitle appears "11:57am" and
       fades out.  MOM rushes in unnoticed and tries to
       enter first booth and finds it locked,  She scurries
       to next booth and enters.

       A male PERVERT in locked booth is drawing dirty
       pictures on the wall.  He looks down and sees MOM's
       shoes under the stall and starts moaning sexually as
       he writes "EAT ME" with a magic marker.

       Closeup of CARL's face as he pisses like a
       racehorse.

       PERVERT looks through peep-hole between booths and
       sees MOM and moans in silent orgasm.

       MOM pulls fire poker out from under her coat.

       PERVERT zips up in a panic and flees bathroom in
       fear.

       Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker
       drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal.

       CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker
       with his liver skewered on the end.

       CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in
       urinal.

       MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake
       it off poker, panicked that someone will come into
       men's room.

       Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver
       with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

       Running from men's room, she slips in gore, catches
       her balance, looks back at CARL's head in urinal,
       hesitates and finally runs back to flush toilet
       before escaping undetected.

52.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       A hip young couple are buying a hideous amateur oil
       painting of Don Knotts from MISTY.

                            BOY
                  I can't believe it!  Fuckin'
                  Don Knotts!

                            GIRL
                       (Happily)
                  It's beyond ugly!

                            MISTY
                     (Giving them back change)
                  There you go...

       Cut to MOM approaching, looking happy and composed
       with fire poker concealed under her coat.

                            MOM
                       (Calling out)
                  Misty, honey, look!
                   (Holding up a set of
                    cereal bowls)
                  I made a killing!

53.    INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM.

       A MACHO MAN enters nibbling lamb off a shishkobab.
       He sees CARL's body and screams in the best Fay Ray
       tradition.  Subtitle appears "l2:llpm" and then
       fades out.

54.    MISTY'S FLEA MARKET TABLE.

       MOM is showing MISTY her new cereal bowl as MRS.
       ACKERMAN returns.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Upset)
                  I went back to get my Faberge
                  Egg and some idiot bought it!

       Sirens are heard in the distance.

                            MOM
                    (Caressing fire poker
                     back under table,
                     threateningly)
                  It's just not your day, is
                  it Rosemary?

                           MISTY
                   (Seeing cop cars and
                    ambulance enter flea market
                    as customers start running
                    towards concession stand)
                  Watch the booth!  I'll be back!
                   (Runs off to join the crowd)

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                      (Spotting a small hunk
                       of gore stuck to bottom
                       of MOM's shoe)
                  Beverly, honey, you've got some...
                       (Wrinkles up her nose)
                  ...do-do on your shoe.

                            MOM
                  Ewwww!
                       (Wipes it off on grass)
                  Thank you, Rosemary.

       MRS. ACKERMAN notices stain with odd unease.

55.    EXTERIOR CONCESSION STAND.

       COPS are holding back CARL'S sobbing and hysterical
       SEXPOT DATE as she clutches her Faberge Egg while
       PARAMEDICS remove CARL'S body from the mens room on
       a stretcher.

       DET. MOORE and BRADFORD are roughly frisking
       bathroom PERVERT.

                            PERVERT
                  There was a lady in the men's
                  room!  I swear! A pretty little
                  lady in the stall right next
                  to me!

       MISTY pushes her way through rubbernecking crowd
       until she finally sees CARL'S face right before the
       PARAMEDICS give the final zip to the body bag.  She
       lets out a blood-curdling scream.

       DET. BRADFORD looks up into MISTY's horror filled
       face and turns in suspicion to DET. MOORE only to
       see his partner making eyes with SEXPOT DATE, who in
       between sobs, is flirting back with all her might.

56.    MISTY'S BOOTH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN is looking in revulsion at what
       appears to be dried blood on the end of her
       fire-poker stored under the flea market table as MOM
       happily sells Pee-Wee Herman doll to New York
       dealer.

                            MOM
                  That's one-hundred fifty-eight
                  dollars.

                            DEALER
                  Will you take a New York check?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       MRS. ACKERMAN reaches down and touches the end of
       fire poker and almost faints when she sees red on
       her fingertips.

       MISTY hysterically returns to booth, crying and
       screaming.

                            MISTY
                  Mother!  It's Carl!
                  He's dead!

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks in sudden fear at MOM.

                            MOM
                  0h, that's horrible, honey.
                       (Suddenly cheerful)
                  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman
                  doll!!

                            MISTY
                       (Appalled)
                  Mother!  Did you hear me?!
                  Someone murdered Carl in the
                  mensroom!  I saw his dead body!

                            MOM
                       (Quietly, sweetly)
                  You got your wish.

                            MISTY
                       (Stunned)
                  But...
                       (Backs away)
                  I didn't wish...I didn't
                  want him DEAD!

       MRS. ACKERMAN gulps in horror.

57.    INTERIOR MOM'S BEDROOM.

       DAD is frantically searching through MOM's stuff and
       finds a scrapbook which is filled page after page
       with newspaper clippings about famous mass
       murderers.  He gasps in horror and then looks
       between mattress and box-springs and finds a stack
       of letters and a few cassette tapes.  He looks in
       shock at return address of first letter - "Richard
       Speck, Statesville Correctional Center, Joliet,
       Illinois 60434".  He tears open envelope and out
       falls an 8xlO glossy photo of a naked Richard Speck
       with the inscription "To Beverly.  Love, Richard
       Speck".  Shaking his head in horror, DAD puts
       cassette in tape player and pushes play button.  The
       voice on the tape booms out in bedroom, "Beverly,
       it's me, Ted Bundy.  It's late at night six days
       before my execution and it's lonely here on death
       row...".  DAD lunges for machine to push OFF button
       and accidentally turns on the radio.

                            NEWS ANNOUNCER
                  ...Updating the top story of
                  the hour, the young man brutally
                  murdered a short time ago in the
                  mens room of the Edmonson Flea
                  Market has been identified as
                  22 year old Carl Padgett of
                  Towson...

       DAD slams down OFF button on radio and sobs in
       shock.

58.    INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO SHOP".

       CHIP1 on duty as manager, along with BIRDIE and
       SCOTTY and a few other horror-nut customers watch on
       large video monitor Joan Crawford get off a train in
       William Castle's "Straight Jacket".  The suspense
       builds as Joan on video spies through a window at
       her husband with another woman, picks up an ax and
       cuts off his head.  Suddenly MISTY runs into video
       shop in hysterics.

                            MISTY
                  Chip!  Our mother is Charles
                  Manson!

       All the kids laugh uproarously as Joan screams on
       video "I'm not guilty" while struggling in a
       straight jacket.

                            MISTY
                   (Grabbing the remote and
                    turning off the video)
                       (To CHIP)
                  I'm not kidding.  Carl stood
                  me up this morning and then
                  he was murdered at the flea
                  market....

                            CHIP
                  MURDERED?!!

                            MISTY
                  Yes murdered!  You said you
                  hated your teacher yesterday
                  and he was murdered too.  I
                  don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!

                            CHIP
                  It's a cool idea, Misty!
                  Let's make a gore movie about
                  Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!

                            BIRDIE
                  Can I borrow your mother?
                  My aunt is coming over to dinner
                  tonight and she's always on my
                  nerves.

                            KID
                  My step-father is an asshole!
                  She could kill him!

                            CHIP
                       (Baiting MISTY)
                  How about Mrs. Ackerman?
                  We both hate her!
                       (Playfully)
                  Should she be the next victim?

                            MISTY
                  No!  Stop it!  It's not funny.
                  Mom might do it!
                       (Sobbing)
                  Someone else might die.

                            SCOTTY
                       (Comforting her)
                  I believe you, Misty.
                  Your mother could kill - I've
                  seen that look in her eyes!
                           (Timidly)
                  Is there a reward or anything?

59.    DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM comes through kitchen door and serves a fancy
       tuna casserole.

                            MOM
                  Dinner's served!

       Subtitle appears "6:01pm" and then fades out.

       MISTY looks at her mother in terror.  DAD treats MOM
       with kid gloves.  CHIP is completely oblivious to
       their concern.

                            DAD
                  Let's say grace and pray
                  that we have the strength to
                  understand the terrible
                  tragedies of the last few days.

                            MOM
                  Amen to that.
                       (Happily)
                  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

       MISTY pales, DAD looks at MOM in fear.

60.    MRS. ACKERMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. MOORE and several other COPS are taking down
       every word MRS. ACKERMAN says in notebooks and on
       tape recorders.

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT
                  IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you
                  I saw blood right on the bottom
                  of her shoes!  Not exactly blood
                  - it was GORE!  Hanging right
                  there like a runny nose!!

61.    INTERIOR DOTTIE HINKLE'S LIVING ROOM.

       DET. BRADFORD and several other POLICE OFFICERS are
       taking her statement and trying to calm her down,

                            DOTTIE
                  Nice as pie she was to me and
                  then I hear her say it!

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  Say what, ma'am?

                            DOTTIE
                  "Are those..."
                       (Giving up)
                  I can't say the word out loud.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                     (Trying to comfort her)
                  Could you tell a policewoman
                  the exact words she used?
         
                            DOTTIE
                       (Being pitiful)
                  Maybe...

       A huge galute of a POLICEWOMAN sits next to DOTTIE
       and pats her hand.

                            POLICEWOMAN
                  It's ok...nobody's gonna
                  hurt you.
                       (Whispering)
                  Come on, let it out...

                            DOTTIE
                    (Yelling loudly, startling
                     all the cops in the room)
                  "PUSSY" she says to me!
                  "PUSSY WILLOWS!"

62.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

                       (Excited, happy)
                  You know Mom, Scotty thinks
                  you're the killer!

       MISTY chokes on her food, DAD laughs unconvincingly.

                            MOM
                       (Laughs)
                  Does he?
                       (Smiling to CHIP)
                  For a boy who doesn't wear
                  seat belts, Scotty's awfully
                  nosy.
                       (Getting up)
                  Excuse me a second.
                       (Exits into kitchen)

       silence.  MISTY suddenly bolts from table and runs
       towards kitchen.

65.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

       MISTY runs in.  No one is there.  On blackboard,
       written in chalk is "WENT TO THE 7-il, MOM".

                            MISTY
                  She's gone!

       CHIP and DAD rush in.

                            MISTY
                       (Blurting it out)
                  She's gonna kill Scotty!

                            DAD
                       (No longer pretending)
                  BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!

                            CHIP
                       (Horrified)
                  DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE
                  DID IT??!

                            MISTY
                  I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!

                  Your mother may have some

66.    EXTERIOR SUTPHINS.

       MOM peels out in her station wagon like a bat out of

       appears "6:36pm" and then fades out.

67.    INTERIOR MOM'S STATION WAGON.

       MOM is driving like a lunatic,  She sees the red
       light of pursuing police car in rear-view mirror and
       floors it as she hits play button of tape deck in
       car and begins singing along loudly and scarily to
       her favorite song, Barry Manilow's "Daybreak",

                            MOM
                  "...Ain't no time to grieve

68.    INTERIOR COP CAR.

       ROOKIE COP is sweating bullets speeding after MOM's

                  MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!

69.    INTERIOR MOM'S CAR.

       MOM is "dancing" in place and gyrating to the beat

       right.

70.    EXTERIOR MRS. HINKLE'S HOUSE.

       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.
       Hinkle's entire flower garden as she plows her way
       back to street.

       DET. BRADFORD comes running out of house and jumps
       out of way as ROOKIE COP's car skids around corner
       and smashes into Mrs. Ackerman's wishing well
       decoration in her front yard.

       DOTTIE HINKLE is held back by burly POLICEWOMAN on
       porch as she curses MOM in the distance.

                            CHIP
                   (Scared for the first time)
                  If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will
                  still be ok, won't he?

                            DAD
                  We hope so, son.  And no matter
                  what your mother is, we'll love

       MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a

       view mirror, smiles, then takes out rubber
       dish-washing gloves and slips them on her hands.

74.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

       SCOTTY lies in bed, surrounded by vintage
       sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls
       ("Garden of Eden", "Mud-Honey", "There She Blows"),
       and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film
       "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.

       In the credit sequence he sees Miss Morgan
       "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that
       supposedly have cameras implanted inside.  SCOTTY is
       getting turned on.  He runs to lock bedroom door,
       closes curtain on window and then hops under a
       blanket to commit the sin of self-abuse.

75.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP pull up, run to front door and

       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at
       door, curses whoever it is, and decides to ignore
       them.

77.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       from outside a suburban house.

       Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental
       emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their
       dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens.

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

                            MRS. STERNER
                  What was that?

                            MR. STERNER
                  I didn't hear anything.
                  Got any dessert?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  Dr. Sutphin said no sweets
                  for you.

                            MR. STERNER
                  What's he know?

                            MRS. STERNER
                  How to send a bill!!

       They both laugh uproarously at her bad joke.

80.    STERNER KITCHEN.

       MOM is listening in disgust, notices a limp plant,
       waters it thoughtfully and then jumps out of the way
       to hide as MRS. STERNER comes into kitchen to get a
       large chocolate pie.

81.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY has the whole bed vibrating noisily as he
       watches Chesty Morgan on video in hideous green
       plaid bell bottoms as she "photographs" evidence
       with her breasts.

82.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.  HALLWAY.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP creep up the steps towards
       SCOTTY's bedroom.

83.    EXTERIOR SCOTTY'S PARENTS' HOUSE.

       DET. BRADFORD signals the newly arrived DET. MOORE
       and a small swat team in battle gear to follow him
       quietly to Scotty's front door.

84.    INTERIOR STERNER'S DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER cuts himself a second piece of chocolate
       pie and pigs it down.

85.    INTERIOR STERNER'S BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Yelling downstairs)
                  Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s
                  on!!

       As MRS. STERNER continues to watch TV we see her get
       ready for bed.

       We see her change from her shoes to bedroom slippers
       from under the bed.

       We see her brush her hair from behind the mirror.

       We see her open her drawer and take out
       birth-control foam from inside the bureau.

       We see her go to closed curtains moving ominously in
       the breeze and close the window from the other side.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Calling out)
                  Ralph, you're missing it!

       MRS. STERNER takes off her dress to reveal monstrous
       white all-in-one bra and girdle and moves to closet
       door.

       She opens closet door and hesitates.

       We see shoe in bottom of closet move slightly.

       Suddenly a mouse scurries out of shoe and runs
       across floor as MRS. STERNER screams,

86.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

                            MR. STERNER
                    (As chocolate oozes in his
                     mouth)
                  What is it, Betty?

87.    STERNER BEDROOM.

                            MRS. STERNER
                       (Still shaking)
                  We have mice!  I mean it,
                  Ralph!  I saw one!

       MRS. STERNER reaches for nightgown and pulls it off
       hanger to reveal MOM's insane face.  Suddenly MOM
       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

                            MOM
                       (Scarily)
                  Always brush after every meal!

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.

88.    STERNER DINING ROOM.

       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears
       loud thud from upstairs.  He gets up from table.

                            MR. STERNER
                       (Calling upstairs)
                  Betty?

89.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MRS. STERNER is dead on the floor with scissors
       sticking out of her as MOM attempts to clean up the
       blood with the household product, "SHOUT".

90.    HALLWAY STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs up stairs, suddenly alarmed.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Betty?  Betty, answer me!

91.    STERNER BEDROOM

       MOM looks up from cleaning and smiles as MR. STERNER
       runs in, sees the grisly sight and screams in
       horror.

                            MOM
                     (Holding up bottle of "SHOUT"
                      and doing mock TV-ad)
                  "SHOUT IT OUT".

       MOM suddenly pulls scissors out of MRS. STERNER's
       stomach and expertly throws them like a knife at MR.
       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

92.    HALLWAY.  STERNER HOUSE.

       MR. STERNER runs down the steps screaming as MOM
       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

       Thinking fast, MR. STERNER grabs scissors from wall
       and throws them back at MOM.  She ducks in the nick
       of time and her face goes purple with rage.

                            MOM
                  You'll pay for that, Ralph
                  Sterner!!

       As MR. STERNER runs to back door, MOM charges back
       up the steps to bedroom.

93.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM rushes in and watches MR. STERNER from above
       from bedroom window as he runs out of house.

94.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER runs across lawn screaming.

                            MR. STERNER
                  Help!  POLICE!!

95.    STERNER BEDROOM.

       MOM is rocking air conditioner in window back and
       forth until she gets it loose.  Seeing him right
       below, MOM shoves it out window with all her might.

96.    STERNER LAWN.

       MR. STERNER looks up at air conditioner falling from
       above and screams the second before he is crushed
       like an insect.

97.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY is moaning in orgasm as he watches ludicrous
       Chesty Morgan "Secret Agent" breast footage on video
       screen.

98.    OUTSIDE SCOTTY'S BEDROOM DOOR.

       DAD, MISTY and CHIP look at one another in horror
       thinking SCOTTY's moans are cries of pain and they
       break down his door to save him.

99.    SCOTTY'S BEDROOM.

       SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the
       Sutphin family catch him in the middle of an orgasm.

       When DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and their
       ridiculously overprepared SWAT TEAM flood the
       bedroom, screaming "FREEZE" and "HANDS OVER YOUR
       HEAD", SCOTTY fumes in anger as MISTY and CHIP
       giggle in relief and DAD turns red in embarrassment.

100.   Wipe to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       DAD's car pulls up and the relieved Sutphin family
       hops out and runs to house.  Subtitle appears
       "9:02pm" and fades out.

                            DAD
                  Home Sweet Home!  Everything's
                  fine, kids!

                            MISTY
                       (Laughing)
                  I can't believe I thought my
                  own mother was a murderess!

                            CHIP
                  I'm disappointed she isn't!
                       (In wonder)
                  For a while there, it was like
                  being in a movie!

101.   SUTPHIN DINING ROOM.

       MOM is seated happily at table.  DAD, MISTY and CHIP
       enter.

                            MOM
                       (Beaming happily)
                  Anybody for dessert?
                  M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!

       Fade to black.

102.   Fade in to ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       Sign out front announces the service: "11:00am.
       Holy Eucharist Service.  Sermon: 'Capitol Punishment
       and You'".  Families stream into church.  Subtitle
       appears "10:37am, Sunday September 20th" and fades
       out.

103.   EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.

       MOM, DAD, CHIP and MISTY walk out front door dressed
       in their Sunday finest.  Suddenly their wholesome
       smiles freeze on their faces.

       Cop cars are everywhere watching MOM's every move.
       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD smile hatefully at
       MOM, pressuring her with their high-visibility
       surveillance.

       The family nervously gets in their car and DAD turns
       the ignition.

       Cop after cop after cop start up their engines.

       As DAD pulls out of the driveway in his car the cops
       file into a procession of intimidation behind him.

104.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND DET. BRADFORDS' CAR.

                            DET. BRADFORD

                  ...Sutphin family proceeding west
                  on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't
                  goin' nowhere this time.

                            MISTY
                       (Scared)
                  Dad, I thought it was ok.
                  Make them go away.  This is
                  embarrassing.

                            DAD
                  Just ignore the police.
                  It's all a terrible mistake.

       He turns on radio to music.

                            CHIP
                  Think we'll get on "A
                  CURRENT AFFAIR"?

106.   INTERIOR DET. MOORE AND BRADFORD'S CAR.

                            DET. MOORE
                  She's headed for church.

                            DET. BRADFORD

                  book with those on scissors and
                  fire poker.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (To DET. MOORE)
                  She may be Beaver Cleaver's
                  mother...but Jim Jones and the
                  entire People's Temple just
                  fucked her!

107.   INTERIOR SUTPHIN CAR.

       MISTY, CHIP and DAD listen in appalled silence to
       news report on radio as MOM seems unfazed.

                            ANNOUNCER
                  ...the senseless killing last
                  night of Towson couple, Ralph
                  and Betty Sterner, brings to a
                  total of four murders police
                  feel may have been committed by
                  Baltimore's first serial killer...

       DAD looks at MOM in stunned disbelief.

                            DAD
                  Beverly!  Not the Sterners!

                            MOM
                       (Calmly)
                  It's a shame.  But they should
                  brush their teeth, honey.

                            ANNOUNCER
                       (On radio)
                  This just came in.  Police
                  Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has
                  publicly named a suspect in the
                  serial killer case and it's a
                  shocker!  She, that's right, she
                  has been identified as Beverly R.
                  Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...

                            MISTY
                  Oh God!
                       (In despair)
                  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!

                            DAD
                       (Nervously)
                  Beverly, I've been reading all
                  about it...is it menopause?

                            MOM
                  Oh, honey!

                            CHIP
                  Tell me the truth, Mom!
                  It's ok with me, really!  Are
                  you a serial killer?

                            MOM
                  Chip, the only cereal I know
                  about is Rice Krispies.

       Sutphin car pulls to a stop at a red light next to
       car full of churchgoers.  MOM turns to smile at them
       and all the churchgoers scream in horror at the
       sight of her face.

                            DAD
                       (Lovingly, painfully)
                  Don't worry, Beverly.  We're
                  going to get you good psychiatric
                  help.

108.   EXTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE look up in amazement
       as they see the Sutphins pull into church parking
       lot followed by string of police cars.

       The Sutphins nervously get out of car and walk
       towards church as the good Christian families glare
       at them and gossip with a vengeance.

       DAD tries to be brave, MISTY hangs her head in
       mortification, CHIP is excited by all the attention
       and MOM smiles happily to appalled worshippers.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the two garbagemen, dressed in their
       shabby church clothes wave to MOM in secret
       admiration.

       BIRDIE's eyes light up at seeing CHIP but her
       suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she
       tries to join him.  She mouths "I love you" to him
       as CHIP looks back to her parents with hurt and
       confusion.

       As the SUTPHIN family reaches the church door, a
       reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.

                            REPORTER
                       (To MOM)
                  So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me!
                  Are you "Serial Mom"?

                            MOM
                  Who?

                            DAD
                   (Blocking his face from
                    strobing flash)
                  No comment!

                            CHIP
                      (To himself)
                  "Serial Mom"?
                   (He looks at his MOM who is
                    perversely enjoying the
                    attention)
                  WOW!

       MISTY, who can't help but notice that the REPORTER
       is strikingly handsome, gives him an obviously
       flirtatious smile before DAD yanks her into church
       with the rest of them.

109.   INTERIOR ST. TIMOTHY'S CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE, a mild and kind looking Episcopal
       priest has just begun the service.

                            FATHER STONE
                       (On altar)
                  Blessed be God, Father, Son and
                  Holy Spirit...

                            ALL
                  And blessed be His kingdom, now
                  and forever.  Amen...

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.

110.   EXTERIOR CHURCH.

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS
       outside their cars as voice comes over police radio.

                            CAPTAIN JOHNSON
                  This is Captain Johnson from
                  Homicide.  Lab reports confirm
                  Sutphin latent print of index
                  finger on true-crime book matches
                  those latent prints lifted from
                  murder weapons.  Bingo, boys!
                  Bust the bitch!
         
       COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately
       spread out and approach the church.

111.   INTERIOR CHURCH.

       FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...Jesus said nothing to condemn
                  capital punishment as he hung on
                  the cross, did He?!

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious
       agreement.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...If ever there was a time to
                  go on record against the death
                  penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...

       DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and
       CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM
       continues her defiant smile.

                            FATHER STONE
                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the
                  LAW in the State of Maryland!...

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.

                            FATHER STONE
                  ...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,
                  FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST
                  DO IT!!

                            ALL
                  AMEN!

                            FATHER STONE
                  Now, let us pray and humbly
                  confess our sins unto Almighty
                  God.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.

                            CONGREGATION
                  ...Most merciful God, we confess
                  that we have sinned against thee...

                            CHIP and MISTY
                  ...by what we have done...

                            BIRDIE & PARENTS
                  ...and by what we have left undone...

                            DAD
                  ...we are truly sorry and we
                  humbly repent...

                            MOM
                   (Praying piously, but beginning
                     to sniffle a sneeze)
                  ...so that we may delight in thy
                  will...

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of
       MOM stares back at MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...And walk in the ways to
                  the glory...
                   (Starts to sneeze and
                    catches herself)
                  ...of Thy name...

                            ALL
                  Amen!

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.

                            SCOTTY
                  THERE SHE IS!!

       MOM blows a quick kiss to GUS and SLOPPY who beam in
       happiness at helping her escape.

112.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are "hot-wiring" SCOTTY's car as MOM
       lies hidden out of view on back seat of car.

113.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

                            CHIP
                  We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll
                  go on "60 Minutes"!

       The car engine starts up.

                            BIRDIE
                  Alright
                       (To MOM)
                  You're bigger than Jason or
                  Freddie now!
                      (In wonderment)
                  Only you're a real person!

                            MOM
                       (Innocently)
                  Do you think I'll need
                  a lawyer?

                            CHIP
                     (Putting on his seat belt)
                  You need an AGENT!

       CHIP peels out.

114.   EXTERIOR CHURCH PARKING LOT.

       REPORTER has chased DAD and MISTY to their car,
       still taking pictures as COPS flood the area looking
       for MOM.

                            DAD
                  NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My
                  wife is missing!  I'm worried
                  sick about her!
                       (Gets in car)

                            REPORTER
                  Hey, Misty!  Just a few more
                  shots, Ok?  I'm Hank Hawkins
                  from the Baltimore Sun.

                            MISTY
                       (Flirting boldly
                        and posing)
                  Hi, Hank.

                            DAD
                        (Appalled, opening
                         passenger door
                         from inside)
                  MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS
                  CAR!!

115.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hurry MOM from car and run to door
       of shop as CHIP fumbles for his keys to open up.

116.   INTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE hustle MOM into the shop and lead
       her to the "Gore" section and open a door covered
       with violent video display boxes to reveal a small
       closet.

                            CHIP
                  In here, Mom...

                            MOM
                  But, Chip...

       CUSTOMER begins banging on door.

                            CHIP
                  Get in, Mom!  I have to open.

                            MOM
                  This is so silly.
                       (Gets in)

       CHIP closes door behind her and then inserts
       cassette into VCR and pushes "Play" button.  On
       video in shop we see "Leatherface" in "The Texas
       Chainsaw Massacre" jump out from behind a bush and
       hack up a male victim.

       BIRDIE lets in the first customer of the day, a
       middle aged battle-ax, MRS. JENSON.

                            BIRDIE
                  Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.

                            MRS. JENSON
                    (Scowling at video screen
                     where "Leatherface" chases
                     a girl to house where he
                     "chainsaws" his way through
                     door as the victim screams
                     in terror)
                  Haven't you had enough
                  violence, Chip Sutphin?
                  Turn that filth off!

                            CHIP
                       (Turning it off)
                  Sorry, ma'am.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  Do you have the musical,
                  "Annie"?

                            CHIP
                    (Rolling his eyes and
                     getting the cassette)
                  Sure do.  Did you bring
                  back "Ghost Dad"?

                            MRS. JENSON
                   (Rooting in her purse and
                    handing CHIP the casette)
                  There you go.  I love Bill
                  Cosby pictures.

                            CHIP
                   (Looking at cassette in
                      frustration)
                  Mrs. Jensen, I've told you.
                  You have to rewind the tapes
                  before returning them!

                            MRS. JENSON
                       (Belligerently)
                  Why?

                            CHIP
                  Because it's the rules!

                            MRS. JENSON
                       (Defiantly)
                  I don't feel like rewinding it!

       MOM's face turns to stone in closet.

                            CHIP
                       (Exasperated)
                  You see the sign!  It's a
                  dollar fine for not rewinding
                  and this time I'm gonna charge
                  you! $2.99 plus one dollar
                  is $3.99!

                            MRS. JENSON
                     (Slamming money down and
                      grabbing video)
                  Keep the change, you son of
                  a psycho!

       MRS. JENSON stomps to door and slams it behind her
       as MOM's face twists in rage as she listens.

                            BIRDIE
                  What a bitch!

                            CHIP
                  It's the influence of all those
                  family films.
                       (Turning to closet)
                  Right, Mom?
                       (No answer)
                  Hey, Mom??...
                       (Still no answer)

                            BIRDIE
                       (Nervously)
                  Mrs. Sutphin?

                            CHIP
                  Mother?
                    (Opens door to reveal
                     empty closet)

                            BIRDIE
                  0h, shit!

                            CHIP
                  You don't think....

                            BIRDIE
                  She wouldn't...

       BIRDIE runs to back of shop and sees opened door to
       street.

                            CHIP
                       (Panicked)
                  What's Mrs. Jenson's address?

       BIRDIE runs to files and starts going through them.

                            BIRDIE
                  ...Jenner...Jenson, Emy Lou
                  Jenson.  3511 Clark Avenue!

                            CHIP
                  That's right up the street!
                  Come on!  Just in case!

117.   EXTERIOR "SUBURBAN CULT VIDEO" SHOP.

       CHIP and BIRDIE exit in a panic and run up the
       street.

       Hidden behind his "borrowed" car across the street
       is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He
       takes off on foot after them.

118.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       A carving knife slices through leg-of-lamb on
       kitchen table.  Camera pans up to MRS. JENSON's
       happy face as she fixes herself a leg-of-lamb
       sandwich and exits to living room.

119.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops
       videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her
       recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video
       pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her
       sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and
       smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to
       "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to
       "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears
       "12:09pm" and fades out.

120.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       The door handle jiggles ominously.

121.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       A large DOG rises up next to MRS. JENSON.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  What is it, Sylvester,
                  a bird?  Shhhh.  Mommy's
                  watching "Annie".

122.   INTERIOR MRS'. JENSON'S KITCHEN.

       MOM looks over her shoulder to make sure no one is
       watching and then slowly lets herself in kitchen
       door.  Her eyes immediately go to gleaming butcher
       knife on table.

123.   INTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S LIVING ROOM.

       The DOG growls.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  Quiet, Sylvester.  Nobody's
                  there.  Shhh...Lick Mommy's
                  feet.
                       (Wiggles toes at DOG)
                  Come on!  Get 'em all wet!
                       (Starts singing along
                        with video)
                  "The sun comes out
                  Tomorrow..."

       DOG growls and heads toward kitchen.

124.   EXTERIOR MRS. JENSON'S HOUSE.

       CHIP and BIRDIE stand outside looking up at house in
       fear.

                            CHIP
                       (To BIRDIE)
                  Come on!

       They sneak to side of house.

       Cut to SCOTTY watching them from a distance.

125.   INTERIOR JENSON KITCHEN.

       MOM is down on floor with mean DOG getting him to
       roll over and "beg" for her with gusto as "Annie"
       soundtrack blares from living room.

126.   INTERIOR JENSON LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON is bellowing out the lyrics to
       "Tomorrow" along with the soundtrack.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  "The sun comes out
                  Tomorrow
                  And you've got to
                  Hang on to Tomorrow
                  Come what may..."

127.   INTERIOR KITCHEN.

       MOM grabs butcher knife.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are below window to her TV room.
       CHIP gives BIRDIE a leg-up so she can see inside.
       BIRDIE'S POV shot of MRS. JENSON singing along.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  "Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!
                  I love you
                  Tomorrow
                  You're only a day away!"

129.   GARAGE ROOF NEARBY.

       SCOTTY has climbed up and has a direct view over
       CHIP and BIRDIE into MRS. JENSON'S window.

130.   INTERIOR JENSON KITCHEN.

       Hand held camera follows MOM clutching knife out of
       the kitchen into living room as she sneaks up on a
       singing MRS. JENSON.

131.   GARAGE ROOF.

       SCOTTY looks horrified to see a figure sneaking up
       on MRS. JENSON through window.

132.   INTERIOR JENSON LIVING ROOM.

       MOM changes her mind, puts down knife and goes back
       into kitchen.

133.   GARAGE ROOF.

       SCOTTY sighs in relief.

134.   EXTERIOR JENSON HOUSE.

       BIRDIE gives CHIP a leg-up and he gets a glimpse of
       the singing MRS. JENSON building to the finale of
       "Tomorrow".

                            MRS. JENSON
                   "Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!
                   I love you..."

135.   JENSON KITCHEN.

       MOM picks up entire leg-of-lamb by the bone as her
       eyes light up in homicidal glee.  She leans down,
       kisses the DOG on the lips, and exits back to living
       room.

136.   INTERIOR JENSON LIVING ROOM.

       MRS. JENSON is practically leaping our of her
       recliner singing along with the finale to "Tomorrow"
       on the credits to "Annie" as MOM creeps up behind
       her with leg-of-lamb.

                            MRS. JENSON
                  "....Tomorrow!
                  You're only a day...
                  AWAAAAAY!!!"

       MOM bludgeons MRS. JENSON with the leg-of-lamb on
       the final note of the song.

       Blood splatters the happy scene on the TV screen.
       MRS. JENSON tries to struggle up from the floor but
       MOM hits her over the head again with leg-of-lamb
       and finishes her off.

       MOM zaps the off button and softly sings to herself
       in the sudden silence.

                            MOM
                  "Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!
                  I love you...

       MOM bludgeons her one more time and then pushes the
       REWIND button in revenge.

       BIRDIE POV shot of MRS. JENSON's battered corpse.

       The DOG lunges at BIRDIE in window.

       BIRDIE screams in horror and falls to the ground.

                            BIRDIE
                  I saw blood!  And it's brown!
                  Not red like in horror movies,
                  but brown!!

                            CHIP
                       (Terrified)
                  Is MOM...in there?

                            BIRDIE
                  No!
                       (Obsessed)
                  It wasn't like gore movies
                  at all!
                       (Bursting into tears)
                  IT WAS REAL!

       CHIP grabs her arm and they run.

142.   EXTERIOR JENSON HOUSE - OTHER SIDE.

       MOM comes running out front, sees SCOTTY running in

       out of hell.

143.   UP THE STREET.
         
       SCOTTY runs, looking over his shoulder, horrified to
       see MOM chasing him with a butcher knife.

144.   MRS. JENSON'S NEIGHBORHOOD.

       BIRDIE and CHIP run in fear across suburban back
       lawns.

                            BIRDIE
                  Oh God, I think I'm going
                  to be sick...

       BIRDIE vomits into the hot coals of somebody's
       outside cooking grill as horrified HOUSEWIFE looks
       out her window at her, about to begin cookout and
       screams in revulsion.

       CHIP grabs BIRDIE and they run away.

       hops in just in time.

       MOM plunges butcher knife through convertible top as
       he puts key in ignition.

                            MOM

       SCOTTY peels out, showering MOM with gravel.

       A van pulls to a stop.  Inside are two BURGLARS;
       one white, the other black.  They are surrounded by
       obvious loot: VCR's, cameras and silverware.

       MOM turns to them with knife.

                            BURGLAR A
                  What the fuck is that?

                            BURGLAR B
                  Betty Crocker gone psycho!

       MOM yanks open van door and points knife inside.

                            MOM
                       (Primly)
                  Give me your fucking van
                  before I kill you!

                            BURGLAR A
                       (Hopping out of driver's
                        seat)
                  Yes, ma'am.  It's all yours.

                            BURGLAR B
                       (Hopping out as MOM
                        hops in and pulls off)
                  Drive carefully!
                       (To fellow BURGLAR A)
                  White people sure are something!

148.   INTERIOR SCOTTY'S CAR.

       SCOTTY is speeding along, relieved to get away.

                  Dear God...I promise I'll
                  never watch a sex film again...

       speeding up behind him.

                            SCOTTY
                  Oh shit!
                       (He floors it)

151.   SUBURBAN INTERSECTION.

       CHIP and BIRDIE are running down street.

       DAD and MISTY are driving in other direction looking
       for MOM.  Seeing CHIP and BIRDIE, DAD screeches on
       the brakes and the kids run to car in relief and
       jump in.

       Suddenly SCOTTY roars by in his car with MOM in hot
       pursuit.  She sees DAD and family and blows them a
       lunatic kiss.

                            DAD
                  Hold on, kids!

       DAD takes off after MOM in car.

       A COP sees the speeding caravan as it careens around
       a corner.

                            COP
                  All units!  SERIAL MOM
                  headed south on York Road.

       SCOTTY careens into parking lot in his convertible.
       Subtitle appears "2:47pm" and fades out.

153.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       On stage, "CAMEL LIPS", an all-female
       grunge-punk-metal band, dressed in their trademark
       skin tight slacks that gave the group their name,
       perform their hit song "Gas Chamber".  The monstrous
       but beautiful LEAD SINGER bellows and snarls the
       lyrics as the DRUMMER, a brain dead drug idiot, hits
       herself on head with drumstick in between beats as
       criminal looking biker-chick GUITARIST plays her
       instrument and mock-humps it with sexual abandon.

       The audience of on-the-edge kids goes bezerk,
       guzzling beer and slam dancing with frightening
       intensity

154.   EXTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       MOM speeds into parking lot.

       SCOTTY is looking over his shoulder in fear as he
       nears the entrance waiting in line with grunge-metal
       kids.

                            DOORMAN
                       (To SCOTTY)
                  I.D.?

                            SCOTTY
                       (Panicked)
                  Can I give it to you inside?

                            DOORMAN
                  Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets
                  inside without I.D.

       SCOTTY fumbles for his wallet.

       MOM is hurrying across parking lot staring at SCOTTY
       with a vengeance.

       DAD and the kids speed into parking lot and jump out
       of car.

                            DOORMAN
                       (Looking at Scotty's I.D.)
                  Birthdate?

                            SCOTTY
                    (Straining to remember
                     information on his fake I.D.)
                  Uh...December 14th, 1975.
                       (Pleading)
                  Please!

                            DOORHAN
                  Ok, go ahead,

       SCOTTY snatches back I.D. and rushes inside.

       As horde of cop cars with lights blinking and sirens
       blaring screech into parking lot, MOM pushes her way
       up in line and greets startled kids who recognize
       her.

                            MOM
                  Hi! I know your mom...

                            KID A
                  It's her!

                            KID B
                  Who?

                            MOM
                  Excuse me.
                   (Pushing her way up in line)
                  Age before beauty...

                            KID C
                  The murder lady!  The one
                  on TV!

                            KID B
                  Cool!  Is she in a band?

                            MOM
                       (Butting ahead)
                  Sorry...the police are after
                  me...

                            DOORMAN
                       (Recognizing her)
                  Hey, you're Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                       (Modestly)
                  I guess I am.

                            DOORMAN
                   (Looks up and sees her family
                    and COPS rushing towards her)

                  Welcome to Hammerjacks,
                  "Serial Mom"!

                            MOM
                  Thank you so much, you kind,
                  kind creature.

155.   INTERIOR HAMMERJACKS.

       A parents' nightmare.  Grunge-punk hell.  "CAMEL
       LIPS" is undulating suggestively on stage screeching
       out the chorus of "Gas Chamber" as they mock gasp
       for breath, dodge beer bottles thrown from audience
       and punch out male groupies who rush the stage past
       brutish bouncers.

       SCOTTY pushes his way through slam dancing crowd as
       he is picked up and bodily tossed through the air by
       frenzied mob of "body-surfing" dancers.

       MOM is racing to catch up with SCOTTY.

                            MOM
                  Excuse me...coming through...
                     (Snatches beer bottle
                      out of boy's hand)
                  Bill Flowers!  You're underage!

                            BILL
                       (Laughing)
                  Don't kill me, Serial Mom!

                            MOM
                    (Snatching joint out of
                     hophead girl's lips)
                  Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR
                  HAIR, young lady!

                            GIRL
                       (Stoned)
                  Wow!  It's her!
                       (Proudly)
                  AND SHE'S A HEAVY METAL
                  MANIAC!!!

       DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way
       through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over
       and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening
       up a crowd for DAD.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY
       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

                            MOM
                       (Hissing)
                  Buckle up, Scotty!

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the
       act.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in
       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,
       mimicking that the music is much too loud.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both
       sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.

       DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as
       they hang their heads in sorrow.

       "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks
       boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she
       smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.

       Female criminals are handcuffed and seated around
       MOM on their way to court as MOM leads them in a
       joyous and Disney-esoue rendition of "100 Bottles of
       Beer on the Wall".  MOM sings out with insane
       happiness and glee.

158.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       A "COURT TV" reporter is interviewing trial groupies
       as they wait in line to go through metal detectors
       to attend MOM's trial.

                            COURT TV
                  ...And you, ma'am, how long
                  have you been waiting to get
                  in?

                            LADY A
                    (Beaming at the attention)
                  Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna
                  be worth it!  I know she's guilty!

                            HUSBAND A
                    (Leaning into the shot)
                  We've been to famous trials
                  all over the country!

                            WIFE A
                    (Getting into the act)
                  ..Manson.. .Watergate...
                       (To Lady A)
                  Didn't I see you at Hinkley?

                            LADY A
                       (Proudly)
                  I was there!  My husband
                  thought I was crazy but...
                    (Seeing Sutphin family
                     getting off elevator)
                  LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!!
                  That awful family!

       The hostile crowd starts craning their necks and
       screaming in recognition as if rock stars are making
       their entrance.  DAD is blinded by the press's
       flashbulbs as HERBIE HEBDEN tries to stop CHIP from
       signing autographs as BIRDIE hands out "Stop the
       Violence" handbills.  REPORTER BOYFRIEND gives MISTY
       the signal and she starts crying for his exclusive
       news shots.

159.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Packed with spectators, press and security officers.
       The middle-class jury of seven woman and five men
       take their place in the jury box as Sutphin family
       take their seats in front row behind HERBIE HEBDEN
       at his defense table.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD, the prosecutor, studies evidence
       photos of victim's bodies at the District Attorney's
       table on other side of the courtroom.  He looks up
       in disgust as MOM makes her apple-pie entrance.
       Escorted by two stern-faced police matrons.
       Subtitle appears "10:00am" and fades out.

                            MOM
                     (Happily waving to DAD)
                  Hi, honey!

       DAD smiles back pitifully.

                            MOM
                     (To CHIP, BIRDIE & MISTY)
                  Kids, did you do your homework?

       They give her a weak smile and nod "Yes".

                            JUDGE
                  Quiet in the courtroom! Court
                  is now in session!

                            MOM
                       (To JURY)
                  Hello, jury people.
                  My name's Beverly Sutphin.
                   (To startled woman juror)
                  I like your jacket!

                            JUDGE
                       (Losing patience)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET!
                  You are accused of mass murder!
                  This is a court of law, not
                  a coffee klatch!
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mr. Nazlerod, your opening
                  statement.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Thank you, your honor.
                       (Approaches JURY)
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of the
                  Jury, my name is Timothy
                  Nazlerod...
                       (Smarmily)
                  ...and I hope we can be
                  friends!
                    (JURY stares back
                     impartially)
                  ...I warn you, this is not a
                  pretty case...Beverly Sutphin
                  is a woman evil to the core...
                   (JURY POV shot of innocent-
                    looking MOM staring back
                    at them)
                  ...a rotten apple, if you will...
                    (DAD gulps in sorrow)
                  ...who beyond a reasonable
                  doubt killed five innocent
                  people!!

       SPECTATORS scowl hatefully at MOM.

                            CHIP
                     (Whispering to BIRDIE,
                      making excuses)
                  Well...they sort of deserved it...

       BIRDIE pales over the mere thought of violence.

                            DAD
                       (To CHIP)
                  Shhhhh!

       He looks over and sees MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND
       are holding hands and glares at them to stop.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED
                  THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR...
                  A FIRE POKER...

       MOM subtly motions to MALE JUROR that he has
       something in his nose.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...

       JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in
       embarrassment.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!

       MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still
       there.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN
                  AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF
                  LAMB!!

       JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him
       that the problem is solved.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is not a
                  woman!...

       MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer
       together to snuggle.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...SHE IS A MONSTER!!

       MOM's smile turns to horror as JUROR #8 on end of
       second row crosses her legs and MOM zeros in on her
       hideous white summer shoes.

       Wipe to a disheveled HERBIE HEBDEN, the ultimate
       liberal defense attorney, as he paces back and forth
       before JURY wiping his brow.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm
                  Herbie Hebden and you and I
                  have a tough job ahead of us...

       MOM is still staring insanely at JUROR1s shoes.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...I have known the Sutphin
                  family for sixteen years...

       MOM is frantically scribbling a note to her attorney
       on a legal pad.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...

       DAD self-consciously smiles to JURORS.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...Chip and Misty played with
                  my own children...

       CHIP smiles to MOM's few heavymetal supporters as
       REPORTER BOYFRIEND puts his arm around MISTY.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...but I've found out I don't
                  know Beverly Sutphin at all!

       He is trying to ignore MOM as she passes him a note
       that says "Juror #8 is wearing white summer shoes!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...No one really knows Beverly
                  Sutphin...

       MOM writes angrily "AFTER LABOR DAY!!"

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  ...You see...
                    (He reads note to humor MOM)
                  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly defiant)
                  I AM NOT!

       Courtroom spectators gasp as DAD's mouth falls open.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                     (Trying to make his point)
                  Yes, she committed these
                  terrible crimes...
                       (Pleading)
                  ...but that doesn't make her
                  a bad person.

                            MOM
                       (Standing)
                  Your honor, I have a motion.
                  I would like to fire my
                  attorney, and defend myself!

       Sutphin family looks at one another, shocked at
       MOM's change of plans.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                  Beverly Sutphin is not guilty,
                  by reason of INSANITY!

                            MOM
                  Oh shut up, Herbie!
                       (To JUDGE)
                  I have the right to defend myself,
                  your honor.  I've read the
                  lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964",
                  and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".

                            JUDGE
                  Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant
                  who has herself for a lawyer
                  has a fool for a client...
                       (To attorneys)
                  Approach the bench!

       MOM smiles at DAD who looks bewildered as CHIP,
       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND give MOM the thumbs-up
       sign as BIRDIE nervously flashes her the peace sign.

                            JUDGE
                     (As bench conference
                      breaks up)
                  Mrs. Sutphin, I have no
                  legal choice but to allow
                  you to take over as your own
                  attorney.

       DAD looks worried and unsure.

                            HERBIE HEBDEN
                   (Sulking out of courtroom,
                    to MOM)
                  You'll get my bill, I mean
                  it!  A big one!

                            JUDGE
                       (To MOM)
                  How do you plead?

                            MOM
                       (Proudly)
                  NOT GUILTY, your honor!

       Courtroom and press buzz intently at MOM's new plea.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Furious)
                  I call to the stand, Dottie
                  Hinkle!

       A vindictive and hostile, DOTTIE HINKLE enters the
       courtroom and eagerly takes the stand.  As she is
       sworn in, MOM watches her with an evil smile.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever
                  receive obscene telephone
                  calls?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Staring right at MOM)
                  I certainly did.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you recognize the voice
                  of the caller?

                            DOTTIE
                  Not at first, but then I
                  heard the same inflection in
                  a voice at a social gathering
                  and I put two and two together.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Who's voice was it, Dottie?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  It was her!  Beverly Sutphin!
                  Sittin' right there!
                    (Dramatically to JURY)
                  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

       Wipe to MOM approaching DOTTIE HINKLE for
       cross-examination.

                            MOM
                  Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Haughtily)
                  No, I don't.

                            MOM
                  So you weren't drunk when
                  you received those alleged
                  obscene phonecalls?

                            DOTTIE
                  I certainly was not!

                            MOM
                  You mean to tell me the
                  day I came over to Mrs.
                  Ackerman's...the day you
                  claim you recognized my
                  voice...you weren't drinking?

                            DOTTIE
                       (Flustered)
                  One beer with lunch is
                  hardly "drinking".

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE smile at MOM's legal skills.

                            MOM
                  So you do drink?

                            DOTTIE
                  Socially...I'll have a
                  beer.

                            MOM
                  So you admit you just
                  lied?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Argumentative!

                            DOTTIE
                       (Rising to the bait)
                  NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

                            JUDGE
                  Sustained.
                       (To DOTTIE)
                  Watch your mouth, Mrs.
                  Hinkle.

       Press scribbles frantically, beginning to doubt
       witness's credibility.

       MOM quickly and sneakily mouths "FUCK YOU" to DOTTIE
       without the JUDGE or anyone else in the courtroom
       besides DOTTIE seeing.

                            DOTTIE
                       (Shocked, to JUDGE)
                  Did you see her?!  She just
                  said "Fuck you" to me!

                             MOM
                        (Innocently, to JUDGE)
                  Let the record show I'm
                  just standing here.

                             DOTTIE
                  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

                             JUDGE
                  I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
                  One more obscenity and I'll
                  charge you with contempt of
                  court.

       DAD watches, amazed at his wife's cunning.

                            MOM
                       (Dramatically)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

                            DOTTIE
                  NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

       Police matrons lunge at DOTTIE as she leaps from
       witness box to attack MOM.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel)
                  Mrs. Hinkle, I find you
                  guilty of contempt of
                  court and sentence you to
                  a thousand dollar fine and
                  five days in jail!
                       (To MATRONS)
                  Lock 'er up!

                            DOTTIE
                    (To MOM, being dragged
                     out)
                  YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY
                  PIG-FUCKER!

       MOM smiles at JURY and turns to wink at her amazed
       family as spectators watch, willing to give MOM, for
       the first time, the benefit of the doubt.

       Fade out.

160.   Fade in to COURTROOM HALLWAY.  MORNING.

       CHIP is pacing up and down yelling into a mobile
       phone outside MOM's trial as long line of spectators
       wait to get in.  Subtitle appears "Tuesday, January
       19th, 10:05am" and then fades out.

                            CHIP
                       (On phone)
                  ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to
                  go to hell!  I don't care what
                  Jeffrey MacDonald's people got
                  - he's old news!  We fly first
                  class or we don't do the show!

       A YOUNG MAN angrily approaches CHIP.
         
                            YOUNG MAN
                  Are you Chip Sutphin?

                            CHIP
                       (Into phone)
                  Hold on...
                       (To YOUNG MAN)
                  Yeah I am, but you'll have
                  to speak to my agent...

                            YOUNG MAN
                  Your mom killed my brother!

       He punches CHIP in the mouth.

                            CHIP
                       (Getting up, rubbing
                        his jaw)
                  That's cool...hey look, you're
                  Carl's brother, right?

                            YOUNG MAN
                  That's right.

                            CHIP
                  I'm sorry he's dead, but...
                  have you signed off yet?

                            YOUNG MAN
                    (Suddenly all business)
                  You mean for TV or print?

                            CHIP
                  TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's
                  interested in playing my
                  mother!

                            YOUNG MAN
                   (Impressed, eyes lighting up)
                  Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna
                  play my brother?  Is Jason
                  Priestly available?

161.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       LU-ANN HODGES, pot-head witness from PTA murder is
       on the stand testifying for the prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Miss Hodges, could you describe
                  the car...the one you saw run
                  over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?

                            LU-ANN
                       (Giggling)
                  I seen that movie!...On cable!

       MOM stares in shock at JUROR #8 who has the nerve to
       give MOM a friendly smile back while wearing yet
       another hideous pair of white summer shoes.  Trying
       to suppress her rage, MOM turns to spectator section
       and happily notices the faces of GUS and SLOPPY
       smiling back to her in support.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                     (Annoyed at his witness)
                  PLEASE, Miss Hodges!

       DAD looks up at the unconvincing witness from
       reading "The Case Against Capital Punishment".

                            LU-ANN
                       (Obviously stoned)
                  'Scuse me...

                  ...Well, like I told you,
                  it was blue.  The car, not
                  the driver...
                       (Laughs like a lunatic)
                  Just blue...you know...like
                  blue!

       DET. BRADFORD is on the witness stand.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...And these books...
                    (Holding up "Urge to Kill",
                     "Mass Murder in Houston")
                  ...these disgusting books that
                  so lovingly describe the sadistic
                  acts of serial killers...Where
                  did you find these books?

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Looking at MOM hatefully)
                  In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Smugly to MOM)
                  You may cross-examine, Mrs.
                  Sutphin.

       MOM takes over and smiles in conspiracy at GUS and
       SLOPPY who giggle in excitement about what is to
       come.

                            MOM
                       (To NAZLEROD)
                  Thank you.
                       (To DET. BRADFORD)
                  Detective Bradford, if I was
                  to look through your trash can,
                  what reading material would I
                  find?

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Objection!  Immaterial!

                            JUDGE
                  You may answer.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                  .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My
                  wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...

                            MOM
                       (Smiling)
                  Well, this magazine was found in
                  your trash just last night...
                       (Holds up porno magazine)
                  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Turning bright red)
                  GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!

       The entire courtroom bursts into laughter except for
       his partner, DET. MOORE, who looks at him in shock.
       GUS and SLOPPY laugh the loudest.

                            MOM
                  Don't judge people by what
                  they read, Detective.
                       (Smugly)
                  Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.

       MOM winks to SLOPPY and GUS.

                            DET BRADFORD
                   (Sputtering, purple with rage)
                  I'm a married man!!

       BAILIFFS forcefully remove him from the stand.

                            DET. BRADFORD
                       (Yelling to MOM)
                  I hope you get the gas chamber!

                            JUDGE
                  The jury is instructed to ignore
                  the outburst of the witness.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                    (Furious at MOM's
                     cross-examination)
                  I call to the stand Rosemary
                  Ackerman!

       Wipe to MRS. ACKERMAN on the stand holding the fire
       poker murder weapon tagged as evidence.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  ...and did you ever see the
                  fire poker again after you
                  left it with Mrs. Sutphin?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes!  Thirty minutes later
                  it was covered with blood and
                  gore and Carl Padgett was dead!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  No further questions.

                            MOM
                   (Standing to cross-examine)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, when you left
                  me at the flea-market, where
                  did you go?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  ...Browsing.

                            MOM
                  Did Carl Padgett buy
                  something you wanted?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  I didn't want that Faberge
                  egg - it was chipped!

                            MOM
                  Carl Padgett died for the
                  Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                    (Shocked at the suspicion
                     being pointed at her)
                  NO!  I could never hurt anyone!

       Spectators buzz.

                            MOM
                       (Not letting up)
                  That was your People magazine
                  with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                  Yes, but I lent it...

                            MOM
                       (Cutting her off)
                  And those were your scissors
                  found sticking out of Mrs.
                  Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                       (Stuttering, panicked)
                  Yes...but...I didn't...

                            MOM
                       (Suddenly, dramatically)
                  Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
         
                            MRS. ACKERMAN
                   (Horrified at the sudden
                    silence in court as everyone
                    stares at her in hostility)
                  No...
                       (Weakly)
                  I don't have room in my kitchen...

       GUS, SLOPPY and all the spectators let out a howl of
       disapproval.  Even the JUDGE scowls at the witness
       in disgust.

164.   EXTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       REPORTER BOYFRIEND is unpacking stack of the
       "instant" book he wrote "Serial Mom - The Real

                            HOUSEWIFE A
                       (To RALPH)
                  Could you sign it: "To

                  I have reasonable doubt.

                            HOUSEWIFE C

       MRS. ACKERMAN as she runs in terror from courthouse
       with GUS and SLOPPY chasing after her.

165.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE.

       DET. MOORE is on witness stand being examined by the
       prosecution.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Detective Moore, did you
                  then proceed to the stage
                  area inside "Hammerjacks"?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil
                  was on fire and he fell to
                  his knees in flames.

       BIRDIE looks up from reading "Ghandi" biography and
       gags as prosecutor hands DET. MOORE a gory 8x10
       glossy photo of victim.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Would this be what you saw?

                            DET. MOORE
                  Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.

       Suddenly a buzz starts in the courtroom and all
       heads turn to the back of the spectator section
       where the real life star, FARRAH FAWCETT* is
       entering with an entourage to "observe" Serial Mom.

       MOM acknowledges MS. FAWCETT with a dignified nod as
       DAD looks on in amazement.

       DET. MOORE, the JURY, even the JUDGE crane their
       necks to get a better look at FARRAH FAWCETT.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Ignoring FARRAH FAWCETT,
                        trying to continue)
                  Your honor!
                       (Impatiently)
                  May the photo be entered in as
                  evidence and passed to the jury?

                            JUDGE
                  Huh?...oh yeah...YES.

                            DET. MOORE
                       (Star-struck)
                  Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah
                  Fawcett!

                            JUDGE
                     (Blurting out, unable
                      to contain himself)
                  I loved you in "The Burning
                  Bed"!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                         (Furious at JUDGE)
                  No further questions!
                         (Smugly looking at MOM)
                  I call to the stand, Marvin
                  Pickles.

       MOM looks back in sudden fear at the prospect of
       this mystery witness.

166.   INTERIOR COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES, the pervert from the flea market
       bathroom has locked himself in a stall and is
       scrawling "I SNIFF JURIES' UNDERPANTS" on wall.

       A POLICE OFFICER enters men's room, frantically
       banging on bathroom doors.

                            COP
                  MR. PICKLES!  MR. MARVIN
                  PICKLES!

                            MARVIN
                  Be right out.

                            COP
                  The Judge is waiting for you!

167.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       MARVIN PICKLES hurriedly enters as all heads turn to
       follow him to the stand.  CHIP, who has joined
       BIRDIE and his family looks at MOM and sees her
       worried expression.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  State your name, please.

                            MARVIN
                  Marvin A. Pickles.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Were you in the men's room
                  at the Edmonson Drive In
                  Flea Market on Saturday,
                  September 19th?

                            MARVIN
                  Yes, I was.

       FARRAH FAWCETT answers a ringing mobile phone in her
       purse.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  Did you see anybody in the
                  booth next to you?

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

                            MARVIN
                  I...um...
                       (Turned on)
                  uh...

       MOM looks at him confused, still unaware of his
       letchery.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Getting testy)
                  Mr. Pickle!  Did you see
                  anybody in the booth next
                  to you?

                            MARVIN
                  I...1'm not sure...
                   (Really turned on,
                    starting to moan)
                  ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Outraged)
                  What do you mean, you're not
                  sure?!

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.

                            MARVIN
                   (Eyes popping out of head)
                  There was nobody next to me:

       Housewife trial groupies start buzzing wildly in
       newfound support of MOM.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Losing it)
                  Mr. Pickles, you testified
                  before the Grand Jury that
                  you looked down and "saw a
                  pair of lady's shoes" in the
                  stall next to you.

       MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins
       flapping her leqe back and forth under the table,
       flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom.

                            MARVIN
                       (Lost in his own
                        perverted glory)
                  Ohhhh!  I just said what you
                  told me to!

       DAD looks over at MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND who
       have rejoined the family in court and is horrified
       to see them with their arms wrapped around each
       other, cuddling.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                  PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE,
                  MR. PICKLES!!

       MOM is flapping her legs back and forth double time
       as MARVIN goes into his own private orgasm.

                            MARVZN
                  Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up!
                  I never saw Beverly Sutphin
                  in my life!

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Absolutely furious)
                  You'll pay for this, Marvin
                  A. Pickles!
                       (Returning to seat)
                  I'm turning your file over
                  to the vice-squad!!
                       (Sitting down)
                  The prosecution rests, your
                  honor.

                            MOM
                   (Giving MARVIN her version of
                    a sexy smile as he leaves stand)
                  The prosecution has proven
                  nothing, your honor.
                       (To the JURY)
                  The defense also rests!

       The spectators burst into spontaneous applause as
       DAD looks at the kids in fear at the upcoming
       verdict.

168.   Wipe to HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAM FAWCETT is giving an impromptu press
       conference to the throng of adoring reporters.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin
                  is an innocent woman, wrongly
                  accused.  A normal housewife
                  trapped in a nightmare of
                  circumstantial evidence...

169.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       TIMOTHY NAZLEROD is giving the prosecution's closing
       argument.

                            MR. NAZLEROD
                       (Pointing to MOM)
                  ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee
                  Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A
                  new face in the deck of serial
                  killer trading cards... Find
                  her guilty of all five counts
                  of first degree murder...!

170.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is still pontificating for the press.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                  ...I only hope that I can
                  portray "Serial Mom"'s life on
                  the TV screen with the proper
                  dignity that this feminist
                  heroine deserves.

171.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

                            MOM
                   (Addressing the jury with
                    calm believability)
                  Look at me!  I'm a normal
                  person just like you are!

       DAD wipes away a tear as CHIP looks at a preliminary
       design for mini-series showing FARRAH FAWCETT done
       up as MOM.

                            MOM
                  ...But I've been framed by
                  the police...

       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND are now openly making
       out in courtroom.

                            MOM
                  ...and perjured against by
                  the very people I thought
                  were my friends...

       BIRDIE looks out of courtroom window and sees a bird
       eating a worm and shudders in horror as CHIP pats
       her hand affectionately.

                            MOM
                  ...All I ask is that you
                  have the courage to find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

172.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM.

       FARRAH FAWCETT is "reenacting" MOM's closing
       argument for the enthralled press corp.

                            FARRAH FAWCETT
                       (Hammily)
                  ...All I ask is that you find
                  me innocent of these terribly
                  untrue charges...

173.   INTERIOR COURTROOM.

       Dissolve to stern-faced JURORS filing back into jury
       box, not looking at MOM.  Subtitle appears "Two days
       later.  Thursday, January 21st.  3:20pm" and then
       fades out.

                            JUDGE
                  Ladies and Gentlemen of
                  the Jury, have you reached
                  a verdict?

                            FOREMAN
                  Yes we have, your honor...

       JUROR #8 gives MOM a smile.

                            FOREMAN
                  ...We find the defendant
                  not guilty of all charges.

       Courtroom erupts in pandemonium, FARRAH FAWCETT
       cheering the loudest.  MOM turns to family who sit
       stunned in seats.

                            MOM
                  I'm coming home!!

       DAD forces a weak smile as he turns white as a
       ghost.

                            JUDGE
                       (Bangs gavel in disgust)
                  Court adjourned!

                            DAD
                    (Whispering to a shocked
                     CHIP and MISTY)
                  ...What should I do?

                            CHIP
                       (Suddenly nervous)
                  Bring her home...I guess.

                            BIRDIE
                       (Mumbling to herself)
                  No more violence...No more
                  violence...

                            REPORTER BOYFRIEND
                  Think she'll like me?

                            MISTY
                       (Worried)
                  Just be nice to her.  And try
                  ...just try not to get on her
                  nerves.

       MOM rushes over to DAD, free at last and gives him a
       big hug as press, fans, even the jury cheer her
       victory.

174.   INTERIOR COURTROOM HALLWAY.

       The stunned Sutphin family exits as MOM raises fists
       like "Rocky" to cheers of her supporters.

                            MOM
                    (Graciously accepting
                     flowers, signing autographs,
                     posing for the press)
                  I love you!  Thanks for coming!
                     (Slows a kiss to newsteam)
                  Hi Los Angeles!
                     (Looking into another camera)
                  Hello Cleveland!
                     (And another)
                  And you too, New York!

       Down the hall, inside a bank of old fashioned wooden
       phone booths is JUROR #8, excitedly talking on pay
       phone.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Proudly)
                  We did it!  We set her free!
                  I knew she was innocent
                  right from the beginning!...

       Without warning, MOM slams her way into phone booth,
       hangs up the call and grabs receiver out of JUROR
       #8's hand.

                            MOM
                       (Snarling scarily)
                  You can't wear white shoes
                  after Labor Day!

                            JUROR #8
                       (Stammering in open-mouthed
                        terror)
                  No...please...that's not
                  true anymore.

                            MOM
                  Oh yes it is!
                       (In homicidal fury)
                  Didn't your mother ever
                  tell you?!

       MOM suddenly bludgeons JUROR #8 over the head with
       the telephone receiver.

                            MOM
                  Well, now you know!

       JUROR #8, stunned by the blow, struggles to stay
       conscious.

                            JUROR #8
                       (Staggering in pain)
                  But...fashion has changed...

                            MOM
                       (Enraged)
                  No it hasn't!

       MOM imediately hits JUROR #8 over the head again
       with the telephone receiver.

       As JUROR #8's screams are drowned out by the passing
       PRESS MOB, MOM hits her again and again with the
       telephone receiver until JUROR #8 collapses to the
       ground, her white summer shoes turned red with her
       own blood.

       Cut back to Sutphin family, holding on to each other
       for dear life as the mob of supporters swell around
       them.

                            DAD
                     (Realizing MOM is missing
                      in the confusion)
                  Beverly?  Beverly?

       MOM flies out of phone booth wearing a big smile,
       not missing a beat.

                            MOM
                  Right here, honey.

                            PRESS
                  Mrs. Sutphin, can we get
                  a shot with you and Farrah
                  Fawcett?

                            MOM
                  Certainly.

       FARRAH FAWCETT barges in and takes over.

                            FARRAH
                  Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah
                  Fawcett
                      (Pulling MOM rudely)
                  You stand here...
                      (To PRESS)
                  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...

                            MOM
                   (Trying to get on other
                    side of FAWCETT)
                  ...but please...if I could
                  just...

                            FARRAH
                    (Rudely shoving MOM back
                     in place)
                  Stay there, Beverly.
                       (Posing)
                  Smile, Serial Mom!

       Flashbulbs explode.

                            MOM
                   (Hissing to FARRAH in the
                    scariest, most threatening
                    voice yet)
                  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH
                  FAWCETT!!

       A JUROR down the hall screams in horror as she opens
       phone booth door and a bloody white shoe pops out.

       FARRAH FAWCETT looks back at MOM in sudden fear.

       MOM glares back with the face of a madwoman.

       Freeze frame.

       Dissolve to epilogue title card:  "Beverly Sutphin
       is a free woman."

            Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's

            here.

                         WENDY

            like you to take him around the
            place as soon as we are through.

                         WATSON
            Fine.

            What line of work are you in now?

                         JACK
            I'm a writer um... Teaching has
            been more or less a way of making
            ends meet.

            Well, I'm looking for a change.

                         ULLMAN (OFF)
            Our people in Denver recommended
            Jack very highly, and, for once, I
            agree with them.

                         ULLMAN
            Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I
            was about to explain that eh... our
            season here runs from oh May 15th
            to October 30th and then we close
            down completely until the following
            May.

            Do you mind if I ask why you do
            that?  It seems to me that the
            skiing up here would be fantastic.

                         ULLMAN (OFF)
            Oh, it sure would be

M.S. ULLMAN

                         ULLMAN (CONT'D)
            but the problem is the enormous
            cost it would be to keep the road
            to the Sidewinder open.  It's a...
            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
            gets an average of 20 feet of snow
            during the winter, and there's just
            no way to make it economically
            feasible to keep it clear.  When
            the place was built in 1907, there
            was very little interest in winter
            sports, and this site was chosen
            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

                         JACK
            Well, it's certainly got plenty of
            that.

JACK laughs.

                         ULLMAN
            That's right.  And did they give
            you any idea in Denver about what
            the job entails?

                                                            8.


                         JACK
            Only in a very general way.

                         ULLMAN
            Well...

            ...the winters can be fantastically
            cruel, and the basic idea is
            to...to cope with the very costly
            damage and depreciation which can
            occur.  And this consists mainly of
            running the boiler, heating
            different parts of the hotel on a
            daily rotating basis, repairing
            damage as it occurs and doing
            repairs, so that the elements can't
            get a foothold.

            Physically, it's not a very
            demanding job.  The only thing that
            can get a bit trying up here during
            the winter is eh... the tremendous
            sense of isolation.

            hired a man named Charles Grady, as
            the winter caretaker.  He came up
            here with his wife and two little
            girls of about eight or ten.  And
            he had a good employment record,
            good references and from what I've
            been told, I mean, he seemed like a
            completely normal individual.  But
            at some point during the winter, he
            must have suffered some kind of a
            complete mental breakdown.

            Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you
            have anything to worry about.  I'm
            quite sure there is nothing
            physically wrong with Danny.

            Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems
            absolutely fine now, but you should
            have seen him.

                         DOCTOR
            Oh I know.  Kids can scare you to
            death, but believe me these episodes
            are not at all uncommon, and they
            look much worse than they are.

                         DOCTOR
            Mrs. Torrance, most of the time
            these episodes with kids are never
            explained.  They are brought on by
            emotional factors, and they rarely
            occur again.

                         DOCTOR
            They're more akin to auto-hypnosis,
            a kind of self induced trance.  If
            it re-occurs which I doubt

            No.  He didn't like it too much at
            first, and then he had an injury,
            so we kept him out for a while,
            and, yeah, I...I guess that's about
            the time when I first noticed that
            he was talking to Tony.

            Well it's just one of those things.
            You know... purely an accident, um.
            My husband had oh... been drinking,
            and he came home about three hours
            late, so he wasn't exactly in the
            greatest mood that night.  And well
            Danny had scattered some of his
            school papers all over the room...
            and my husband grabbed his arm, you
            know, and pulled him away from them.
            It's...it's just the sort of thing
            you do a hundred times with a
            child - you know, in a park or on
            the streets - but on this particular
            occasion my husband just... used
            too much strength and he injured
            Danny's arm.

            Yes.

            Well the place is very nicely self-

JACK feels bed.

                         ULLMAN (OFF)
            Yes, very cosy for a family, and if
            you feel like spreading out you
            have the rest of the hotel to move
            around in.

                         JACK
            Well, it's very... homely.

                         ULLMAN
            This is our famous hedge maze.
            It's quite an attraction around
            here.  The walls are thirteen feet
            high and the hedges are about as
            old as the hotel itself.  It's a
            lot of fun,

They walk from end of Maze towards Hotel in b.g.

                         ULLMAN (CONT'D)

            had an hour to spare to find my way
            out.

Hotel - CAMERA TRACKS with them.

                         ULLMAN
            Ah... construction started in 1907.
            It was finished in 1909.  The site
            is supposed to be located on an
            Indian burial ground, and I believe
            they actually had to repel a few
            Indian attacks as they were building
            it.

ULLMAN points to red Snowcat at entrance of garage.

                         ULLMAN
            That's our Snowcat.  Can you both
            drive a car?

                         JACK & WENDY
                   (together)
            Yes.

They walk towards SNOWCAT.

                         ULLMAN
            That's fine because basically the
            Snowcat operates very much like a
            car and it won't take you long to
            get the hang of it.

            brought a decorator in from Chicago
            just last year to refurbish this
            part of the hotel.

                         WENDY

            I'm afraid you're not going to do
            too well here unless you've brought
            your own supplies.  We always
            remove all the booze from the
            premises when we shut down:

            Dick, if you're ready to do it now,

            you could show Mrs. Torrance the

            I did?

            Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes,
            you know, like in the Bugs Bunny
            cartoons.  But how did you know that?

                         HALLORAN
            Well I guess I probably heard you
            call him that.

            Well, it's possible, but I honestly

            Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance
            for a few minutes?  We're on our
            way through to the basement - I
            promise we won't keep her very long.

                         HALLORAN
            No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just
            getting to the ice cream.

HALLORAN laughs.

            You folks don't mind if I give

            Not at all.

                         WENDY
            No, we don't mind.

            It's just that you know some places

            some don't.  I guess you could say
            the Overlook Hotel here has
            something about it that's like
            shining.

            Well, you know Doc, when something

            things that haven't happened yet.
            Well, sometimes they can see things
            that happened a long time ago... I
            think a lot of things happened

            late.

                         JACK
            I know it.

JACK sticks his tongue out.  WENDY picks up plate and glass
of orange juice.

                         WENDY
            I made 'em just the way you like
            'em, sunny side up.

                         JACK
            Hmm, nice.

WENDY walks forward to JACK and puts plate down cam.L.  She
hands him glass of orange juice and he drinks it.

                         WENDY
            It's really pretty outside.  How
            about taking me for a walk after
            you've finished your breakfast?

                         JACK
            Oh I suppose I oughta try to do
            some writing first.

He puts empty glass down cam.L and picks up plate of eggs
and bacon.

                         WENDY
            Any ideas yet?

                         JACK
            Lots of ideas.  No good ones.

WENDY sits down cam.R.

                         WENDY
            Well, something'll come.  It's just
            a matter of settling back into the
            habit of writing every day.

                         JACK
            Yeah... that's all it is.

JACK starts to eat bacon.

                         WENDY
            It's really nice up here, isn't it?

                         JACK

            never been this happy, or
            comfortable anywhere.

                         JACK
            I fell in love with it right away.
            When I came up here from my
            interview, it was as though I had
            been here before.  We...we all have
            moments of deja vu, but this was
            ridiculous.  It was almost as
            though I knew what was going to be
            around every corner.  Ooohhhhh...

            you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a

            I did hurt him once, okay?  It was
            an accident, complete unintentional.
            It could have happened to anybody.

He raps on counter with hand.

            And it was three goddam years ago.
            The little fucker had thrown all my
            papers all over the floor.  All I
            tried to do was to pull him up.  A
            momentary loss of muscular
            coordination.  I mean... A few

            Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker
            here.  I recognize you.  I saw your
            picture in the newspapers.  You
            eh... chopped your wife and
            daughters up into little bits, and
            eh... and you blew your brains out.

            cost it would be to keep the road
            to the Sidewinder open.  It's a...
            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
            gets an average of 20 feet of snow
            during the winter, and there's just
            no way to make it economically
            feasible to keep it clear.  When
            the place was built in 1907, there
            was very little interest in winter
            sports, and this site was chosen
            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

            cruel, and the basic idea is
            to...to cope with the very costly
            damage and depreciation which can
            occur.  And this consists mainly of
            running the boiler, heating
            different parts of the hotel on a
            daily rotating basis, repairing
            damage as it occurs and doing
            repairs, so that the elements can't

            Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and
            I still have an awful lot to go
            through.  I don't think I can get
            home before nine or ten.

                         DOCTOR
            Now I'm going to ask you to do me a
            favor, and stay quietly in bed for
            the rest of the day.  Okay?

                         DANNY
            Do I have to?

                         DOCTOR
            Yes, I'd like you to.

                         WENDY
            We're just going to go into one of
            the other rooms for a few minutes
            and talk - then I'll come back and
            check on you, okay?

            Okay.

            Thank you.

DOCTOR moves to sofa and sits down - WENDY sits in chair

                         DOCTOR
            Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you
            have anything to worry about.  I'm
            quite sure there is nothing
            physically wrong with Danny.

            Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems
            absolutely fine now, but you should
            have seen him.

M.S. DOCTOR over WENDY.  DOCTOR leans back on sofa.

                         DOCTOR
            Oh I know.  Kids can scare you to
            death, but believe me these episodes
            are not at all uncommon, and they
            look much worse than they are.

                                            CUT TO:

M.S. WENDY over DOCTOR.

                         WENDY
            But eh what was the matter with him?

                         DOCTOR
            Mrs. Torrance, most of the time
            these episodes with kids are never
            explained.  They are brought on by
            emotional factors, and they rarely
            occur again.

                                            CUT TO:

M.S. DOCTOR.

                         DOCTOR
            They're more akin to auto-hypnosis,
            a kind of self induced trance.  If
            it re-occurs which I doubt

                                            CUT TO:

M.S. WENDY takes cigarette out of packet.

                         DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)
            you can always think about having
            some tests done.

WENDY holds cigarette packet out towards DOCTOR.

                         DOCTOR (OFF)
            No thank you.

She puts packet down on table.

                         WENDY
            Oh, I'm...I'm sure you're right.

She lights cigarette from lighter.

            Tony.

                         DOCTOR
            Did Tony's first appearance happen
            to coincide with your arrival here?

                         WENDY
            No, um let's see I guess Danny
            started talkin to Tony about the
            time we put him into nursery school.

                         DOCTOR
            Did he adjust well to school?

M.C.S. WENDY - she shakes her head.

                         WENDY
            No.  He didn't like it too much at
            first, and then he had an injury,
            so we kept him out for a while,
            and, yeah, I...I guess that's about
            the time when I first noticed that
            he was talking to Tony.

                                            CUT TO:

M.S. DOCTOR over WENDY.

                         DOCTOR
            What sort of injury did he have?

                                            CUT TO:

M.C.S. WENDY

                         WENDY
            Ah he dislocated his shoulder.

WENDY inhales.

                                                           22.


                         DOCTOR (OFF)
            How did he manage to do that?

                         WENDY
            Well it's just one of those things.
            You know... purely an accident, um.
            My husband had oh... been drinking,
            and he came home about three hours
            late, so he wasn't exactly in the
            greatest mood that night.  And well
            Danny had scattered some of his
            school papers all over the room...
            and my husband grabbed his arm, you
            know, and pulled him away from them.
            It's...it's just the sort of thing
            you do a hundred times with a
            child - you know, in a park or on
            the streets - but on this particular
            occasion my husband just... used

            snowbound one winter in the

            It was finished in 1909.  The site
            is supposed to be located on an
            Indian burial ground, and I believe

            The Torrances are going to take
            care of the Overlook for us this
            winter.

                         HALLORAN
            Oh, that's just great.  How do you
            folks like our hotel so far?

                         WENDY
            Oh it's just wonderful.

WENDY waves out cam.L.

            of bombing the universe?

                         DANNY

                         ULLMAN
            Dick, if you're ready to do it now,
            I think it would be a good idea if
            you could show Mrs. Torrance the
            kitchen, while I continue on with
            Jack.

                         HALLORAN
            It will be a pleasure.  Right this
            way Mrs. Torrance.

                         WENDY
            Great.  See you later, hon.

HALLORAN walks away to b.g.  WENDY & DANNY follow him.

            Mrs. Torrance, your husband
            introduced you as Winifred.  Now
            are you a Winnie or a Freddie?

                         WENDY
            I'm a Wendy.

                         HALLORAN
            Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the
            prettiest.

                         WENDY
            God.  This is the kitchen, huh?

                         HALLORAN
            Yeah, this is it.  How do you like
            it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?

                         DANNY
            Yeah, it's the biggest place I've
            ever seen.

HALLORAN laughs.

                                                           34.


                         WENDY
            Yeah.  This whole place is such an
            enormous maze, I feel I'll have to
            leave a trail of breadcrumbs every
            time I come in.

HALLORAN laughs.

                         HALLORAN
            Don't let it get you down Mrs.
            Torrance - it's big but it still
            ain't nothing but a kitchen... a
            lot of the stuff you'll never have
            to touch.

                         WENDY
            I wouldn't know what to do with it
            if I did.

                         HALLORAN
            Well one thing for sure, you don't
            have to worry about food because
            you folks could eat up here a whole
            year and never have the same menu
            twice.

HALLORAN points to cam.L and leans to cam.L taking hold of

            roasts - thirty ten pound bags of
            hamburgers.  You got twelve-
            turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and
            twenty legs of lamb.
                   (to Danny)
            Do you like lamb, Doc?

                         DANNY
            No.

                                                           35.


                         HALLORAN
            You don't?  Well what's your
            favorite food then?

                         DANNY
            French Fries and Ketchup.

HALLORAN laughs.

                         HALLORAN
            Well I think we can manage that
            too, Doc.  Come along now.  Watch

HALLORAN closes the door and turns to WENDY.

                         WENDY (CONT'D)
            how did you know we called him 'Doc'?

HALLORAN, DANNY & WENDY walk forward - CAMERA TRACKS BACK

                         HALLORAN
            Beg pardon?

                         WENDY
            Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice
            just now.

                         HALLORAN
            I did?

                         WENDY
            Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes,
            you know, like in the Bugs Bunny
            cartoons.  But how did you know that?

                         HALLORAN
            Well I guess I probably heard you
            call him that.

                                                           36.


                         WENDY
            Well, it's possible, but I honestly
            don't remember calling him that
            since we've been with you.

They all stop walking.

                         HALLORAN
            Well anyway, he looks like a Doc,
            doesn't he?

HALLORAN bends down to DANNY.

                         HALLORAN
                   (clicks his tongue)
            Me ah - what's up, Doc?

HALLORAN laughs and turns away to door cam.L.  He opens door.

            way through to the basement - I
            promise we won't keep her very long.

                         HALLORAN
            No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just
            getting to the ice cream.

HALLORAN leans down to DANNY.

HALLORAN straightens up and looks at JACK.

            You folks don't mind if I give

            Not at all.

            No, I'm scared of nothing here.
            It's just that you know some places
            are like people, some shine and
            some don't.  I guess you could say
            the Overlook Hotel here has
            something about it that's like
            shining.

                         DANNY
            Is there something bad here?

                         HALLORAN
            Well, you know Doc, when something
            happens it can leave a trace of
            itself behind... say like is
            someone burns toast.

            Not things that anyone can notice,

            can see.  Just like they can see
            things that haven't happened yet.
            Well, sometimes they can see things
            that happened a long time ago... I
            think a lot of things happened
            right here in this particular
            hotel - over the years, and not all

            to have two twenties and two tens
            right here in my wallet.  I was
            afraid they were going to be there
            until next April.  So here's what:
            you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a
            glass and some ice.  You can do
            that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not

GRADY mops JACK's jacket with his serviette.

                         GRADY
            I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It
            tends to stain.

            Advocaat is it?

            That doesn't matter, sir.  You're
            the important one.

                         JACK
            Awfully nice of you to say.  Of
            course I intend to change my jacket
            this evening before the fish and

            right now at the Eisenhower Tunnel.
            I guess as we've just heard from
            the news forecast, Charlie, a few
            of the flights are still landing
            out at Stapleton International
            Airport, and, with these early
            storms like this, I guess the
            entire airport will probably be
            closed within the hour.  Yeah,
            they're just not prepared.  The
            storm will continue throughout the
            day, and the national weather
            service... has declared a stopmans

            areas outlying the Denver metro
            region - get the cows in the barn.

               EXT. STARLINER TOWERS APARTMENT COMPLEX -- MORNING

               Starliner Towers is seen in LS through the windshield of a 
               moving car. The car approaches the complex and stops near 
               the main doors of the West Tower.

               Out of the car climb Kresimir and Benda Sviben, a gawky newly 
               wed young couple. Kresimir elaborately opens the door for 
               Benda, his new wife, and they walk with hands intertwined up 
               the steps of the West Tower.

               INT. LOBBY -- MORNING

               As the Svibens approach the main doors, the doorman leaps up 
               from his chair beside the intercom switchboard and opens the 
               door for them. The doorman, like most security guards, does 
               not look capable of handling a serious crisis. He is about 
               fifty, of average height but slightly built, wears thick 
               glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his 
               hip.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Morning, folks. Can I help you?

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Yes, please. I... er, we... are 
                         looking for the rental agent here. 
                         We have an appointment.

                                     DOORMAN
                         OK, I'll just give him a little buzz 
                         and he'll come out and show you the 
                         way in.

               The doorman presses a button on the intercom board. As he 
               turns back to the Svibens, he catches his holster on the 
               board.

                                     DOORMAN
                              (freeing holster)
                         Darned thing.

                                     BENDA
                         Do you ever use that?

                                     DOORMAN
                         This? No, never even had it out of 
                         the holster. A rival company has 
                         'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an 
                         advertising gimmick.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Dr. Emil Hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling 
               Annabelle Horsefield. Despite the difference in their sizes -- 
               Annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen -- Hobbes is 
               not having an easy time of it. Hobbes is wearing overlarge 
               blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; Annabelle is in a private 
               girls' school outfit -- white blouse, dark blue tie, blue 
               knee socks, pleated gray skirt.

               Annabelle fights back fiercely; Hobbes has tears in his eyes. 
               The struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, 
               although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their 
               way to cause a lot of crashing around. At one point Annabelle 
               breaks loose and Hobbes has to chase her.

               Annabelle slips and Hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, 
               where he has the advantage of leverage. He strangles her 
               quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. Blood oozes from 
               her mouth. Hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though 
               trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something 
               from leaving her body.

               He reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled 
               some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, 
               and clamps Annabelle's lips together. He then picks up her 
               body, carries it over to the dining-room table and sweeps 
               the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. He then 
               places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins 
               to undress it.

               INT. LOBBY -- MORNING

               The doorman leaves the Svibens to open the door for the 
               Spergazzis, an elderly Italian couple who both use aluminum, 
               four-pronged canes to help them walk. The Svibens watch the 
               old couple as they enter and then glance at each other 
               significantly -- 'We'll be together when we're as old as 
               they are.'

               Mr. Spergazzi tips his hat to the doorman, who opens the 
               inner door for him.

               As the Spergazzis make their way shakily toward the elevators, 
               Mr. Merrick, the rental agent, appears from around a corner. 
               He is slick, mustachioed, and wears a wide paisley tie. He 
               extends his hand for a handshake even though he is still 
               fifty feet from the inner doors. The doorman keeps the door 
               open for him.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Here's Mr. Merrick. He'll take you 
                         on in.

                                     MERRICK
                              (ingratiatingly)
                         Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you 
                         are...?

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Kresimir and Benda Sviben.

                                     MERRICK
                         Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs. 
                         Sweden. Come right this way. Sorry 
                         to keep you waiting. Now, are we 
                         talking about one or two bedrooms? I 
                         assume we're not talking about 
                         bachelors, eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have 
                         several floor plans all laid out for 
                         you, and all you have to do is take 
                         your choice and we'll trot right on 
                         up there and take a look at 'em...

               The three disappear around a corner.

               The doorman pulls a Harlequin Nurse Romance out of his jacket 
               and sits down to continue reading it.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose, 
               snaps on rubber gloves.

               He turns to Annabelle's corpse on the dining-room table, 
               legs hanging over the edge, now naked -- the private girls' 
               school clothes in a heap on the floor. Hobbes takes a scalpel 
               from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his 
               surgical instruments. He feels Annabelle's stomach until he 
               has found what he wants, then cuts her open with one smooth, 
               confident stroke of the scalpel.

               He then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some 
               clear fluid in a squeeze bottle, lights a wooden match, and 
               drops it into her abdominal cavity. The corpse bursts into 
               flame.

               Hobbes steps back to watch. Tears spring into his eyes. He 
               picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into 
               his neck. Blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to 
               the other side. Hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing 
               corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons 
               of his neck.

               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- MORNING

               Merrick and the Svibens sit across from each other at a long 
               table strewn with floor plans and maps. The river which 
               surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass walls of 
               the office. Merrick taps one plan with his finger and slides 
               it over to Benda.

                                     MERRICK
                         Now you take a look at that one, 
                         Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't 
                         suit you down to the ground. That 
                         one has the big view, the panoramic 
                         view...

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               In his bathroom, Nicholas Tudor is cleaning his teeth with 
               microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed-
               water device called a water-pick. Tudor is thirty-nine, not 
               happy with his work as an insurance appraiser, and has 
               recently adopted a general air of terse, sullen desperation 
               as his primary mood.

               His wife, Janine, calls to him from the kitchen, where she 
               is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast.

                                     JANINE (V.O.)
                         Breakfast is just about ready, Nick.

               Tudor pointedly doesn't answer, but continues with the water-
               pick until he is completely satisfied. He carefully packs 
               the machine away, then leaves the bathroom.

               In the dining room, Janine is putting breakfast on the table. 
               Tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat. Janine 
               returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee 
               in each hand. She puts one cup in front of Tudor, sits down, 
               starts to drink the other one. After a pause, she speaks.

                                     JANINE
                         Can I call you at the office?

                                     TUDOR
                         What do you want to call me at the 
                         office for?

                                     JANINE
                         I don't know. I just thought I might 
                         want to call you. I don't know.

                                     TUDOR
                         I won't be at the office except to 
                         sign in.
                              (he eats heartily, 
                              not looking directly 
                              at Janine)
                         I've got a lot of claims to check 
                         out. All over the place. Garages and 
                         more garages.
                              (noticing Janine's 
                              silence, he finally 
                              looks up)
                         I'll come home right after work.

               Janine continues to toy with the food in her plate. She shrugs 
               once, as if to say, 'Big deal, so what?' Tudor ignores her 
               and finishes breakfast.

               INT. A HALLWAY -- MORNING

               Tudor leaves his apartment, closing the door behind him (we 
               see the number clearly).

               He walks down the hallway on automatic pilot, obviously 
               preoccupied, turning the corner leading to the elevators 
               without perceiving what he is seeing.

               At the elevators he hesitates for a moment, then presses the 
               UP button. When the door opens, he steps in.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- MORNING

               In the elevator are Merrick, the rental agent, and the 
               Svibens.

                                     MERRICK
                         We're going up.

                                     TUDOR
                         Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride.

                                     MERRICK
                              (after a pause, to 
                              the Svibens, 
                              indicating the 
                              elevator)
                         Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent, 
                         fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. 
                         Everything you could want in an 
                         elevator.

               Nobody says another word until the doors spring open and 
               Merrick, after a wink at Tudor, hustles the Svibens out of 
               the elevator.

               As the doors close, Merrick's voice floats back to Tudor.

                                     MERRICK (V.O.)
                         Notice how the entranceways to all 
                         the apartments are recessed and 
                         individually lit... Nope, it's down 
                         that way, Brenda. That's it... 
                         Recessed and individually lit...

               Once the door has closed, Tudor presses the button for the 
               top floor. As the elevator ascends, he takes out his wallet 
               and removes a key from a zippered compartment.

               INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING

               Tudor fits the key into the lock of Annabelle's apartment. 
               He knocks gently and then opens the door. After a pause he 
               steps in and closes the door behind him, not wanting to be 
               seen by anyone who might know him.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               As soon as he is inside the apartment, Tudor knows that 
               something is seriously wrong. Smoke hangs in the air and the 
               smell of burned flesh attacks Tudor's nostrils. He is on his 
               way to the bedroom when he sees Hobbes's foot around the 
               corner of the dining room.

               Tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his nose 
               and mouth.

               Annabelle's corpse is still smoking where it lies on the 
               dining-room table. Hobbes's body is twisted into the fetal 
               position at the foot of the table, one hand still clutching 
               the scalpel stuck in its neck, the floor beneath it bright 
               with blood.

               Tudor winces as though stuck with a pin. Blinking rapidly, 
               he edges around the room until his angle of vision is such 
               that he can see the head of the corpse on the table. It is 
               definitely Annabelle, eyes still staring, surgical clip still 
               attached to her lips, purple bruises on her neck.

               Tudor turns, his body contracting around the pit of his 
               stomach. After a moment he manages to straighten up and 
               stagger from the apartment, having at least enough presence 
               of mind to take his attaché case, which he left by the door, 
               and to close the door behind him.

               INT. ANNABELLE'S APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

               Dr. Roger St. Luc, tall, thin, dark, not bad-looking, stands 
               over the table staring at the corpse of Annabelle. As he 
               watches, two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and begin 
               to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor. The voice 
               of the superintendent of the building drifts over to him 
               from the other end of the apartment.

                                     SUPER (V.O.)
                         Like I said to the police officer, 
                         he paid the rent, Dr. Hobbes did. 
                         And he came around and chatted a lot 
                         with everyone here, the staff, I 
                         mean. Nice guy. Not a high and mighty 
                         type. But it was her name on the 
                         residency list and the buzzer board: 
                         Annabelle... what was it again?... 
                         Annabelle Horsefield. She never 
                         complained about anything, not to 
                         me, anyway.

               The super, a small, unshaven, harassed little man with a lot 
               of energy, is talking to a large beefy detective who writes 
               everything down in a notebook.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (pointing to 
                              Annabelle's corpse, 
                              which is just being 
                              carried out the door)
                         And that was her. Annabelle Horse... 
                         field.

                                     SUPER
                         Far as I know, yeah, that was her.

               The detective now turns to St. Luc, who is crouched on the 
               floor examining the chalk outline around where Hobbes's body 
               had lain.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Is that the man who called you up 
                         here?

                                     SUPER
                         Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the 
                         head of our little medical clinic 
                         here.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Medical clinic?

                                     SUPER
                         Yeah. This is an island, you know? 
                         Takes too long to get into the city. 
                         We gotta have everything right here 
                         or somebody complains.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Well, let's go talk to your doctor.

               The detective walks over to St. Luc and the super follows. 
               St. Luc rises to meet him. He is wearing very informal summer 
               clothes, a bit rumpled.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant 
                         Heller. I'd like to ask you a few 
                         questions.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (obviously a bit dazed 
                              by what he has been 
                              seeing)
                         Sure.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         You're the one who found the bodies?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Yes.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Did you touch anything? Move anything 
                         before we got here?

                                     ST. LUC
                         No, nothing.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         You knew these people?

                                     ST. LUC
                         I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor 
                         and a professor at university. I saw 
                         the girl around the building but I 
                         didn't know her. She never came to 
                         the clinic.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         So you just came up to visit this 
                         Hobbes and you found them like that?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes 
                         since I was in medical school. He 
                         taught me... he was my prof in urology 
                         and... I think he conducted a few 
                         seminars in psychopharmacology. That 
                         was it. I had no idea he'd ever set 
                         foot in Starliner Towers until today.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         I see. Then what brought you up here?

               St. Luc begins to pace about as he talks.

                                     ST. LUC
                         It was very strange. He called me at 
                         six this morning. Hobbes called me. 
                         I thought I was dreaming. I haven't 
                         heard that voice for so long. He 
                         told me who it was, then he said 
                         something like, 'Meet me at apartment 
                         1208 at noon. I want you to go out 
                         for lunch with me. It's time you 
                         furthered your education.' Then he 
                         laughed and hung up. I went back to 
                         sleep. He called me again at eight 
                         to remind me to come.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         How did he sound this time? Was he 
                         nervous? Depressed?

                                     ST. LUC
                         He sounded fine.

               The telephone rings. The super, who has been fiddling with a 
               window with a cracked pane of glass, grabs the phone 
               instinctively without looking at the detective, who probably 
               would have answered it himself.

                                     SUPER
                              (pause)
                         Who? No, that's not me. You got the 
                         wrong guy. Just a sec.
                              (looks up at St. Luc 
                              and holds out the 
                              phone to him)
                         It's for you. Somebody wants to know 
                         how come you didn't show up for lunch.

               The detective looks suspiciously at St. Luc, who simply looks 
               dazed.

               INT. ROLLO LINSKY'S LABORATORY -- AFTERNOON

               Next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque 
               marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown 
               paper. Rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to 
               reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and 
               accessories.

               Rollo offers some to St. Luc while stuffing one in his own 
               mouth. There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus 
               mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. Rollo 
               and St. Luc sit around Rollo's desk, a very sleek metal 
               affair.

               Rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and 
               biology room in a museum of natural history. Specimens of 
               all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, 
               floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. There are 
               also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab 
               cultures in various stages of neglect.

               There are also clippings from magazines and newspapers 
               sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which 
               are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves.

               Despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an 
               underlying order which reflects Rollo's own real discipline, 
               which is not always immediately apparent. And the microscopes 
               and glass slides, the stainless-steel gynecological table 
               complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, 
               etc., are spotless and in good shape.

               Rollo is rotund, soft-faced, and a manic-depressive. In his 
               manic phase he is a joker and an elbow-nudger, and his general 
               style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, 
               is broad North-American Jewish. In his depressive phase, he 
               becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his 
               character.

               Rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment 
               on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.

                                     ROLLO
                         Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes 
                         would have laid on you, Rog, but 
                         it's all I got, and...
                              (places hand on heart, 
                              leans over 
                              confidentially)
                         ...all I got I share with you. Go 
                         ahead. Take all you want.

                                     ST. LUC
                         You touch my spleen, Rollo.
                              (they giggle at an 
                              old medical-school 
                              reference)
                         And here all the time I was thinking -- 
                         if I ever bothered to think about 
                         the good old days -- well, at least 
                         there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's 
                         happy.

                                     ROLLO
                         I'm still a VD man under the skin, 
                         Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth 
                         kinda guy, right?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, at least you still talk the 
                         same.

                                     ROLLO
                         So who changes?

                                     ST. LUC
                         But you gave up your private practice. 
                         Suddenly you're into pure research 
                         and you... you're what, a 
                         parasitologist?

                                     ROLLO
                         That was my father's idea... private 
                         practice. He wanted to set me up -- 
                         I couldn't say no. But he's dead 
                         now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I 
                         gotta do research. Look at that 
                         beautiful stuff...
                              (gestures everywhere)
                         ...lookit it!

               He jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and jumps 
               to his feet, smiling broadly.

                                     ROLLO
                              (with great enthusiasm, 
                              indicating the entire 
                              lab)
                         This is the 'Satyr's Tongue'!

               He pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it. He opens 
               the book at the marked page and hands it to St. Luc. As St. 
               Luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue hanging 
               out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists 
               thought the ground-up tongue of the satyr could cure any 
               disease, Rollo continues to talk.

                                     ROLLO
                         The note includes a warning against 
                         swallowing the tongue whole, but we 
                         don't see the rest of this caution. 
                         'Satyr's Tongue' was Hobbes's code 
                         name for our project. What we were 
                         trying to do was to find an 
                         alternative to organ transplants.

               As Rollo speaks, he walks all over the place, picking up and 
               discarding various charts, specimens, bottled and diseased 
               human organs, etc.

               As he moves around, we catch glimpses of Letrasetted signs 
               that Rollo has tacked up: 'Sex is the invention of a clever 
               venereal disease -- Hobbes'; 'Dr. Hobbes's prescription: 
               starve a fever, feed an obsession'; 'The road of excess leads 
               to knowledge'; plus several pictures of satyrs with their 
               tongues sticking out, being cut off by alchemists, etc.

                                     ROLLO
                         I know. You're bored already. 
                         Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, 
                         right?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (shaking his head in 
                              protest)
                         Did I say anything?

                                     ROLLO
                              (excited, waving 
                              specimens of parasites 
                              and diseased organs 
                              around)
                         Look. You got men, you got parasites 
                         that live in, on, and around men. 
                         Now. Why not breed a parasite that 
                         does something useful? Eh? Why not 
                         breed a parasite capable of taking 
                         over the function of any one of a 
                         bunch of human organs? Why not, for 
                         example, a parasite living in the 
                         human abdominal cavity that plugs 
                         into the circulatory system and 
                         filters the blood like a kidney? If 
                         it takes a little blood for itself, 
                         so what? Be generous! You can afford 
                         it.

               He is now in full flight. He leans over St. Luc and begins 
               to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on St. Luc's 
               stomach with his fingers. St. Luc can't hide his amusement.

                                     ROLLO
                         You put the bug into the body of a 
                         man with a diseased kidney, the bug 
                         attacks the bad kidney, dissolves 
                         it, it's assimilated by the body, 
                         and now you got a perfectly good 
                         parasite where you used to have a 
                         rotten kidney. I know what you're 
                         gonna say. You're gonna say it's 
                         crazy.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (laughing)
                         It's crazy.

               Rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle.

                                     ROLLO
                         Right. It's crazy. But here's the 
                         beauty part. Ready?
                              (leans forward for 
                              emphasis)
                         Who cares?

                                     ST. LUC
                         I don't get it.

                                     ROLLO
                         You know and I know that Hobbes was 
                         a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, 
                         academic, afraid of women, lousy. 
                         But he was always a genius at one 
                         thing -- getting grants. Could he 
                         get grants for crazy projects?

               St. Luc is about to say something, but Rollo answers his own 
               rhetorical question with a flip of the hand, effectively 
               silencing St. Luc.

                                     ROLLO
                         You know who pays the rent here? Eh? 
                         The Northern Hemisphere Organ 
                         Transplant Society. And that's for 
                         something that's supposed to put 
                         them outta business. And they're not 
                         the only ones. We got grant money 
                         coming out of our ears.

               He leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical 
               journals like the Journal of Venereal Disease, etc. He shoves 
               them under St. Luc's nose, then grabs a jar with a 
               disintegrating octopus-like creature in it and a sandwich at 
               the same time. He smacks down the sandwich in front of St. 
               Luc by mistake, then retrieves it and substitutes the jar 
               with the specimen.

               St. Luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen.

               As St. Luc looks at the papers, Rollo breathes heavily down 
               his neck and points out things of interest.

                                     ROLLO
                         See? There? You take a little of 
                         this... that's a very rare venereal 
                         disease you get in the nomadic Crinua 
                         people, Northeast Asia and Japan.
                              (points to a sexy 
                              picture of a Japanese 
                              lady in heat)
                         Oo. That one's got it bad. They call 
                         it Batinh. That means 'kiss' or 
                         'caress.' When you get it it makes 
                         your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss 
                         everything. I even had it once. I 
                         always get everything at least once 
                         so I know what the patient's talking 
                         about.
                              (he laughs but he's 
                              serious)
                         And there... you take a little of 
                         that... that's beautiful, isn't it? 
                         That's Flexipes, the world's only 
                         cephalopod parasite.
                              (indicating the jar)
                         That's him right there. Not a very 
                         good specimen. Related to squids and 
                         octopuses. See? He lives in the guts 
                         of whales and big dolphins.
                              (wiggles a finger at 
                              the specimen)
                         Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't 
                         ya? Yeah.

               He walks away from the desk. His manner is now more subdued 
               and reflective. It seems as though everything he says provokes 
               a dozen unspoken thoughts. His depressive phase is beginning.

                                     ROLLO
                         We don't do it all here, we send out 
                         to have tricky stuff done... the 
                         cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal 
                         fission, all that fancy close work.

               Rollo sighs heavily. St. Luc gently shoves all the papers 
               aside.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself?

               Rollo toys with the gynecological examination table, sliding 
               the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars.

                                     ROLLO
                              (shrugging)
                         Funny in the head. High suicide rate 
                         in the medical profession. Too much 
                         body, alla time bodies, bodies.

               He now gets close to St. Luc, putting an arm around his 
               shoulder.

                                     ROLLO
                         Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. 
                         Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I 
                         want you to come into this with me. 
                         To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm 
                         lonely.
                              (begins to pace around 
                              again)
                         All Hobbes ever did was run around 
                         getting money and phone me in the 
                         middle of the night. He wanted you 
                         in anyway. That's why we were gonna 
                         get together, the three of us. We 
                         would have enough to keep us going 
                         for at least five years, even with 
                         inflation.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (a bit uncomfortable 
                              being put on the 
                              spot)
                         Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always 
                         a GP.

                                     ROLLO
                              (almost angrily)
                         You want to help sick people for the 
                         rest of your life? God forbid I should 
                         talk you out of it.

                                     ST. LUC
                         You oughta be careful yourself. Might 
                         end up cutting your throat.

                                     ROLLO
                         It was women did it to Hobbes. 
                         Couldn't handle them. That girl, 
                         that Annabelle -- talk about crazy 
                         projects.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Who was she?

                                     ROLLO
                              (reluctant to talk)
                         Aw, he met her when he was lecturing 
                         at some private girls' school. They 
                         caught him examining her little tits 
                         for breast cancer in the faculty 
                         lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. 
                         It was craziness, believe me.
                              (indicating the 
                              gynecological table)
                         They used to come here sometimes.
                              (shakes his head)
                         Don't ask.

               He starts to run down like a spring-wound toy at the end of 
               its run. He glances at a picture of Annabelle stuck in a 
               corner, which St. Luc just notices for the first time.

                                     ROLLO
                         I'll never really understand how he 
                         could do what he did to her.

               St. Luc looks at his watch and gets up out of his chair for 
               the first time.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, Rollo Linsky... I gotta go 
                         open up the store. It's been great 
                         to see you again.

               He moves toward the door. Rollo trails after him, head down, 
               obviously dejected.

                                     ROLLO
                         Yeah, sure.

               They shake hands. St. Luc has to open the door himself -- 
               Rollo is really preoccupied. Finally he looks St. Luc in the 
               eye.

                                     ROLLO
                         But you'll think about what I said 
                         about working together, huh?

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. I'll think about it.

               Rollo manages a smile. St. Luc leaves, closing the door behind 
               him.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               In his bathroom, Nick Tudor cleans his teeth with the water-
               pick as usual. The sounds of Janine bustling about with 
               breakfast filter into the bathroom. Tudor hums tunelessly.

               Suddenly, he doubles over in a soundless spasm of pain. The 
               water-pick writhes in the sink, shooting water on to the 
               mirror and over the floor.

               After a moment he straightens up and begins to press around 
               the area of his navel, obviously looking for lumps which it 
               seems -- from his expression -- he has already found and is 
               overly familiar with.

               The water-pick continues to rattle around in the sink. Janine 
               pokes her head around the corner to investigate. Tudor tries 
               to cover up, grabs the water-pick, and begins to work on his 
               teeth again, hiding the occasional twinge that hits him.

                                     JANINE
                         You say something?

                                     TUDOR
                         Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of 
                         my hands. That's all.

               Janine waits for Tudor to say something else. He ignores 
               her.

                                     JANINE
                              (after a pause)
                         You sure you're OK, Nick?

               Tudor continues to ignore her. Janine sighs in a very obvious 
               way and disappears. Tudor waits for a second, turns off the 
               water-pick, then checks out his stomach again.

               INT. WOMEN'S SAUNA -- AFTERNOON

               Janine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head 
               and middle. Next to her sits Betts, who is in her early 
               forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her 
               hair short for efficiency's sake. In her relationship with 
               Janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. 
               She has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created 
               her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to 
               the neurotic vivacity of Janine, who is ten years her junior 
               and has never known independence.

               They are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, 
               Benda Sviben, now a full-fledged resident of Starliner Towers. 
               She is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly 
               thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other 
               two full-bodied women.

               Betts is in the middle of giving Janine advice about Tudor's 
               disease.

                                     BETTS
                         ...probably nothing at all. It's 
                         probably just a bunch of, I don't 
                         know, fatty cysts. You can have them 
                         removed in a doctor's office. Has 
                         Nick seen a doctor?

                                     JANINE
                         He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. 
                         He never goes to doctors.

                                     BETTS
                         Well, look. How's this? You go on 
                         down to the clinic and tell that 
                         nice Dr. St. Luc...
                              (pauses to work it 
                              out)
                         ...you tell him that Nick's ill, 
                         he's got these lumps, and he can't 
                         get out of bed. Tell him to come 
                         when you're sure Nick'll be home. 
                         And don't tell Nick anything. Let 
                         the two of them fight it out.

                                     JANINE
                              (not displeased with 
                              the idea)
                         He'll be really mad.

                                     BETTS
                              (with a conspiratorial 
                              smile)
                         So? You'll find out what's wrong and 
                         then you'll be able to relax a little 
                         bit. Let him be the uptight one for 
                         a change.

               She stretches out full length on the bench, her toes bumping 
               Benda's thigh. Betts notices Benda for the first time.

                                     BETTS
                              (to Benda)
                         Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you 
                         here before, have I?

               Benda draws her towel around her, wide-eyed, completely 
               intimidated by Betts. She manages a nervous smile.

               INT. TUDOR'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Tudor's secretary, a lumpy and motherly lady named Mrs. 
               Wheatley -- she has a nameplate on her desk -- is shuffling 
               some papers when the telephone rings.

               Her small cubicle of an office is appended to Tudor's only 
               slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building. 
               The door leading to Tudor's office is closed.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Ashen & Gaunt, Insurance Appraisals. 
                         Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I'll 
                         buzz him.

               She places the caller on 'hold' and presses the inter-office 
               buzzer. She directs her attention for a moment to the papers 
               on her desk. When, after a pause, she notices that Tudor 
               hasn't answered the phone, she releases the caller from 'hold' 
               and picks up the receiver.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'll 
                         put you on 'hold' again and see if I 
                         can find Mr. Tudor.

               Mrs. Wheatley pushes the 'hold' button and gets out of her 
               chair. She knocks gently on the door.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas? There's a call for you.

               Perplexed by Tudor's failure to respond, Mrs. Wheatley 
               gingerly opens the door.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas? It's that man whose 
                         Lamborghini caught fire on St. 
                         Catherine Street and burned to the 
                         ground. He's very angry...

               She catches a glimpse of Tudor rolling around on the floor 
               behind his desk, his swivel chair tipped over on to its side.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas! What happened?

               She rushes over to Tudor and helps him to his feet. Tudor is 
               breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on 
               the desk while Mrs. Wheatley straightens up the chair for 
               him.

               Tudor collapses into the chair, mumbling and rolling his 
               head from side to side. Mrs. Wheatley pulls a Kleenex from 
               her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming 
               from one corner of Tudor's mouth.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         We're going to get you to a hospital. 
                         That's what we're going to do.

                                     TUDOR
                              (beginning to come 
                              around)
                         No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all 
                         right.

               Mrs. Wheatley shows Tudor the spot of blood on her Kleenex.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Do you see this? This is blood. It 
                         came from your insides. That means 
                         it's serious. Probably an ulcer. You 
                         executives are all the same.

               Tudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk, 
               still pretty wobbly.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                              (smoothing the hair 
                              back from Tudor's 
                              forehead in a very 
                              motherly fashion)
                         Now, Nicholas, it doesn't cost 
                         anything to be sure everything's all 
                         right. I think you should definitely 
                         go to the emergency ward and...

                                     TUDOR
                              (abruptly, swiveling 
                              away from Mrs. 
                              Wheatley's hand)
                         Call me a cab, will you please, Mona? 
                         I'm going home for the day.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                         Nicholas, I think...

                                     TUDOR
                         I don't care what you think. Please 
                         call me a cab. Now.

               Mrs. Wheatley steps away from the desk, obviously hurt by 
               Tudor's brusqueness.

                                     MRS. WHEATLEY
                              (mollifyingly)
                         All right, Nicholas. All right.

               She leaves, closing the door behind her.

               Tudor sighs, taking a deep breath. He is suddenly hit by 
               another twinge of pain. He clutches his stomach. Blood 
               trickles out of the corner of his mouth. After a pause, he 
               licks the blood off his lips with the tip of his tongue.

               INT. CLINIC RECEPTION AT STARLINER TOWERS -- AFTERNOON

               The Starliner Towers Medical Clinic is small but complete. 
               Dr. St. Luc and his nurse, Forsythe, are backed up by a 
               secretary-receptionist who sits behind a desk surrounded by 
               filing cabinets at the end of the hallway which serves as 
               reception area. There are chairs lined up against one wall, 
               flanked by coffee tables piled high with the traditional two-
               year-old magazines.

               Three or four people sit waiting to see St. Luc, among them 
               the aging but sprightly Mr. Parkins and Janine Tudor. Parkins, 
               who considers himself something of a ladies' man, is talking 
               to Janine when St. Luc appears and looks at the list of 
               patients who have signed in.

                                     PARKINS
                         ...and this Kriedler seems to think 
                         that mega-vitamin therapy may be the 
                         answer to the question of aging. 
                         That's not to suggest that the aging 
                         process is in any way reversible -- 
                         I don't think for a minute that it 
                         is -- but it may be stoppable, and 
                         that's where mega-vitamins come in...

               St. Luc gestures to Janine to follow him into his office. 
               Janine gets up, excusing herself to Mr. Parkins.

                                     JANINE
                         Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go.

               She follows St. Luc into his office. He closes the door behind 
               her.

               INT. TAXICAB -- AFTERNOON

               The cab carrying Tudor pulls up at the main doors of the 
               Towers. Tudor, still a bit unsteady, signs a chit for the 
               driver and gets out of the car.

               INT. LOBBY -- AFTERNOON

               The doorman opens both doors for Tudor as he enters the 
               building.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Afternoon, Mr. Tudor.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Janine sits opposite St. Luc, who has a file open before him 
               on his desk.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, there's certainly nothing here 
                         in this check-up I did for your 
                         husband's company last year. Blood 
                         pressure a touch high, cholesterol 
                         count nice and low...
                              (looking Janine in 
                              the eye)
                         I just can't see cancer developing 
                         that fast, Janine, not the way you've 
                         described it. Could be swollen glands 
                         or something, I don't know.

                                     JANINE
                              (a bit relieved but 
                              still tense)
                         You'll come up and take a look at 
                         him?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (standing up)
                         If he can't make it down here... 
                         sure. That's what I'm here for. But 
                         it won't be until, oh...
                              (checking his watch)
                         ...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late?

               Janine smiles and shakes her head. Just gotta have time to 
               put the clinic to bed for the night and grab some supper.

                                     JANINE
                         That's great, Doctor. Thanks.

               Janine gets up, opens the door to the reception area, and 
               leaves, closing the door behind her.

               St. Luc keeps staring at Tudor's file, shifts something from 
               one side of the folder to the other. Something bothers him.

               The door to one of the examination rooms opens and Forsythe 
               pops her head around the corner.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, 
                         Doctor.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.

               Forsythe disappears. St. Luc studies Tudor's file.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attaché 
               case on to a chair. He loosens his tie and makes himself a 
               drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the TV 
               set.

               After only a short moment of relative calm, Tudor suddenly 
               contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to 
               the floor. He rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his 
               head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of 
               water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension.

               He soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm 
               of pain apparently over. He keeps both hands clamped over 
               his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of 
               vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom.

               Once in the bathroom, Tudor throws himself over the side of 
               the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the 
               tub itself.

               He gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on 
               the floor, mouth bloody. In the tub, a trail of blood-streaked 
               slime leads into the drain.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Forsythe comes out to the reception area from an examination 
               room, checks out the patient list, and beckons to Mr. Parkins.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         I'm ready for you now, Brad.

               Parkins gets up and follows Forsythe into one of the 
               examination rooms.

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Once inside the examination room, Forsythe closes the door 
               and hands Parkins a hospital tunic.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Now, you just take off all your 
                         clothes, put this on, and hop up on 
                         to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll 
                         be in to see you in a few minutes.

                                     PARKINS
                              (as Forsythe begins 
                              to leave)
                         You don't have to go. I'm not shy.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still 
                         working, you know.

               Forsythe leaves. Parkins chuckles to himself -- 'still life 
               in the old boy yet' kind of feeling -- and begins to undress.

               INT. TUDOR'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Tudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom, wiping 
               his mouth with a facecloth. He sits down on a chair facing 
               the sliding glass door which leads to the apartment's balcony.

               He breathes heavily, gasping for air. His expression is a 
               dazed one and he mumbles incoherently. After a moment's rest 
               he rises, opens the glass door, and steps out on to the 
               balcony.

               EXT. TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

               Tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony, 
               gulping down the air, scanning the lights of the tower 
               opposite.

               Suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again, his mouth 
               seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle 
               and jawbone, his hands fly up to his mouth in an attempt to 
               keep down whatever is about to come up.

               Hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler 
               in a rough sea, Tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs 
               on for dear life as he retches, gags, moans, and finally 
               vomits.

               EXT. GROUNDS BELOW TUDOR'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

               Two elderly women, Vi and Olive, are taking a leisurely 
               evening stroll at the base of Tudor's tower. They both hold 
               small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly 
               along the path bordering the lawn.

               Suddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited 
               by Tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is 
               heard. A large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's 
               umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a 
               heavy, blood-soaked sponge. The force of the blow almost 
               twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and 
               she gives a little cry of surprise.

               Her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her 
               balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she 
               sees the blood.

               The first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not 
               react with such surprise.

                                     FIRST LADY
                              (examining the bloodied 
                              umbrella)
                         Aw. Poor birdie. They're always 
                         crashing into tall buildings. It's 
                         such a shame, such a shame. The 
                         windows fool them, you know.

               The creature, the second parasite to emerge from Tudor's 
               body, lies in the grass, away from the bright cones of light 
               thrown by the tower's lawn lamps. We can barely make out its 
               bloody, twitching form.

               Beyond the parasite is a basement window through which is 
               visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers. 
               The window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar 
               of laundry soap.

               The first lady makes a move to find the injured creature, 
               but her companion tightens her grip on the old lady's arm.

                                     COMPANION
                         Come along, Olive.

                                     FIRST LADY
                         Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just 
                         been hurt. Maybe we should look for 
                         him!

                                     COMPANION
                              (pulling Olive along)
                         Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven 
                         now, whatever it is. Won't help at 
                         all for you to get into a fuss and 
                         muddle over it. Now come along and 
                         let's finish up our little evening 
                         stroll and get you tucked up in bed 
                         in front of the color TV.

               The two women walk off down the path, Vi's voice fading away 
               in the shadows.

                                     COMPANION
                         You know what a restless night you 
                         have if you don't get your two hours 
                         of color TV, dear, so let's bustle 
                         along and get our walk over with, 
                         shall we...?

               INT. ST. LUC'S EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is examining Mr. Parkins. Parkins sits on the 
               examination table with the hospital tunic on.

               St. Luc presses gently around Parkins' abdomen in the area 
               of the navel.

                                     PARKINS
                         Ow! Better take it easy. There's a 
                         lot of pressure in there!

               St. Luc stops pressing and takes up his stethoscope. He begins 
               to percuss the old man's abdomen.

                                     PARKINS
                         Want me to breathe deeply?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Just breathe normally.

               St. Luc finishes percussing, removes the stethoscope from 
               his ears, and stands back thoughtfully.

                                     PARKINS
                              (confidentially)
                         Good shape for an old man, eh?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (after a pause)
                         Mr. Parkins, what makes you think 
                         you caught these lumps of yours from 
                         a young lady?

                                     PARKINS
                         She had a couple just like them. 
                         Right here near her belly button. 
                         You could push 'em around. I thought 
                         they were kinda sexy, myself.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Didn't she ever have these lumps 
                         looked at by a doctor?

                                     PARKINS
                              (shrugs)
                         Didn't seem worried about them.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Was this girl from Starliner Towers?

                                     PARKINS
                         Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually 
                         went to my place. Bigger liquor 
                         cabinet, bigger bed.
                              (chuckles, then gets 
                              serious)
                         She was gone when I got back from my 
                         last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a 
                         beautiful tan.
                              (smiles again)
                         Must have gone home to mother.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?

                                     PARKINS
                         That's the one.

               St. Luc sits down at the counter beneath the medicine cabinet 
               and begins to write in Parkins' file.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, you can get dressed now, Mr. 
                         Parkins.

               The old man begins to put his shirt and tie back on.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (handing Parkins a 
                              slip of paper)
                         I'm going to send you to the hospital 
                         to have a few X-rays taken. I want 
                         to find out exactly what you're hiding 
                         in there, OK? Give them this. The 
                         address is right there under 
                         Radiology.

                                     PARKINS
                         Gonna cut me open?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

                                     PARKINS
                         Used to know a doctor who said he 
                         got to know his patients better than 
                         their wives did.
                              (chuckles)
                         Cutting a man open sure does expose 
                         more of him than pulling down his 
                         pants, gotta admit that.

               St. Luc smiles politely, his mind obviously elsewhere.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

               A bar of laundry soap props open the window of the laundry 
               room. The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only 
               by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of 
               wall immediately below the window.

               The hand of an old woman, puckered and wrinkled from many 
               hours submerged in hot soapy water, reaches up, and yanks 
               the bar of soap out of the jaws of the window. The window 
               swing shut. The woman's hand slides the bolt home, locking 
               the window from the inside.

               The old woman is short, dumpy, puffy-faced, in her late 
               sixties. Her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her 
               head.

               She sniffles, shakes her head, turns away from the window, 
               and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and 
               dryers. As she walks she has to thread her way among the 
               dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry -- against 
               apartment regulations, she takes in outsiders' laundry -- 
               which she has brought down the elevator with her.

               She flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig 
               clothes out of the nearest shopping bag.

               From above and behind the washer, we watch her fill the 
               machine and reach into the front of her dress, which is black 
               and frayed. After feeling around for a few seconds, she pulls 
               out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent. 
               She dumps some of this into the washer, finds the appropriate 
               coins in the pocket of her dress, and starts the machine.

               She watches it for a second to make sure it's working 
               properly, then puts the plastic bag back where she found it. 
               She picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in 
               her ragged slippers to the next washer. She stops in front 
               of it and puts down the bag.

               The old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of 
               the washer. She grimaces, grabs a sock from the bag and cleans 
               off the top of the washer with it. She tosses the sock into 
               the washer and leans over the hole, trying to see inside.

               The parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly 
               springs from the opening on to the old woman's face, suckering 
               on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles. She shrieks and 
               grabs at the creature with both hands, trying to pull it 
               off.

               She stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over 
               various shopping bags. Finally she goes down amidst her 
               laundry, thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere.

               INT. STARLINER TOWERS GROCERY STORE -- NIGHT

               In the grocery store built into the base of one of the towers, 
               Janine flips through some magazines, finally buying a Vogue.

               She stops to look at several shelves of various kinds of 
               food, picking up this and that, but somehow the thought of 
               cooking or even eating repulses her, and she leaves without 
               buying anything but the magazine.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine walks along a hallway, stops at a door, knocks gently, 
               and then opens the door and walks in, obviously very familiar 
               with the occupant.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine enters Betts' apartment. Betts is sitting cross-legged 
               in leotards on the broadloom, a number of very large black-
               and-white photographs spread out in front of her. As she 
               speaks to Janine, she arranges and rearranges them.

               Other equipment and graphics of various kinds stuck on walls, 
               hidden in corners and lying on chairs and tables suggest 
               that Betts is in advertising and commercial graphics.

               Janine stands halfway in the door.

                                     JANINE
                         Hi.

                                     BETTS
                         Hi. Want a drink?

                                     JANINE
                         No thanks. Just wanted to tell you 
                         that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see 
                         Nick at ten or so.

                                     BETTS
                         Was he nice to you?

               Janine nods.

                                     BETTS
                         Good. Well...
                              (takes a sip from a 
                              glass on the floor 
                              next to her)
                         I've ordered in some vrai cuisine 
                         française from Jean-Phillipe at the 
                         Côte d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in 
                         garlic butter... the works. They 
                         have lovely strong delivery boys who 
                         fight their way through sleet and 
                         hail and the gloom of night just to 
                         bring me my coq au vin. And after 
                         Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's 
                         nothing wrong with Nick that a 
                         vacation won't cure, and if Nick 
                         falls asleep early again, you just 
                         come on back here for company and a 
                         late supper. You hear me?

               Janine nods.

                                     BETTS
                         Now, I mean it. I always order enough 
                         for two and I'll just get fat and 
                         lonely if you don't show up.

               Janine wiggles her fingers goodbye and leaves.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine walks down the hallway to her apartment, her Vogue 
               rolled up under her arm. She opens the door to her apartment -- 
               it's not locked -- and goes in.

               A moment after she's gone and closed the door, two children 
               about ten years old appear around a corner, giggling and 
               jostling each other. They approach Tudor's apartment.

                                     GIRL
                         C'mon, let's smoke one of the 
                         cigarettes right now. Your father'll 
                         never miss it.

                                     BOY
                         I can't, dummy. He'll see that the 
                         pack's been opened. You're such a 
                         dumbhead.

                                     GIRL
                         OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the 
                         store and buy my own pack and smoke 
                         'em all myself.

                                     BOY
                         Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?

                                     GIRL
                              (flipping open a milk 
                              box)
                         With some milk jugs I just happened 
                         to pick up on the way home.

               The first box she tries is empty. She advances to the next 
               and the next, finally finding one that has a jug in it. She 
               takes it and advances to Tudor's box, jug swinging, companion 
               trailing after her in admiration. She stops at Tudor's milk 
               box and flicks the door open.

               She looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles 
               back in the shadows. Ugh! What's that?

               The boy takes a look. Inside the box a third parasite can 
               just be seen clinging to a three-quart white plastic milk 
               jug. The jug is smeared with blood. The box's inside door is 
               ajar. The TV set can be heard from inside the apartment.

                                     BOY
                         I dunno. Guess the milk went bad.
                              (shrugs)
                         It's still worth money.

               The girl hesitates for a second. Suddenly the parasite 
               twitches around to the front of the jug. The girl, startled, 
               slams the box door shut.

                                     GIRL
                         Jesus!

                                     BOY
                         Let's get outta here before somebody 
                         hears us!

               The children run off down the hallway together. After a few 
               seconds, the box door is nudged open again from the inside.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine sits down in front of the TV set. After a moment or 
               two she gets up, turns the set off, and flops back down on 
               the sofa with her Vogue.

               She doesn't notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the 
               bedroom to the inside door of the milk box.

               In the bedroom, a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet 
               to reveal a naked abdomen. It is Tudor's abdomen, and he 
               reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size 
               of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel.

               Tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. He 
               gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears 
               the instant it's touched.

                                     TUDOR
                              (delirious, voice 
                              strained, whispering)
                         Come here, boy. Here, boy, here.

               He taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though 
               trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers.

               He is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half-dressed. 
               He looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with 
               maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright.

                                     TUDOR
                         Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and 
                         me, we're gonna be friends, aren't 
                         we?

               We can now see that the sheets are twisted, the pillows half 
               off the bed. Tudor begins drumming on his abdomen.

               Gradually, cautiously, the lump under Tudor's skin returns. 
               He tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks 
               back, almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again.

               Tudor seems disappointed.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm 
                         not going to hurt you. Not going to 
                         hurt you. We're going to be friends. 
                         Friends.

               The lump returns again. Gently, Tudor begins stroking it. 
               The lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly, the rhythm 
               strangely masturbatory.

                                     TUDOR
                              (soothingly)
                         Attaboy.
                              (closing his eyes in 
                              bliss and smiling 
                              again)
                         Attaboy.

               In the living room, Janine suddenly realizes that if the TV 
               set was on, Nick must be home.

               She gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom.

               Inside the bedroom, we see the door open. Light floods the 
               room as Janine enters. Janine sees Tudor sprawled out on the 
               bed.

                                     JANINE
                         Nick? I didn't know you were home. 
                         What's wrong? What are you doing? 
                         You're almost falling out of bed. 
                         How are you feeling?

               Tudor twists around to see who has spoken, eyes wide but now 
               unsmiling. With the same motion, he pulls the covers over 
               his abdomen to hide the lumps from Janine.

               Janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant, then 
               approaches the bedside. She moves as though her hands were 
               tied at her sides, as though she is quite consciously holding 
               herself together.

                                     JANINE
                              (tenderly, but with 
                              caution, as though 
                              expecting a blow)
                         Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I 
                         see those bumps on your tummy, can 
                         I?

               She reaches out to pull back the covers again, but he rolls 
               away from her.

                                     TUDOR
                         Go away. Leave me alone.

               Janine straightens up. Her hands come up to her face and 
               tears well up in her eyes.

                                     JANINE
                              (frustrated)
                         Oh, why won't you let me help you?

               She turns and walks angrily out of the room, slamming the 
               door behind her.

               Tudor rolls over slowly on to his back, eyes wide and shining, 
               smiling again.

                                     TUDOR
                              (murmuring)
                         Attaboy, attaboy.

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is examining a very pretty young girl who sits on 
               the examination table in a hospital tunic.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to 
                         be fine. Now if it gives you any 
                         trouble at all, any sharp pain, any 
                         unusual discharge, you come and see 
                         me right away. They can be tricky 
                         sometimes.

               Dotty nods. OK, you can get dressed. We're all through.

               The girl starts to get dressed. St. Luc scribbles something 
               in her file and then takes it with him into the adjoining 
               office, closing the door behind him.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc sits at his desk and opens Parkins' file. Forsythe, 
               about twenty-three, earthy and humorous, comes in with an 
               armful of papers and records, which she throws in groups on 
               to St. Luc's desk.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (distributing papers)
                         OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you 
                         wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, 
                         Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers 
                         published by Hobbes, Linsky, and 
                         Lefebvre in a couple of issues of 
                         the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical 
                         Association and also the Journal of 
                         the American Medical Association. 
                         And, as an added extra, a couple of 
                         odds and ends from the files I helped 
                         compile before your time here, Doctor. 
                         I thought they might interest you.

                                     ST. LUC
                         That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Do I get a kiss?

               St. Luc is absorbed in his papers and doesn't respond. 
               Forsythe prods his shoulder. He looks up at her.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Kiss, kiss?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Uh, OK. Sure.

               They kiss, St. Luc making sure that it doesn't get too heavy.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Another kiss?

                                     ST. LUC
                         C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more 
                         on the list?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         No. Dotty's the last.

               The telephone rings. St. Luc picks it up.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Yes?

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         That you, Rog?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (not recognizing the 
                              voice)
                         Yes?

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking 
                         about you.

               Realizing that the conversation is likely to be a long one, 
               Forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal locker 
               in the corner, which she opens.

               Inside are her street clothes. She begins to take off her 
               nurse's uniform in full view of St. Luc, not being obvious 
               about the distraction she's providing, but not taking pains 
               to hurry dressing or be modest either.

               In the scene that follows we cut among three basic things: 
               Rollo in his lab, talking and eating; St. Luc in his office, 
               watching Forsythe get undressed and then dressed; and Hobbes's 
               notes and scribblings, which do not necessarily have to be 
               on the screen long enough to be completely read. Hobbes's 
               notes are there more to convince the viewer that they exist 
               and to provide flavor than to transfer information.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Been glancing at some of your 
                         publications on your work with Hobbes.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               In his lab, Rollo sits at the gynecological table abandoned 
               by Hobbes. Rollo is using it as an auxiliary desk.

               On the table are several opened waxed-paper packages of beef 
               knishes and accessories. There are also several old cardboard 
               shoeboxes, some still tied with string, some opened and 
               overflowing with papers of all kinds: Hobbes's private notes.

                                     ROLLO
                              (eating a knish)
                         Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you 
                         won't find any real meat in them.

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         No? How come?

                                     ROLLO
                              (shuffling papers)
                         Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, 
                         you know? I told you that. But I 
                         didn't really know just how funny he 
                         was. See... when he kicked off, they 
                         sent all the personal secret stuff 
                         they found to his mother -- she's 
                         still alive but just barely -- and 
                         she sent everything she thought was 
                         medical to me here at the lab. I'm 
                         Hobbes's partner, right?
                              (laughs sardonically)
                         Anyway, I've been going through his 
                         papers, and what they add up to is 
                         this: Hobbes was shafting us all, 
                         me, the university, the foundations 
                         and the councils, the private labs, 
                         everybody. We never really knew what 
                         it was we were working on. Hobbes 
                         gave us each a few crumbs, but he 
                         was the only one who knew what the 
                         whole loaf would look like.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc watches as Forsythe rolls her stockings down. He 
               shuffles through Hobbes's publications.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, I bite. What does it look like?

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

                                     ROLLO
                         It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a 
                         disease to save man from his mind.'

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         I don't get it.

                                     ROLLO
                         Lemme clarify for you.

               Rollo pauses to wash down some knish with a can of Coca-Cola.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               Forsythe catches St. Luc watching her dress and smiles. St. 
               Luc swivels back to his files.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo searches through Hobbes's notes to find the relevant 
               quotes. As he does so, he drops a few crumbs of knish on the 
               page and his plump fingers brush the crumbs away, smearing 
               some meat over the words.

                                     ROLLO
                         Hobbes thought that man is an animal 
                         that thinks too much, an animal that 
                         has lost touch with his instinct, 
                         his 'primal self'... in other words, 
                         too much brain and not enough guts. 
                         And what he came up with to help our 
                         guts along was a human parasite that 
                         is... lemme find it here... 'a 
                         combination of aphrodisiac and 
                         venereal disease, a modern version 
                         of the satyr's tongue.'

               Rollo pauses and flips to a new note with the heading 
               ANNABELLE underlined in red: 'She is becoming a new creature 
               before my eyes. It is like living at the Dawn of Creation. I 
               am euphoric, I am in ecstasy.'

                                     ROLLO
                         But the important thing for you is 
                         this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a 
                         guinea pig. He implanted her with 
                         the thing. I figure that once the 
                         parasites took, Annabelle went 
                         berserk. I dunno what she did, but 
                         Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had 
                         to kill her. And he wasn't trying to 
                         burn her, he was burning them, all 
                         of them.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc watches Forsythe, who is halfway through getting her 
               street clothes on. He toys with the Velakofsky file, which 
               contains abdominal X-rays showing dark, blurred masses inside 
               the abdominal cavity.

                                     ST. LUC
                         He didn't make it.

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         Huh?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but 
                         Annabelle was a pretty popular girl 
                         around Starliner Towers. I've got 
                         three men here, maybe four, who're 
                         hosting large, free-moving, apparently 
                         pathogenic, abdominal growths that 
                         nobody I've tried can identify. You 
                         were next on my list.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

                                     ROLLO
                         I'd kinda like to come over there 
                         and have a look at one of these guys.

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                         I've got a date with one of them at 
                         ten. Can you make it?

                                     ROLLO
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         Ah, I don't want to panic you or 
                         anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes 
                         designed them, they're supposed to 
                         get out of hand real quick, so you 
                         don't have much time to think about 
                         what's happening to you. Once they 
                         decide to start pumping all those 
                         dynamite juices into the old blood 
                         stream... I dunno. But if you see 
                         some people doing kind of compulsive, 
                         maybe even bizarre sexual things...

                                     ST. LUC (V.O.)
                              (laughing: he doesn't 
                              take this aspect too 
                              seriously)
                         Yeah? What do I do then?

                                     ROLLO
                         I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you 
                         can get at them, there's a lotta 
                         stuff you can use. I'll bring a 
                         bagful. It's just the standard 
                         tropical kit. But the trick is to 
                         get at them.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               Forsythe has finished dressing and is waiting for St. Luc to 
               get off the phone.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, 
                         Starliner Towers. May as well go 
                         there directly.

                                     ROLLO (V.O.)
                         OK, Rog. See you at ten.

               St. Luc hangs up.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Roger? If you're going to be staying 
                         here anyway, why don't you come up 
                         to my place for a late supper?

                                     ST. LUC
                         Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take 
                         a while.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (innocently)
                         Doesn't matter to me how late it is. 
                         I can keep it warm.

               St. Luc pushes his papers aside for a moment and stretches 
               in his swivel chair.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Anything wrong?

                                     ST. LUC
                         No. I don't think so.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Well? Supper at my place?

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK. But late.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (happy because she 
                              knows she can get 
                              him to stay overnight)
                         Great! Go back to your files. Bye.

               She leaves, closing the door behind her. St. Luc swivels 
               thoughtfully in his chair for a second or two, then turns 
               back to his files.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA -- NIGHT

               Forsythe walks through the darkened and deserted reception 
               area to the elevators. Through the main doors we see a 
               delivery van parked in the main driveway.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               A young man aged about twenty-five -- Kurt, the delivery 
               boy, dark, intense, bearded, his manner as stiff and formal 
               as the tuxedo that he wears -- rolls a restaurant serving 
               cart toward the main doors. He has obviously just come from 
               the van outside, which is emblazoned with the words 
               'Restaurant Côte d'Azur'.

               The doorman smiles and opens the door for Kurt, obviously 
               familiar with the restaurant. Kurt takes great care as he 
               lifts the cart slightly so that it clears the doormats. On 
               the cart's two levels is an elaborate array of silver serving 
               vessels and utensils.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Elevator doors slide open and Kurt steps out, pushing his 
               cart. He walks down the hallway looking for Betts's apartment. 
               After he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is 
               slightly ajar.

               As Kurt approaches, the door opens wider to reveal the old 
               woman from the laundry room. She is no longer wearing her 
               dumpy laundry clothes, however, but is dressed in a 
               translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of make-
               up. She is careful to keep half her face hidden behind the 
               door.

               Kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her. He is just 
               approaching her when she calls to him.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'm hungry!

               Kurt keeps on moving. He is now just passing her door. The 
               old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'm hungry!

               Kurt can't resist turning to look at her, although he keeps 
               moving. When he looks her in the eye, she eases out slightly 
               from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been 
               horribly burned by the laundry-room parasite, the eye melted 
               shut, the nostril drooping.

               Kurt is so stunned that he slows. The old woman speaks softly.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Hungry for love. Hungry for love.

               She suddenly reaches out and grabs Kurt by his tux with both 
               hands and, with tremendous energy, jerks him back into her 
               apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious kick.

               Kurt's cart remains out in the hallway, the food steaming.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               In her dining room, Betts mixes herself a drink and checks 
               her watch. She takes a sip, then goes into the bathroom and 
               bends over the bathtub, having balanced her drink on the 
               edge of the tub.

               From inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the plug 
               in the plughole.

               Betts turns on the water, adjusting the proportion of hot to 
               cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it, then 
               gets undressed.

               She wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out 
               to the living room with her drink in hand. In the living 
               room, she arranges her photos in a new order, props them up 
               against the sofa, changes them around again.

               Back in the bathroom, Betts checks the temperature of the 
               water by swishing her hand around in it. The water drums 
               heavily on the floor of the tub. Betts puts her drink on the 
               edge of the tub and turns the water off.

               She now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the 
               tub. She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her 
               sandals on the bathmat, then picks up her drink and stretches 
               back. She takes a big slug of her drink. Her toes curl in 
               pleasure.

               The drain plug begins to jerk and twitch, as though something 
               were trying to push it out from inside the drain.

               Betts sinks down in the water until her hair, short as it 
               is, begins to float a bit.

               The drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until 
               it is pushed right out of its plug hole. The water begins to 
               run out of the drain, but only in a slight trickle -- the 
               drain pipe is blocked by a soft, spongy body.

               Betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the 
               tub, smiling, relaxed, enjoying the sensation.

               One of the parasite's stubby tentacles slowly appears, probing 
               out of the drain hole. Then another appears, then another.

               Betts puts down her drink on the tub's edge and reaches for 
               the soap and washcloth. Her eyes are half-closed and a smile 
               still flickers about her lips. The sound of water suddenly 
               rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her 
               reverie.

               She sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub. 
               The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the 
               tub, almost touching her legs, which are pressed together 
               against one side of the tub. The water is becoming pink with 
               the blood that diffuses through it.

               Betts' mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide. Her reactions 
               are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently 
               had.

               Under the water, now very shallow, the parasite's tentacles 
               touch Betts's thighs.

               Betts tries to scream but can't. The parasite suckers its 
               way between Betts' thighs. She screams a silent scream in 
               the tub, her mouth wide open, her head rolling from side to 
               side. The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the 
               water and the gurgle of the drain.

               With a spasm that shakes her whole body, Betts throws her 
               arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and 
               on to the tiles of the bathroom floor. The glass shatters. 
               After a moment or two of further silent struggle, Betts arches 
               her back, then falls into a semi-conscious stupor, slumping 
               motionless in the tub.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Nicholas Tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of the 
               covers. The physical state of his face, ghastly and 
               cadaverous, is in sharp contrast to his expression, which is 
               ecstatic, beatific, Madonna-like.

               Tudor's hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often 
               associated with pregnant women. Between his hands, in the 
               area around the navel, three lumps shift beneath the skin, 
               changing positions and pulsing rhythmically.

               As they move, Tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds, 
               a parody of a lullaby.

               In the living room, Janine sits on the couch agitatedly 
               flipping through her Vogue, now wearing large, fashionable 
               glasses with thick, tinted prescription lenses. She can't 
               seem to get into doing anything until St. Luc comes.

               She gets up and turns the TV on again, deliberately turning 
               up the volume to an uncomfortable level.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               An old man and his wife, the Spergazzis, are taking their 
               late-night constitutional through the halls of the South 
               Tower.

               Their arms are linked and they both walk with the aid of 
               canes, the ultra-modern aluminum kind with four rubber-tipped 
               prongs at the end.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Lovely, lovely evening. Very quiet, 
                         eh?

               Mrs. Spergazzi nods and smiles, patting Mr. Spergazzi's hand. 
               They round a corner which leads them down the stretch of 
               hall which passes by Tudor's door.

               As they approach Tudor's door they notice a plastic milk jug 
               lying in the hall just below the open milk-chute door.

               Mrs. Spergazzi detaches herself from her husband and bends 
               down with difficulty to pick up the jug.

                                     MRS. SPERGAZZI
                         Eh, the children in this apartment, 
                         they're such little thieves. You 
                         have to put a lock on everything.

               She puts the jug back in the milk chute. She notices the 
               blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite in the 
               chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers.

               She stares at her wrist in astonishment. She is wearing the 
               parasite like some monstrous, spongy, oozing wristwatch. She 
               tries to shake the thing off. It can't be dislodged. She 
               turns in disbelief to her husband and then screams at the 
               top of her lungs.

               Mr. Spergazzi lifts his cane and tries to strike the thing 
               with the cane's prongs. The force of his blow throws him off 
               balance and he falls, dragging his wife down with him.

               Mrs. Spergazzi moans in pain and terror. Her husband manages 
               to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing with 
               his cane. White burning fluid begins to squirt everywhere. 
               Mrs Spergazzi's forearm begins to smoke, bubble, and dissolve. 
               She becomes hysterical.

               Mr. Spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing, now with 
               some success.

               INT. FORSYTHE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               In the kitchen, a thick paperbound book called Guide to 
               Gourmet Cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen counter 
               next to the sink. There are a couple of pots and pans heating 
               on the stove.

               Forsythe picks up the book, then opens one of the pots to 
               check something. She is obviously taking a lot of care with 
               St. Luc's late supper. She puts the lid back on the pot, 
               reads a bit more, then checks the time on an electric clock 
               on the counter.

               She opens the oven door, then takes a bone-handled carving 
               fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a 
               ceramic roasting dish.

               Someone knocks on the door. Forsythe leaves her oven and 
               goes to answer it, carving fork in hand.

               She opens the door. Kresimir Sviben stands in the hallway, 
               eyes wide, insane smile on his face. He looks at Forsythe as 
               though she were a piece of steak.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Yes?

               Kresimir doesn't answer. He begins to drool, his mouth working 
               as though in anticipation of a meal. Forsythe gets a little 
               nervous.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Can I... can I help you?

               Kresimir approaches. He is visibly shaking.

                                     KRESIMIR
                              (speaking with 
                              difficulty)
                         Yes... you can... help me.

               Without warning, he lunges for Forsythe, who vainly tries to 
               slam the door in his face. Kresimir pushes his way past the 
               door and grabs Forsythe by the back of the head, trying to 
               kiss her and drooling.

               Forsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom, intending 
               to lock herself in. Kresimir throws himself at her legs, 
               managing to grab one of her feet. She doesn't fall, but holds 
               on to a cabinet and tries to pull free.

               Kresimir begins to climb up her body. Forsythe, terrified 
               and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of 
               the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder. He screams with 
               pain and loosens his grip on Forsythe long enough for her to 
               pull away, leaving her apron and part of her dress in 
               Kresimir's hands.

               She runs for the door and is gone.

               Kresimir, still on his knees, holds the apron and the piece 
               of dress to his face, breathing in Forsythe's fragrance. He 
               begins to shuffle toward the door on his knees, kissing the 
               clothes in his hands, mumbling and moaning.

                                     KRESIMIR
                         Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship 
                         at the shrine of your body, your 
                         body, your body, oh, your body...

               INT. BETTS'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               Betts lies slumped in her bathtub, her hair matted and damp, 
               her eyes open and staring. Her mouth begins to work in a 
               very sensual way, and she begins to drool slightly.

               The tub is completely empty now except for the scum of blood 
               and soap. The smashed glass is scattered all over the floor 
               near the base of the tub.

               Zombie-like, Betts rises from the tub and steps out on to 
               the floor, her feet missing the bathmat. The crunch and snap 
               of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally 
               by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom.

               The steps Betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody 
               prints on the floor.

               Betts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and tubes 
               from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make-up to her 
               face with mechanical precision.

               INT. ST. LUC'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc is reading a section of one of Hobbes's medical papers 
               in preparation for examining Tudor later on. The section we 
               see says: '...thus the theoretical organism we are now 
               considering would exhibit what I choose to call "compressed 
               evolution." This in effect means that each generation of the 
               said organism would be better adapted to inhabit and to 
               control the behavior of its host...'

               Suddenly Forsythe bursts in, out of breath, semi-hysterical, 
               tearful.

               St. Luc rises from his chair and Forsythe throws herself on 
               him, sobbing.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? 
                         What's happened?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         A man... I think I recognized him... 
                         a man who lives here. He just...
                              (breaking down)
                         ...he just attacked me for no reason 
                         at all. I just opened the door... I 
                         was making supper for you, and he 
                         grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...

               St. Luc hugs Forsythe for a moment, then holds her away from 
               him so that he can get some information out of her.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Where is he now? Do you know?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         I think I... I think I killed him. I 
                         stabbed him with something and he 
                         fell.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Will you be OK now? I've got to go 
                         to your place to see if he's still 
                         there. I've got to see if it's... if 
                         it's what we both think it is.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Oh, no! You're not leaving me here 
                         all alone. I'm going with you.

               St. Luc hesitates for a second, then grabs his black leather 
               doctor's bag.

                                     ST. LUC
                         OK, c'mon.

               They leave.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               Inside a descending elevator, a middle-aged woman and her 
               teen-aged daughter flip through a magazine together. The 
               elevator sinks toward the ground floor of the South Tower, 
               then slows and stops. They both look up at the floor numbers. 
               It's not their floor.

               The doors slide open. Nobody seems to be waiting. The mother 
               pushes the CLOSE DOOR button, a bit impatiently. A hand 
               holding a crêpe oozing red jam and sugar reaches around into 
               the elevator.

               The two women cringe, suddenly afraid. Kurt, the delivery 
               boy, steps around and into the elevator, smiling broadly, 
               eyes wide and glistening. He drools slightly. The doors slide 
               closed. Kurt offers one crêpe to each woman.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               The doorman sits beside the intercom board reading another 
               Harlequin Nurse Romance when he happens to glance up and 
               notice the elevator flashers which indicate a stuck elevator.

               He sighs, shakes his head -- always something going wrong -- 
               stuffs the pocketbook into his jacket, and gets up, taking 
               out a huge ring of keys from his pocket as he does so.

               He walks over to the metal control panel sunk into the wall 
               between the elevators and opens it with one of the keys on 
               the ring. Then, checking to make sure which elevator is the 
               stuck one, he plays with a switch which manually overrides 
               the floor selector and brings the elevator down.

               The doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is 
               finally coming down. He stands by, waiting to see who or 
               what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so 
               long, jingling his keys, trying to look stern and 
               authoritarian.

               The doors spring open. Kurt stands at the back of the 
               elevator, one arm around the young girl, who hugs him tightly. 
               The girl is finishing the last bit of one of the crêpes, 
               sucking her fingers deliciously.

               The mother sits slumped in the opposite corner, her coat 
               open, her dress torn, bruises on her face. She struggles to 
               her feet. Kurt and the girl are ignoring her.

               The doorman is nonplussed. He hesitates, then makes a move 
               toward the elevator, intending to help the woman to her feet.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Here, here. What is this all about? 
                         What's the matter with you? What are 
                         you doing in there?

               The woman suddenly lunges at the doorman and tries to pull 
               him down. Kurt detaches himself from the girl and joins her. 
               They giggle and drool all over the doorman as they pull him 
               down and pin him to the floor.

               The daughter, still licking her fingers, slowly approaches 
               the doorman.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Hey, that's enough, enough of this 
                         nonsense! What is this?
                              (Etc.)

               The daughter kneels at the doorman's feet, then crawls over 
               him, her mouth working, drooling. She lowers her lips over 
               his, Kurt making it impossible for the doorman to move his 
               head out of the way.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Forsythe and St. Luc are hurrying to Forsythe's apartment to 
               see if Kresimir is still there. As they round a corner, they 
               see the Spergazzis coming toward them, the old lady hobbling 
               and hysterical, the old man helping her walk as best he can, 
               trying to maintain some kind of calm.

               When Spergazzi sees St. Luc, he lifts his four-pronged cane 
               and waves it around to get attention.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help 
                         us!

               St. Luc and Forsythe rush over and help to support the 
               slumping Mrs. Spergazzi.

                                     ST. LUC
                         What happened?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                              (tipping his hat as 
                              he introduces himself 
                              even in the midst of 
                              chaos)
                         Please pardon me. I am Niccolo 
                         Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I 
                         don't know... we were walking in the 
                         hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... 
                         she was attacked by this thing... 
                         here, on her arm.

               Spergazzi shows St. Luc his wife's forearm, which has been 
               badly burned by the parasite's animal-tissue solvent. As 
               soon as St. Luc starts prodding her arm, Mrs. Spergazzi starts 
               to wail in Italian. Spergazzi tries to soothe her as St. Luc 
               examines her carefully.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         It's all right, cara mia. What's one 
                         more scar to an old lady, eh? You'll 
                         be OK.

               The old lady wails even more.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Where is this thing that attacked 
                         your wife?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         I hit it. I hit it with my cane. 
                         Then I carry it on the cane and I 
                         throw it down to the incinerator, 
                         down to the garbage.

               St. Luc hands his bag to Forsythe.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (to Spergazzi)
                         This is Nurse Forsythe. She's a nurse, 
                         you understand me?

               Spergazzi nods. St. Luc turns to Forsythe.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Go back to their apartment with them 
                         and treat her for second-degree burns. 
                         It'll have to do for now.
                              (to Spergazzi)
                         What's your number? The number of 
                         your apartment?

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         We live in 703.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (to Forsythe)
                         OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't 
                         leave until I get there. Lock the 
                         door and don't open it except for 
                         me. OK?

                                     FORSYTHE
                         But where are you going?

                                     ST. LUC
                              (walking away)
                         Down to the incinerator.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine dozes fitfully on the couch, her glasses fallen on to 
               the carpet, her Vogue crumpled underneath her. Tudor's voice 
               calls to her from the bedroom. It has an eerie, wailing tone 
               to it.

                                     TUDOR
                         Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into 
                         the bedroom, Janine.

               Tudor keeps calling until Janine wakes up with a start and 
               jumps to her feet, still half asleep. She rubs her eyes and 
               walks to the bedroom.

               Janine opens the bedroom door. From her point of view we see 
               a dark, blurry figure sitting on the edge of the bed.

                                     JANINE
                         Nick? Are you up? I can't see a thing, 
                         I took my contacts out.

               Tudor speaks from the bed without moving.

                                     TUDOR
                         Hello, darling. I feel wonderful. 
                         Come and sit beside me, beside me on 
                         the bed.

               Janine hesitates for a second, then walks to the bed and 
               sits down. She can now see that Tudor, although pale and 
               sickly, is smiling ecstatically. He puts an arm around Janine, 
               who reacts stiffly.

                                     TUDOR
                         Do you want to make love? You're 
                         absolutely beautiful, those eyes, 
                         that expression. You're absolutely 
                         the most sexy thing alive. Do you 
                         want to make love?

                                     JANINE
                              (slightly repulsed)
                         Nick, you're so strange...

               Tudor begins to unbutton his shirt with one hand, his other 
               still gripping Janine tightly.

                                     TUDOR
                         You will make love to me, won't you, 
                         Janine? Won't you make love to me? 
                         You start it. Won't you? I think 
                         I've forgotten how to start.

                                     JANINE
                              (now in tears)
                         Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.

                                     TUDOR
                         Please, Janine. Please, 
                         pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine 
                         JanineJanineJanine...

               Janine hesitantly helps Tudor remove his shirt and begins to 
               caress him in a perfunctory way, tears in her eyes. Her 
               caresses make Tudor moan with pleasure.

                                     TUDOR
                         Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so 
                         beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're 
                         my wife.

               Janine's hand sweeps across Tudor's abdomen. She pulls her 
               hand away, startled, obviously having just felt a few of 
               Tudor's lumps.

               She looks up at Tudor's face with a mixture of horror and 
               wonder in her eyes. Tudor is confused; he doesn't want the 
               caresses to stop.

                                     TUDOR
                              (pleading)
                         You're my wife, Janine. Please make 
                         love to me.

               INT. SPERGAZZI APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               The Spergazzi apartment is very heavily decorated in the 
               Mediterranean European Catholic style, featuring lots of 
               plastic and plaster Madonnas, calendars with Christ exposing 
               his bleeding heart, etc.

               Mrs. Spergazzi lies on an overstuffed couch with her wrist 
               held up for Forsythe to bandage after she coats it with a 
               healing gel. Mrs. Spergazzi wears a suffering-martyr 
               expression. Mr. Spergazzi leans over the back of the couch 
               patting his wife's other hand solicitously.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               The steel door at the top of a concrete flight of stairs 
               swings open and St. Luc appears. He quickly negotiates the 
               steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which leads to 
               the incinerator room.

               Once inside, St. Luc grabs the poker hanging from an iron 
               hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator, slides open the 
               bolt on the door and opens it.

               He begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven but 
               can't really see very much. He looks around and notices the 
               superintendent's flashlight stuck up on top of a heating 
               pipe. St. Luc takes down the flashlight, switches it on, and 
               continues his search for the dead parasite.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Tudor lies on top of Janine on their bed. Over his shoulder, 
               Janine's face is visible, eyes wide open and full of tears. 
               She tries to push Tudor away, but he resists.

                                     JANINE
                              (frantically)
                         No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's 
                         stop. I... I want to put my contacts 
                         in... I can't see anything...

               Tudor pulls her back to him, and finally she is forced to 
               batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of the 
               bed. Tudor glares after her.

                                     TUDOR
                              (in a mechanical whine)
                         Make love to me, make love to me, 
                         love, love to me...

                                     JANINE
                              (trying to buy time)
                         I want to be able to see us, Nick. 
                         I... I'm going to go into the bathroom 
                         now and put in my contacts, OK? Is 
                         that OK?
                              (pleading with him to 
                              believe her)
                         I want to be able to see us when we 
                         make love, OK?

               Tudor's eyes are staring right out of his head and his mouth 
               is wide open. He gasps for breath. He stares at Janine for a 
               second, then buries his face in the blankets, twisting them 
               in his hands and moaning.

               Janine bursts into tears and turns away from the bed, heading 
               for the bathroom.

               In the bathroom, Janine starts to shake, on the verge of 
               hysteria. Distractedly, she goes through the motions of 
               putting her contact lenses in: opens the medicine-cabinet 
               door, takes out the lens container, takes out the bottles of 
               wetting and soaking solutions, opens the lens container. 
               Suddenly, Tudor wails terribly, like a hound, from the 
               bedroom.

                                     TUDOR
                              (heart-rending wail)
                         Ooooooooooooooooo!

               Janine turns to the door, turns back to the lenses, dumps 
               both lenses out into her hand, begins to squirt solution on 
               them. She has decided to try to ignore Tudor.

                                     TUDOR
                              (wailing)
                         Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!

               Janine can no longer pretend that she doesn't hear him. 
               Closing her hand around the two lenses, she runs out of the 
               bathroom.

               Tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness. His lips 
               move silently, spasmically, as though in sleep, twitching in 
               an abnormal, insect fashion. There is a swelling in his 
               throat, almost as though he has developed a goiter, which 
               swells and contracts rhythmically.

               Janine appears in the doorway.

                                     JANINE
                              (a strangled half-
                              whisper)
                         I'm here, Nick. Janine is here.

               After a pause, she walks into the room.

               She climbs on to the bed and settles down. She puts her face 
               very close to Tudor's. For the moment, his face is 
               expressionless, but his neck is swollen just under the jaw.

               Janine sighs deeply, trying not to panic. Her eyes narrow 
               suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is 
               myopic -- as she notices something odd.

               There is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corner 
               of Tudor's mouth. Janine moves closer to it. The black thing, 
               like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches.

               Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudor's lip. As 
               her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside Tudor's 
               mouth.

               Janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists, 
               cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever 
               occupies Tudor's mouth.

               Gradually the thread reappears. Tudor's lips part slightly 
               to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which 
               the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- is 
               attached. The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way 
               from between Tudor's lips.

               Janine is paralyzed with horror.

               The tentacle is now touching Tudor's chin, his cheek, the 
               tip of his nose.

               Janine's fists tighten even more. A glassy snap breaks the 
               silence. Janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. In 
               the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are 
               incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the 
               lenses into her flesh until they snapped. The segmented lens 
               fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood.

               She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. She 
               eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first 
               stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. She moves 
               a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the 
               movement of the tentacles.

               The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudor's chin and 
               cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to 
               draw itself out of his body. His throat bulges, his cheeks 
               swell as the tentacles contract. His lips are gradually forced 
               apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. His mouth is 
               opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly exposes 
               itself to the dim light of the bedroom.

               Janine's eyes are wide with terror. She utters a gurgling 
               cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. She dashes through 
               the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, 
               whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the 
               doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Janine runs down a hallway that leads to Betts's apartment, 
               sobbing and stumbling. She gets to Betts's door and opens it 
               without hesitation.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Janine enters Betts' apartment. She looks around for Betts.

                                     JANINE
                         Betts? Betts? It's me.

               She catches sight of Betts standing out on the balcony, 
               looking across at the North Tower's lights. Betts turns 
               slowly. She is wearing immaculate but very extreme make-up. 
               Janine is slightly taken aback -- it's not Betts' style.

               Betts smiles and opens her arms to Janine.

               INT. ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo puts his jacket on, picks up his doctor's bag and a 
               manila envelope jammed solid with Hobbes's notes, and leaves 
               his lab, turning off the lights and locking the door behind 
               him.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF ROLLO'S LAB -- NIGHT

               Rollo gets into his car, which is parked in a now empty 
               parking lot adjacent to the building in which his lab is 
               situated. His car is large and American and ostentatious, a 
               gold Cadillac Eldorado with options or equivalent.

               The car pulls out of the lot and on to the street.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               The doorman, drooling and twitching, locks the exit doors at 
               the end of one hallway. In one hand he holds an enormous 
               pair of cable cutters.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with 
               the poker. Finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered 
               corpse of Spergazzi's parasite.

               Deftly manipulating the hook on the poker's tip, St. Luc 
               manages to pull the parasite out into the light. Garbage 
               comes rattling down the chute. When St. Luc flashes his light 
               into the oven, we see that the garbage consists of Betts' 
               French food, half-eaten, silver servers and all, the snails 
               being especially prominent. Insane giggles echo down the 
               chute, followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere 
               several floors above.

               St. Luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the 
               incinerator. The light seems to go right through the parasite, 
               illuminating the twisted vascular system, reproductive organs, 
               etc.

               As St. Luc examines the creature, which is still impaled on 
               the hook of the poker, the door to the incinerator room opens 
               behind him. A large, hairy, muscular man enters the room and 
               approaches the oblivious St. Luc.

               The man slips his arms up under St. Luc's arms and kisses 
               him passionately on the neck. As soon as St. Luc realizes 
               what's happening, he smashes the man in the chest with his 
               elbow and pulls free.

               The man grabs St. Luc again, trying to kiss him on the mouth. 
               They struggle. St. Luc is thrown to the concrete floor. The 
               man tries to pin him down. St. Luc, on the verge of being 
               overpowered, smashes the man in the chest with the poker, 
               parasite still hooked into its tip.

               The man stands up unsteadily. St. Luc cracks him on the ankle 
               with the poker and he comes crashing down. The parasite corpse 
               is flung across the room, where it smacks wetly into the 
               wall and slides to the floor.

               St. Luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the 
               head. After a furious moment or two, he suddenly stops, drops 
               the poker, and stares at the body in horrified disbelief.

               St. Luc slowly backs away from the man's body, which is very 
               still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor. 
               He bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man. The 
               collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat, and 
               he turns, himself scratched and bleeding, and staggers up 
               the basement steps.

               INT. SPERGAZZI'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Forsythe waits impatiently for St. Luc. Mr. Spergazzi is 
               watching a variety show on TV and Mrs. Spergazzi is making 
               ravioli in the kitchen, more or less recovered from her 
               encounter with the parasite.

               Suddenly a piercing scream is heard from down the hall. Mr. 
               Spergazzi, hard of hearing, doesn't notice. The scream is 
               followed by bangs, crashes, and insane laughter and giggling.

               Mrs. Spergazzi comes out of the kitchen. She has heard the 
               noises. She and Forsythe look at each other for a moment, 
               then Forsythe goes to the door and slides the chain lock 
               into place. She then goes to the telephone to call the police.

                                     FORSYTHE
                              (into receiver)
                         Hello? Hello?

               She dials a few times, and clicks the receiver button. 
               Nothing. The phone is dead. She puts the receiver back on 
               the hook. Mrs. Spergazzi knows that something is very wrong. 
               She wrings her hands and begins to wail in Italian.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               In the hallway outside the Spergazzi apartment, a group of 
               giggling, drooling residents stand around a door.

               One of these residents is the superintendent, who is opening 
               the door with one of his set of master keys. The residents, 
               some of them women, giggle in anticipation. Once the door 
               has been opened, they all rush in, drooling and moaning.

               From inside the apartment we hear several muffled voices, at 
               first angry and indignant, then pleading and terrified. 
               Screams and crashes follow.

               INT. SPERGAZZI APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Mrs. Spergazzi is getting hysterical; Mr. Spergazzi is trying 
               to calm her down by getting her to sit in front of the TV 
               set with him. But each time he pushes her down, she pops up 
               and begins wailing and moaning again.

               Forsythe paces back and forth, checks her watch, paces some 
               more. Finally, after a particularly noisy outburst by Mrs. 
               Spergazzi, Forsythe picks up the doctor's bag, unchains the 
               door, and leaves.

               Spergazzi hears the door slam and looks up.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Miss! Nurse! Come back! Cabiria, she 
                         needs something...!

               He lapses back into Italian, trying vainly to calm his wife 
               down.

               INT. BETTS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Betts and Janine are on the sofa, Janine with her head in 
               Betts's lap, Betts rocking Janine like a child.

                                     JANINE
                              (sobbing)
                         Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so 
                         hideous. Everything dies and rots 
                         and disappears. I'm going to die, 
                         and you're going to die, and Nick...

               She breaks down.

               Betts is drowsy-eyed and smiling. She strokes Janine's hair.

                                     BETTS
                         There, there, there. It all gets 
                         sorted out in the genes and 
                         chromosomes. It's not for us to think 
                         about at all. It's not our problem 
                         at all, 'Nine. We're just here to 
                         exist and to have a good time. Exist 
                         and have a good time.
                              (pause)
                         Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel 
                         good to you?

               Janine's eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks, 
               but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed.

                                     JANINE
                         Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You 
                         have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, 
                         I'm so skinny.

                                     BETTS
                              (casually, as though 
                              it were the most 
                              ordinary request in 
                              the world)
                         Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you 
                         to make love to me. Please, please 
                         make love to me.

               Janine twists around and looks up at Betts. There is something 
               in Betts' tone -- quite apart from what she is saying -- 
               that disturbs her, something that reminds her of her husband.

                                     JANINE
                         Betts! You can't really be saying 
                         that! You just can't!

               Betts smiles drowsily. She bends over Janine, turning her 
               head in her hands until they face each other. Betts lowers 
               her face toward Janine. Janine is wide-eyed, almost hypnotized 
               by Betts's strength, smile, and confidence.

                                     BETTS
                         Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall 
                         we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's 
                         kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 
                         'Nine?

               Janine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on 
               Janine's. After a pause, Betts suddenly opens her mouth wide 
               and presses her lips savagely against Janine's.

               She holds Janine's head firmly as they kiss. Janine struggles 
               for a moment, then opens her mouth as well.

               Her eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in 
               terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite 
               rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth. The parasite 
               begins to force its way into Janine's mouth and down her 
               throat. Janine gags and tries to pull away, but too late.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               Forsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator 
               and pulls open the steel door at the bottom. She begins to 
               look around for St. Luc.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Roger? Roger, are you here?

               She suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has 
               killed. She actually has to break her fall with her hands, 
               which slip in the man's blood. Horrified, she gets up and 
               backs away.

               The sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from 
               everywhere. Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. 
               She tugs on the handle and it opens.

               INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

               St. Luc has made his way to the main doors and stands talking 
               to the rental agent, Merrick, who is leaning against the 
               intercom board with the doorman's pocketbook romance in one 
               hand.

               The agent looks perfectly normal, though he keeps wiping his 
               mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand.

                                     MERRICK
                         ...haven't seen anything that looks 
                         like trouble at all. Just filling in 
                         for Walter... the doorman. But if 
                         you want me to call the police, I 
                         will.

               St. Luc is cautious but he seems to believe Merrick. He 
               presses the button which buzzes the Spergazzi apartment. 
               Nobody answers. A middle-aged man walks in. Worried, St. Luc 
               buzzes again.

                                     MAN
                         Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.

               Merrick smiles and opens the door for the man, who goes in 
               and takes the stairway up, preferring to walk.

               The intercom squawks and Spergazzi answers the buzzer.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI
                         Yes? Who is there?

                                     ST. LUC
                         It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let 
                         me speak to the nurse, please.

                                     MR. SPERGAZZI (V.O.)
                         Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I 
                         think she must go to look for you.

               St. Luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the 
               door. Merrick smiles and pulls it open for him. St. Luc 
               disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator.

               As the stairway doors close, the elevators slide open and a 
               young couple come out heading for the main doors, dressed to 
               go out to a late party.

               Before they reach the doors, Merrick slips through them and 
               meets the couple in the lobby. He smiles broadly as he 
               approaches them.

                                     MERRICK
                         Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I 
                         wonder if I could talk to you for a 
                         second in my office?

                                     MISS LEWIS
                         Why don't you do something about all 
                         that noise? We like parties, but 
                         this is ridiculous.

                                     MERRICK
                         Well, there may be a connection. 
                         See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid 
                         somebody busted into it tonight.

                                     MISS LEWIS AND MR WOLF
                              (together)
                         Oh, no! What a drag!

                                     MERRICK
                         'Fraid so. I've got a few of the 
                         things they threw around in my office 
                         and if you could identify it...

               The couple turn, grumbling, and walk toward Merrick's office. 
               Merrick follows, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.

               INT. RENTAL OFFICE -- NIGHT

               The young couple enter the rental office, Merrick following 
               close behind. Once they are all in, Merrick closes the door. 
               He rests against the door and drools copiously, then giggles.

               The young couple turn to look at him. Suddenly, three more 
               residents, two women and a man, all of them half naked, jump 
               down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets. The 
               residents begin to kiss and paw the couple. Merrick wipes 
               his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself 
               on top of the writhing mass.

               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

               Finding herself in the underground garage, Forsythe decides 
               to get in her car and drive out. She finds her car -- a Datsun 
               or Toyota -- gets in, throws the doctor's bag in the back, 
               and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors.

               The car rolls over the cable which normally activates the 
               doors, but nothing happens. Forsythe puts the car in reverse 
               and backs over the cable, but still nothing happens. She 
               sits with the car idling, trying to figure out what to do 
               next.

               Suddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the 
               doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her.

               The doorman forces her down across the front seats of the 
               car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes 
               to shreds. He gradually forces himself between her legs.

               INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT

               St. Luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for 
               Forsythe. He sees immediately that she is not there, but 
               also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the 
               garage.

               He opens the garage door. Forsythe's screams come echoing 
               through the garage.

               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

               St. Luc races through the garage, trying to find Forsythe. 
               He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and 
               runs over to it.

               The doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front seat of 
               the car. St. Luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster 
               and begins smashing away at the doorman with it.

               The doorman pounds St. Luc in the temple with his fist and 
               lifts himself partially off Forsythe, half turning toward 
               St. Luc, who is staggered by the blow.

               The doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. Repulsed 
               and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper 
               body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might 
               hit Forsythe. The doorman slumps over Forsythe.

               St. Luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. He pulls 
               the doorman off Forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. 
               She has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is 
               nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman.

               St. Luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she 
               slumps, dazed. He doesn't have to start the car -- it's never 
               been turned off. He slams the shift lever into reverse and 
               backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. He puts 
               it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, 
               toward the garage door.

               Another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of 
               the door and screeches to a halt, blocking St. Luc, who in 
               swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete 
               post. He picks up the gun from the console between the seats 
               and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, 
               who are emerging from their car.

               One of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the 
               other two.

               St. Luc drags Forsythe out of the car, throws her over his 
               shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door 
               leading to the incinerator.

               INT. HALLWAYS -- NIGHT

               St. Luc half drags, half carries Forsythe along hallways 
               whose doors are wide open. From the apartments issues the 
               entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds -- giggles, 
               moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks.

               We catch glimpses of people of all kinds and ages locked 
               together on floors, chairs, etc. St. Luc finds an open exit 
               door and plunges through it, taking Forsythe with him.

               INT. GYM -- NIGHT

               The door to the gym opens and St. Luc looks in cautiously. 
               The gym is quite tiny and is deserted. St. Luc pulls Forsythe 
               in and closes the door. He lays Forsythe down on a gym mat 
               and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight-
               lifting table.

               He kneels beside Forsythe, who seems to be only just regaining 
               consciousness. St. Luc strokes her face, pushes strands of 
               hair matted with blood out of her eyes.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (more to himself than 
                              Forsythe)
                         Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be 
                         here soon.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

               Rollo's car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a 
               blatantly illegal space. He flips up a card on the dash which 
               says 'M.D. ON CALL,' then gets out of the car.

               He walks up the steps and through the main doors, which are 
               wide open. Nobody is in sight.

               INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Rollo walks along the hallway, bag in hand, envelope under 
               arm. He stops in front of Tudor's door, checks the number 
               against the number written in his notebook, then knocks on 
               the door.

               Nobody answers. He knocks once more, then looks around 
               shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in.

               INT. TUDOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Rollo enters and closes the door behind him, deliberately 
               slamming it. He walks into the center of the living room and 
               bellows.

                                     ROLLO
                         Hello, good evening, is anybody here? 
                         Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to 
                         see you for consultation.

               Still no answer. Rollo is puzzled. He snoops around the 
               apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half 
               closed. He pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually.

                                     ROLLO
                         It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?

               Rollo can now see the figure of Tudor lying in bed in the 
               dim light of the bedroom. Rollo enters the bedroom.

                                     ROLLO
                         Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr. 
                         Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here. 
                         He must be a little bit late.

               Tudor does not answer, does not move. He lies stiffly on the 
               bed on his back, mouth insanely agape, eyes shut, covers 
               half on the floor.

                                     ROLLO
                         Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is 
                         that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a 
                         look at you?

               He stands at the edge of the bed, peering at Tudor, looking 
               for signs of consciousness. After a pause, he kneels on the 
               bed and slowly draws back the covers.

                                     ROLLO
                         Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't 
                         hurt.

               Tudor's abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn 
               back. Crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged 
               blood parasites, which sits poised for only a fraction of a 
               second before it springs at Rollo's face with great energy.

               As the thing hits Rollo's face it locks on to his head by 
               entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching 
               its suckers to his cheeks and chin.

               Rollo tries to stand, then staggers and falls. The thing 
               tries to force its way into Rollo's mouth, cutting his lips 
               in the process. They bleed furiously. When Rollo manages to 
               pull a sucker away, a piece of his flesh comes with it.

               As he writhes on the carpeted floor, two more parasites appear 
               crawling toward him from under the bed, covered with dust 
               from the floor. They clamber on to him and fasten on to his 
               face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids. 
               One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face. 
               Rollo screams in pain.

               He manages to roll to his feet. He staggers out of the 
               darkness of the bedroom into the living room, one arm 
               extended, groping like a blind man, the three parasites still 
               locked on to his face. They try to pull his lips apart, but 
               he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing 
               their way into the depths of his body.

               He takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen. With a 
               sudden spasm of pain, he hurls himself sideways into the 
               kitchen and almost falls again, grabbing at the last moment 
               on to the sink.

               His hands touch a large pair of pliers, a screwdriver, and a 
               hammer on the counter by the sink, left there by Tudor weeks 
               ago. Rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites 
               from his face with their steel jaws. The parasites, swollen 
               with Tudor's blood, burst and spurt as the pliers tear them 
               apart.

               In the bedroom, Tudor's eyes snap open. His head rises from 
               the pillow.

               He swings his legs over the side of the bed and, ashen and 
               gaunt, shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream. 
               He begins to mumble.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't. 
                         You mustn't kill them, no, no, no.

               Then, as though listening to himself and suddenly 
               understanding what he is saying, he rises to his feet shakily 
               and walks to the kitchen. He stops at the kitchen door.

               Rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding 
               away at them in the kitchen sink. The parasites wriggle and 
               curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at 
               them with the pliers.

               Tudor staggers toward Rollo.

                                     TUDOR
                         No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's 
                         my blood you're spilling! My blood! 
                         Let them come home, let them come 
                         home, home, home inside me. Don't 
                         kill them...!

               He starts to paw Rollo, feebly trying to prevent him from 
               further mutilating the parasites. He reaches over St. Luc's 
               shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites.

                                     TUDOR
                              (whining pitifully)
                         At least save me one! For God's sake! 
                         At least save me one. One, one, one, 
                         one...

               Rollo turns as Tudor begins to shove the piece of flesh back 
               down his throat.

               As Rollo turns we see that bits of tentacles and suckers are 
               still attached to his cheeks, throat, forehead. His face is 
               melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the 
               corrosive fluid on one side. He stares in rage at Tudor.

               With a scream, Rollo strikes Tudor with the pliers. Tudor 
               falls, hitting his head on various chairs and protruding 
               corners as he goes down, the chunk of parasite still in his 
               mouth as he finally comes to rest, twitching, on the floor. 
               Rollo drops the pliers on the floor.

               He stares at Tudor in shock. His face is reflected in a copper 
               frying pan hanging over the stove. Noticing the reflection, 
               Rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image. He 
               gingerly touches his face, inspecting the damage, shivering 
               and moaning.

               Still shaking, he turns to leave.

               Without warning, Tudor leaps up at Rollo with insane energy 
               and bowls him over, pliers in hand. Sitting on Rollo's chest, 
               Tudor smashes away at Rollo's face and head with the pliers, 
               the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to Rollo's 
               face as he drools.

               INT. GYM -- NIGHT

               Forsythe finally opens her eyes. She smiles at St. Luc, who 
               hovers anxiously over her as she lies on the gym mat.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Can you walk? I couldn't find anything 
                         wrong with you.

               Forsythe nods and manages to sit up with St. Luc's help. 
               Once she seems able to stay propped up without St. Luc's 
               help, he gets up and begins to move the barricade away from 
               the door.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Rollo and the police should be here 
                         by now. It's just a question of 
                         avoiding infected residents until we 
                         find them.

               St. Luc comes back to Forsythe and kneels beside her.

                                     ST.LUC
                         OK? Ready to go?

               Forsythe puts her arm around St. Luc's neck as though wanting 
               support. Instead, she draws him down toward her and begins 
               to babble in a strange, casual, dreamy way.

                                     FORSYTHE
                         Sometimes I have a recurrent dream. 
                         Have I ever told you about it, 
                         darling? I guess you could call it a 
                         Freudian dream, because in this dream 
                         I find myself making love to Sigmund 
                         Freud. But I'm having trouble because 
                         he's old and dying, and he smells 
                         bad and I find him repulsive. And 
                         then he tells me that everything is 
                         erotic, everything is sexual, you 
                         know what I mean? He has a very thick 
                         accent, but I can understand him 
                         perfectly. He tells me that even old 
                         flesh is erotic flesh, that disease 
                         is the love of two alien kinds of 
                         creatures for each other, that dying 
                         is an act of eroticism, that even 
                         chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy 
                         and longing. That breathing is sexual, 
                         that talking is sexual, that just to 
                         physically exist is sexual... And I 
                         believe him, and we make love 
                         beautifully...

               While she talks, Forsythe gradually slips her arms around 
               St. Luc's neck and brings her lips closer and closer to his.

               St. Luc, mesmerized by the hypnotic drone of her words, is 
               about to kiss her. Suddenly her mouth snaps open wide with 
               mechanical precision, her head tilts back, her eyes flick 
               closed.

               St. Luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to swell.

               In the depths of Forsythe's mouth two parasite tentacles 
               probe about, seeking a firm hold for their suckers so that 
               they can pull the parasite's body out of her narrow esophagus.

               St. Luc hesitates only for an instant, then rips a strip 
               from her blouse, balls it up, and shoves it into her mouth. 
               Holding her while she struggles to remove it, he rips off a 
               second strip and ties it around her head to keep the gag in. 
               St. Luc rises, throws Forsythe over his shoulder and begins 
               to step toward the door of the gym.

               Dangling over St. Luc's shoulder, Forsythe struggles, moans, 
               and howls as best she can. St. Luc manages to pin her hands 
               to her sides so that she can't pull the gag out.

               Before St. Luc reaches the door, a handsome middle-aged woman 
               peeks in around the corner.

                                     WOMAN
                              (crooning in reply to 
                              Forsythe's howl)
                         Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone 
                         here who's all alooooooooone?

               St. Luc rushes at the woman, knocking her over. She rolls on 
               the floor, hugging herself and crooning.

               Once out the door, St. Luc makes for the nearest exit.

               INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

               As St. Luc begins to ascend the stairs, we can see tiny black 
               hooks tearing through Forsythe's gag. Blood begins to soak 
               through from the inside.

               A group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing 
               above St. Luc and, noticing them, begin to walk down the 
               steps, moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures 
               toward the pair.

               Blood is now pouring from Forsythe's mouth and tentacles are 
               groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin.

               St. Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, 
               certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main doors.

               As he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss 
               him, caress him, pull his clothes off. They finally manage 
               to drag Forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him 
               as they do so. St. Luc tries to prop her up on her feet, but 
               she's completely limp. St. Luc holds Forsythe against the 
               stairway wall as residents mill all about them. He looks at 
               her in sudden hopelessness.

                                     ST. LUC
                              (shouting)
                         Forsythe! Forsythe!

               The parasite is now half out of her mouth, hanging through 
               the slit it has torn in her gag.

               St. Luc lets go of Forsythe and she sinks to the floor. The 
               residents are swarming all over them. St. Luc abandons 
               Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs.

               He runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, 
               until he is free of the slow-moving residents. He leans back 
               against a wall, panting.

               Crooning and moaning echo up to him from below. He leans 
               over the railing and looks down.

               In the stairwell several flights below, Forsythe lies 
               surrounded by milling residents, legs spread as though about 
               to give birth. A resident leans over and pulls the parasite 
               from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. Other 
               residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though 
               offering her a strange kind of comfort.

               St. Luc reels with disgust and disbelief. He turns and runs.

               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- NIGHT

               Between the two towers lies the swimming pool. St. Luc manages 
               to reach the door leading from the South Tower into the pool. 
               He hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in 
               near exhaustion, then opens it and enters.

               The pool is dim and tranquil. Two women are swimming in the 
               deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal.

               St. Luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent 
               normalcy of the scene. Then he staggers forward, calling out 
               to the swimmers.

                                     ST. LUC
                         Have you seen the police? I'm Dr. 
                         St. Luc. Have you seen the police? 
                         Have they come?

               The swimmers both flick playfully beneath the water's surface. 
               St. Luc approaches the water's edge, waiting for them to 
               surface. The water ripples and bubbles near his feet. A 
               sinking feeling comes over him. He watches in horrible 
               fascination. He begins to shiver.

               The ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. After a pause, 
               Janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. A few seconds later, 
               Betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery 
               calm. Betts gestures to St. Luc to join them in the pool.

               St. Luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool.

               He turns to leave the room. As he turns, Mr. Spergazzi appears 
               out of the shadows behind him. Using his four-pronged aluminum 
               cane, he pushes St. Luc backwards into the pool, chuckling 
               playfully.

               Spergazzi looks around for approval as St. Luc begins to 
               thrash about wildly.

               Betts swims up beside St. Luc, grabs him, and holds him under.

                                     BETTS
                              (to Janine)
                         A kiss!
                              (laughter echoes in 
                              the pool room)
                         Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.

                                     VARIOUS RESIDENTS
                              (voices echoing in 
                              unison)
                         A kiss, a kiss, a kiss!

               Betts allows St. Luc to rise to the surface as a laughing 
               Janine splashes over to him and fastens her mouth to his.

               As they kiss, Janine's hands hold St. Luc's head fiercely. 
               Betts assists her by pinning St. Luc's arms behind him. 
               Janine's throat ripples and swells, her cheeks billow as a 
               parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body. St. Luc's 
               cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth. His eyes 
               jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, 
               revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like 
               grappling irons.

               St. Luc twists out of Betts' grasp. He and Janine, still 
               locked together, sink beneath the surface.

               Dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join Spergazzi 
               and the others at the poolside. Among these are faces already 
               familiar to us: Kurt, Kresimir and Benda, the old laundry-
               room woman, etc.

               The new spectators clap, laugh, croon, and moan as though 
               witnessing a wild group baptism. Some of them throw themselves 
               into the water, pulling others in with them.

               Deep under the water's surface, St. Luc still struggles to 
               free himself from Janine. Residents now splash into the depths 
               all around them.

               St. Luc's cheeks bulge wide and blood dribbles from his nose 
               and mouth. His throat swells monstrously. Janine releases 
               him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip 
               back into his mouth. He exhales heavily as parasite enzymes 
               pump furiously through his body. The water boils with his 
               exhaled breath.

               Janine and St. Luc drift apart, now completely calm, as 
               residents splash and swim, kick and embrace.

               INT. STARLINER TOWERS UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- NIGHT

               The vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars. 
               Somewhere an engine starts up, then another and another, 
               until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving of 
               engines.

               As we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the residents 
               we already know, now dressed to the teeth in their seductive 
               best.

               Mr. Spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the spectacle, 
               canes in hand, with great dignity. With them stand others 
               who are too old or too young to go into the night looking 
               for new hosts for their parasites, content to remain 
               incubators for the time being.

               The residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their cars. 
               Kresimir leans out of his car and shouts to no one in 
               particular.

                                     KRESIMIR
                              (shouting)
                         Nobody should be alone! Nobody should 
                         be alone tonight!

               The rest of the residents pick up the cry and chant together.

                                     RESIDENTS
                              (together)
                         Nobody alone! Nobody alone!

               The night watchman stands near the garage doors. Smiling 
               broadly, he stamps on the cable which activates the sliding 
               doors.

               EXT. STARLINER TOWERS -- NIGHT

               The garage doors slide open. One car surges up the ramp ahead 
               of all the others, stopping at the top.

               The driver of this first car is St. Luc, sleek and exuberant, 
               a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars. He 
               glances into his rear-view mirror.

               In the rear-view mirror, St. Luc sees all the other cars 
               lining up behind him, lights blazing.

               St. Luc smiles, then steps on the accelerator. His car shoots 
               out into the street.

               As St. Luc's car turns on to the street, car after car follows 
               him. We rise higher and higher above the Starliner Towers 
               apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of lights 
               far below, bleeding into the main body of the neon-lit 
               metropolis.

                                         THE END
"SIGNS"

FADE IN:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The
backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. 
Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A
CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
COMING FROM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard
something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE
REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and
white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
bedroom door.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING

Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings
taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He
puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
bedroom.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR
THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's
ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.

The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the
doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very
still.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his
children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. 
Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both
empty.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.

MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. 
Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His
muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and
looks around bewildered.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.

                    MERRILL
          Where are they?

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

                    CHILDREN
              (yelling in the distance)
          Daaaad!

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - MORNING

The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. 
Her hair is messed from sleep.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo where's Morgan?

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo?

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

                    BO
          Are you in my dreams too?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          This isn't a --

                    BOY (O.S.)
          Dad!

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's
close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan what's happening?

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.

                    GRAHAM
          Are... you... hurt?

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

                    MORGAN
          I think God did it.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

                    GRAHAM
          Did what Morgan?

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham
sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving
forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. 
They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.

WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          ... Lee actually the reason I'm
          calling is about Lionel.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Was he at home last night with you
          or was he out and about with the
          Wolfington brothers?

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Well, there was a little mischief
          done to our crops last night.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          I know he's a fine boy... No one's
          saying otherwise.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

KITCHEN.

Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
VOICE.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
          was him.  You could just talk to
          him and that would be enough for
          me... See it was kind of strange
          finding the crops like that.  The
          kids were... confused by it.  It
          would take the strangeness away if
          we knew it was Lionel and the
          Wolfington brothers just messing
          around...
              (beat, listens)
          The movies...
              (beat)
          Are you sure?
              (beat)
          Okay, then... Thank you for your
          patience Lee.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

                    GRAHAM
          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.
          Reynolds.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down
the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.

                    GRAHAM
          That was quick Edgar.  I only
          called you boys about two hours
          ago.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
          she put it, "diving for her life"
          when a bunch of school kids rode
          down the sidewalk on skateboards. 
          She went down to Thorton's store
          this morning and started spitting
          on the new skateboards.  Spitting! 
          By the time I got there, Mrs.
          Kindleman had sprayed the whole
          damn place... She must have had a
          cold or something.  It was enough
          to turn a grown man's stomach.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          So what happened to your crops?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME

Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. 
She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

                    BO
          I think it's contaminated.

                    MORGAN
          You don't even know what that word
          means.

He drinks.

                    MORGAN
          It's not contaminated.  It's just
          tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

                    BO
          It tastes funny.

                    MORGAN
          He licks his butt everyday.  He's
          not going to mind.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He
doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

HOUDINI MOVES...

BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...

HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

BEAT.  The children turn white.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini?

HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up.

                    MORGAN
          Bo don't run.

Houdini crouches down.

                    MORGAN
          What's wrong boy?

THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.

                    MORGAN
          Stop it Houdini!

The German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about
to leap.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Bo, run.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away. 
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat.

The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat. 
Officer Paski yells over the wind.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          It's the strangest thing Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          What's that?

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.  It's just
          Graham now.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          Sorry.

They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each
other.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You said something was strange. 
          What's strange?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          The footprints.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          What about them?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          There are none.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a
single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (soft)
          Look at where it's bent over.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

                    GRAHAM
          It's not broken.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What kind of machine can bend a
          stalk of corn over without cracking
          it?

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn
stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.

                    GRAHAM
              (softy)
          Can't be by hand... It's too
          perfect.

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Doesn't sound much like Lionel
          Prichard and the Wolfington
          brothers.  They can't take a piss
          without wetting the front of their
          pants.

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Second thing this week I can't
          explain.

                    GRAHAM
          What was the first thing?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Some animals around the county
          exhibiting uncharacteristic
          behavior.  Sometimes violent
          behavior.  Theo Henry had two of
          his fingers bit off by his cow.

                    GRAHAM
          Sounds like a virus.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. 
          Like they act when they smell a
          predator around... Peeing on
          themselves and everything.

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the
roof over the crops.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Edgar, please don't call me Father.

The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them. 
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What's wrong?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't hear my children.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they
look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.

Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma
spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          He wanted to kill Bo.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

                    GRAHAM
          Did he hurt you?

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him
up in his arms.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers in his ear)
          I'm so sorry Morgan.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her
face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.

                    MERRILL
          I used a little Tabasco in the
          potato salad.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

                    BO
          Houdini's sick.

                    GRAHAM
          Please tie up Isabelle to the back
          of the shed.  Make sure the knot's
          tight.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He
nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as
he lies by himself.

                    GRAHAM
          They're tough cookies, those two. 
          They think Houdini's playing with
          you up there.
              (beat)
          At least it got them to sleep.

Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little.

                    GRAHAM
          Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one
          for you... What can make geometric
          shapes the size of a football
          field... and what would scare every
          animal in this county?
              (beat)
          Have you figured it out yet?
              (smiles)
          You probably have...
              (beat)
          Give me a hint Colleen... Is it
          bigger than a bread box?

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight.

A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND.

THEY SUDDENLY STOP.

AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His
daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is
five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                    BO
          I saw a monster.  Can I have a
          glass of water?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What's wrong with the water next to
          your bed?

                    BO
          It tastes old.

Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's
hand and starts out of the room.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the rule about getting up in
          the middle of the night?

                    BO
          Only for pee or poop.

                    GRAHAM
          Right.

Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened
hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him
back onto the pillow and covers him up.

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham
moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares
back at him as she holds her panda.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What are you thinking about?

                    BO
              (soft)
          Why do you talk to mom when you're
          by yourself?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It makes me feel better.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Does she ever answer back?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          No.

                    BO
              (soft)
          She doesn't answer me either.

Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment.

Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE
SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND
STARES AT HIM.

THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S
BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF.

Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Get under a blanket.  They can't
          get you under the blankets.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

GREY SNOW FILLS THE SCREEN.  Merrill sleeps in front of the
family room television.

A hand gently shakes him.  Merrill wakes and looks up at his
brother zipping up his overcoat.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.

                    MERRILL
          Okay, this guy is trying to scare
          us.  He's messed with our property,
          he's coming around the house.  It's
          time for an ass whoopin'!

                    GRAHAM
          This is not an intelligent way to
          approach this.

Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside. 
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          We both go outside and move around
          the house in opposite directions. 
          We act crazy, insane with anger. 
          Make him crap in his pants and
          force him around till we meet up on
          the other side.

Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain, act crazy?

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Curse and stuff.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          I'm not going to curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You don't mean it.  It's just for
          show.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          It doesn't sound natural when I
          curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Just make noises then.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain noises.

                    MERRILL

          Are you going to do this or what?

          No I'm not.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You want him coming in the house
          next time?

Beat.

They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into
the darkness.

                    MERRILL
              (hushed tone)
          On the count of three.

          One... two... three.

Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite

Merrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the

          Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger.

Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead
of him.

                    GRAHAM
          I've lost my mind!  It's time for
          an ass whoopin'!

Merrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME

INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL.

                    MERRILL
          I'm gonna tear your head off!

Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS
AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER.

Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come
to a stop facing each other.  Beat.

They look around, panting heavily.

          I cursed.

                    MERRILL
          I heard.

Graham's eyes drift above them.

                    GRAHAM
          He's on the roof.

They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves
in the backyard.

Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just
catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the
crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being
hit.

They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR
HEAVY BREATHING.

                    MERRILL (V.O.)
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM (V.O.)
          Yes it was.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad
open.  He faces Graham and Merrill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You can't describe him at all? 
          Don't you think that's find of odd?

                    GRAHAM
          It does seem kind of odd doesn't
          it?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know whether to look for a
          midget or a --

                    GRAHAM
          He definitely wasn't a midget.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Okay.
              (beat)
          So he was tall?

                    GRAHAM
              (to Merrill)
          I would say so.

                    MERRILL
          Probably.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Over six feet?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM
          Yes, it was.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          We've established that.
              (beat)
          Just tell me about his clothing
          then.

Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
          jeans?

They keep staring.  Edgar closes his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Let me ask you two something. 
          Don't be embarrassed by the answer. 
          It is possible... Just possible
          now, you might have been chasing
          each other around?  You said you
          went in opposite directions.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
          saying it, as it is to you hearing
          it.  But we couldn't see him.  He
          stayed mostly in the shadows.  All
          we could make out was movement.
              (beat)
          But I'll tell you something with
          absolute certainty.  There was
          someone watching our house last
          night.  He was looking in my
          children's windows and I want you
          to find him Edgar.
              (beat)
          I need you to take this seriously,
          just incase, it is something
          serious.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I apologize.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby
monitor.

                    MORGAN
          Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
          a walkie-talkie?

                    GRAHAM
          Yes.

                    MORGAN
          It needs batteries.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, come inside.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.

Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down
on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

KITCHEN.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          How certain are you, that this was
          a male?

                    MERRILL
          I don't know any girls can run like
          that.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          These are D's; I need double A's.

                    GRAHAM
          I have some upstairs.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know Merrill.  I've seen
          some of those women on the
          Olympics.  They could out run me
          easy.

They all move into the

FAMILY ROOM.

Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.

                    MERRILL
          This guy got on the roof in like a
          second.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, can you turn down the volume
          until Officer Paski leaves?

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow
Graham up the

STAIRS.

                    MERRILL
          That roof is over ten feet high.

                    GRAHAM
          He's telling you the truth, Edgar. 
          Whoever it was, is very strong and
          can jump pretty high.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.  He moves into his

BATHROOM.

They all move in with him.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          They got women's high jumping in
          the Olympics.  They got these
          Scandinavian women who could jump
          clean over me.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open
the back.

                    GRAHAM
          Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I
          have double A's in here.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.

                    GRAHAM
          I know you're making a point Edgar. 
          I just don't know what it is.

They moves down the STAIRS.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
          woman stopped by the diner and
          started yelling and cussing cause
          they didn't have her favorite
          cigarettes at the vending machine. 
          Scared a couple of customers.  No
          one's seen her since... My point
          is, we don't know anything about
          the person you saw.  We should just
          keep all possibilities available.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

                    BO
          Dad, where's the remote?

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops
with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over
to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands
next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, you're too old to still be
          doing this.  The rule is, you take
          a glass of water, you finish it.
              (beat)
          Now what's wrong with this one?

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.  Looks at the glass.

                    BO
          There's dust in it.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          A hair.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          Morgan took a sip.  It has his
          amoebas in it.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads
towards the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Excluding the possibility that a
          female Scandinavian Olympian was
          running around outside our house
          last night, what else is a
          possibility?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'm not done asking questions and I
          don't appreciate the sarcasm.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you have anyone who might have a
          grudge or something against you? 
          Maybe a church member, who might
          not have liked the fact, that you
          left the church?

Graham looks at Edgar.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't think so.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you owe anybody money?  You can
          tell me off the record if you need
          too.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
          No.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Is anything missing?

                    GRAHAM
          No.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A
STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.

                    MORGAN
          It's still making the noises.  It's
          broken.

                    GRAHAM
          It's old Morgan.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Listen, I was out of line with that
          whole female Scandinavian Olympian
          thing.

Edgar nods.

                    MERRILL
          It's just that, I'm pretty strong
          and pretty fast.  And I was running
          as fast as I could.  And this
          guy...
              (embarrassed smile)
          He was just toying with us.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches
Edgar think it over.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. 
He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He
gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Could everyone just take a seat on
          the couch.  I have some preliminary
          thoughts.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          There are three possibilities here. 
          We'll call them one, two and three. 
          The level one scenario is that
          there is a sane individual, who for
          real reasons wants to do you harm. 
          I really don't believe that's what
          we're looking at here.  In my
          opinion, whoever this is, they
          don't want to do harm to you all. 
          That's kind of clear.
              (beat)
          The level two scenario is, this is
          a mentally unstable person who's
          fixated on you and your family. 
          This is a possibility, but a very
          slim one.
              (beat)
          I assure you I will treat all three
          possibilities carefully, but in all
          likely hood we are looking at what
          we'll call a level three scenario. 
          He's a watcher.  Someone who this
          is a game for.  He's laying low. 
          Doesn't want to be seen.  But he
          wants to watch you.  Study you
          folks.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and
Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next
to the television.

ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE
IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.

Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Now I don't want you all to worry
          about this no more.  You're making
          more of this than it is.
              (beat)
          You guys have had a tough couple of
          days with the vandalism to the
          crops and the death of your
          shepherd.
              (beat)
          Maybe you guys should do something
          fun?  Let me worry about this
          person.  Let me find out who it is
          and then -- What the hell are you
          people looking at?

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.

A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE
FIELD.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'll be damned.

                    GRAHAM
          Turn up the volume Bo.

Bo gets up.

                    BO
          I can't find the remote.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

                    TV ANCHOR
          -- images were shot yesterday
          afternoon by a thirty-four year old
          local camera man in Kerala, a
          southern city of India.  It is the
          eighteenth reported crop circle
          found in that country in the last
          seventy-two hours.

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

                    PROFESSOR (TV)
          Crop circles first emerged in the
          late seventies with the renewed
          interest in extraterrestrial life. 
          They died out by the early
          eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. 
          This new resurgence is wholly
          different.  Elements of it are
          unexplainable.  The speed and the
          quantity in which it has appeared
          implies the coordination of
          hundreds of individuals over many
          countries...
              (beat)
          There is only a limited amount of
          explanations.  Either this is one
          of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
          created, or basically...
              (beat)
          It's for real.

Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes
in deeply.

                    MORGAN
              (wonder)
          Extraterrestrials.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What in God's name is going on?

Beat.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the
television screen.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY

The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I
          can't think straight right now. 
          I'm going back to the station. 
          Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
          try to think clear.  After that I
          might make some calls.
              (beat)
          Hoaxes... People got way too much
          time on their hands.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          But I'll tell you something, what I
          said in their, still goes.  You and
          your family have been through a lot
          in the last two days... Not to
          mention what happened to you all
          seven months ago.

                    GRAHAM
          Six months.

Edgar stares at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          And three weeks.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          It's left its mark still.  The last
          thing these children need to do, is
          worry about some crazy things
          happening in the world.  Take them
          into town.  Get their minds -- your
          mind, on everyday things.  It's
          good medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          It's good advice...
              (beat)
          Say hi to Marcia for me.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You take care of yourself...
              (beat)
          Graham.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL
PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS. 
WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS.

The Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives. 
Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back.

Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... signs intended to be seen from
          the sky --

CLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF.

                    GRAHAM
          No radio either... Just for a
          while.

Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON

Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet
street.

The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking
meter.

Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill
puts change in the meter.

Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.

                    MORGAN
          Book money.

Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he
reaches into his back pocket.

                    GRAHAM
          Only one.

Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
and walks down the sidewalk.

Graham watches them turn into a store.

Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he
walks away.

Graham turns and calls after him.

                    GRAHAM
              (calls out)
          Meet back in fifteen minutes.

Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking.

Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS.
NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their
counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE
TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES
SURROUND A CIRCLE.

Morgan steps up to the counter.

                    MORGAN
          Extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          That's what they keep alluding to. 
          It's just a bunch of crock. 
          They're trying to sell sodas, plain
          and simple.  I've been watching
          these reports since morning.  I've
          seen twelve soda commercials so
          far.  Twelve!

                    MORGAN
          Do you have book on
          extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          Don't tell me you believe this
          horse manure?

Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          As a matter of fact, I think we
          have one.  Came by mistake in a
          shipment.  Decided to keep it for
          city people.

Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Last row.  Third book from the left
          honey.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham waits at a white counter.  A gum chewing PHARMACIST in
her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,
glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to
the radio.

                    RADIO HOST (V.O.)
          Why is no one saying the obvious? 
          This is just a rash case of
          copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does
          the first one.  It's on TV, it's on
          the internet.  In less than an hour
          a couple hundred people get the
          same brilliant idea and here we
          are... on the verge of mass
          hysteria.

                    PHARMACIST
          It was asthma medicine right
          Father?

                    GRAHAM
          For Morgan Hess.  And it's not
          Father anymore.

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on
the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with
the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I ask you a favor Father?

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I take confession with you?

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
          reverend -- anymore.  I haven't
          been for six months.  You know
          this.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

                    TRACEY
          All this stuff on TV...
              (beat)
          Joe Gills was in here talking about
          the end of the world... I'm just a
          little scared.
              (beat)
          Please.  I need to take confession
          with you.

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales
slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small
storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
out some forms.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I got it figured.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

                    MERRILL
          You do?

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I've had two separate folks tell me
          they think there are strangers
          around these parts the last couple
          of nights.  Can't tell what they
          look like, cause they're staying in
          the shadows -- covert like.  No
          one's got hurt mind you... And
          that's the give away.

                    MERRILL
              (doesn't see)
          I see.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          It's called probing.  It's a
          military procedure.  You send a
          reconnaissance group, very small,
          to check out things.  Not to
          engage, but to evaluate the
          situation.  Evaluate the level of
          danger.  Make sure things are all
          clear...

                    MERRILL
          Clear for what?

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          ... For the rest of them.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy
smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

                    MERRILL
          You have a pamphlet or something I
          can read?

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the
top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Hey you didn't used to play
          baseball did you?

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill
          Hess.  I was there that day you hit
          that five hundred and eighty seven
          footer over the left field wall and
          set the record.  That thing had a
          motor on it... It's still the
          record right?

Merrill not, "yes."

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          I got the bat at home... On the
          wall.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You got two minor league home run
          records don't you?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Five.  The five longest.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Boy, why aren't you in the pros
          making stacks of cash and getting
          handfuls of T and A?

                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
          Cause he also has the minor league
          strike out record.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
the folding table.

                    MERRILL
          Hello Lionel.

LIONEL smirks.

                    LIONEL
          He'd just swing as hard as he could
          every time.  It didn't matter what
          the coach said, didn't matter who
          was on base, he'd whip that bat
          through the air as hard as he
          could... Looked like a lumber jack
          chopping down a tree.
              (beat)
          Merrill here, struck out more times
          than any two players.

Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You really hold the strike out
          record?

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like
he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are
soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

                    MERRILL
          Felt wrong not to swing.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and
starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches
and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

                    PHARMACIST
          I cursed thirty-seven times last
          week... I said the f-word a couple
          times, but mostly "shits" and
          "bastards."
              (beat)
          Is "Douche bag" a curse?

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the
counter.

                    GRAHAM
          I suppose it's in its usage.

                    PHARMACIST
          How about "John you're a douche bag
          for kissing Barbara?"

                    GRAHAM
          That's a curse.

                    PHARMACIST
          Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's
          seventy-one.

Graham's eyes widen.

                    PHARMACIST
          I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip
          stick from K-mart... I punched my
          brother in the back three times...

Graham looks around the empty store for help.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. 
There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan
watches as the little girl takes careful sips.

Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace.

                    BO
          It's contaminated.

MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Carl, there's something wrong with
          our water!

Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.

                    MORGAN
          Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing
          about her drinking water.  She's
          had it her whole life.  Like a tick
          people have.  Except it's not a
          tick.

                    MRS. NATHAN
              (fascinated)
          Is that right?

Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with
the other glass.

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

                    MR. NATHAN (O.S.)
          Thirteen!

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan
points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on.

Beat.  Mrs. Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the
extraterrestrial book to her.

                    MORGAN
          I'll take it.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car.  Beat.

The driver's side opens and Graham sits in.

                    MERRILL
          Pharmacy crowded?

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want any one of you
          spending time with Tracey Abernathy
          alone.  Is that understood?

Beat.  Everyone nods, "yes."

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on. 
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression
too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Is that him?

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Yeah.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that
he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

                    BO
          Who is he?

Nobody says anything for the longest time.

                    MORGAN
          He's the man who killed mom.

Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into
the street.

EXT.  HESS HOME - AFTERNOON

THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.  The crops sway hypnotically in a
gentle breeze.

The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.  It comes
to a stop in front of the house.  The engine goes off.  No
one gets out.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

All four sit quietly not getting out.

A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor
out of his jacket.  He holds it in his lap.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          What if Bo's baby monitor is
          picking up signals from the
          extraterrestrials?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          All this crop stuff.  They did it
          twenty-five years ago.  It was a
          joke.

THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE.  MORGAN PULLS IT
AWAY FROM HIS EAR.

                    GRAHAM
          It's just static Morgan.  Turn it
          up and see.

Morgan turns a knob on the side.

THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR.  WE HEAR BEEPS
IN THE STATIC.  THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY
MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.

                    MORGAN
          It's a code.

                    GRAHAM
          Let me see that please.

Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat.  THE BEEPS
COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.

                    MERRILL
          It's noise.

                    GRAHAM
          It's broken Morgan.  It'll just
          keep doing this.
              (beat)
          Let's get out of the car okay?

                    MORGAN
          We might lose the signal.

                    GRAHAM
          We can't just sit in the car in our
          own driveway like this.

                    MERRILL
          We'll look like mental patients.

Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm getting out now.

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before
getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right
after.

OUTSIDE CAR

Graham stands and closes his driver side door.

THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE
STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND
TEXTURE.

                    MORGAN
          Nobody move!

Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. 
Three of the doors are open.

IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

                    MORGAN
          Voices.  Did you hear that?

Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.

                    MORGAN
          Not English though.  You heard the
          voices right Uncle Merrill?

                    BO
          I heard them Morgan.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air
where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to
Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          It's probably picking up another
          baby monitor.

                    MERRILL
          That's right.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE
STATION WAGON.

                    MERRILL
          Let me see it.

Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. 
Merrill reaches for it.

THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH
UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over
the roof of the station wagon.

WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN
QUICKLY FADE AWAY.

                    MORGAN
          It doesn't sound like words.

Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING
FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

Graham looks around at his rapt family.

                    GRAHAM
          See this is why we're not watching
          those news reports.  People get
          obsessed.
              (beat)
          I'm letting go now.

                    BO
          No dad!

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it!

                    MERRILL
          You'll lose the signal!

Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat.

Morgan is the first one to move.

                    MORGAN
          Don't let go.

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan?

                    MORGAN
          It gets clearer, the higher you
          hold it.

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, be careful.

                    MERRILL
          I got him.

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. 
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the
monitor above his head.

THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES
SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN
THE DISTANCE.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND
LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

                    GRAHAM
          Hold on.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes
hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill
holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both
hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill you got her.

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him. 
THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over
his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the
roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor
raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still
on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

THE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND
UPFRONT.  THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          There's two of them talking.

THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND
GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING.  THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED
BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE
TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS
ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.

Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her
arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER
AND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES
ALMOST GONE.

THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST
VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.

Beat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights
are off.  ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S
SPEAKER.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          They hung up.

Graham brings Bo down into his lap.  Morgan takes a seat next
to Merrill on the roof.  The Hess family sits like mental
patients on the top of their station wagon.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - EVENING

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. 
The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and
the children doing dishes after dinner.

The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.

OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. 
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
outside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically. 
She keeps looking in our direction.

WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
HOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
dog food and a bowl of water.

We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he
gets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully. 
He places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has
no interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our
direction.

Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BARN - EVENING

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the
dog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes
stay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to
no one.

                    GRAHAM
          You know something?  Even
          entertaining the possibility of
          this for a minute has been
          exciting.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

                    GRAHAM
          I can see how people can get
          carried away with this type of
          thing.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW
BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.

Graham starts toward the crops.

                    GRAHAM
          It's a kind of faith.  It's an
          intoxicating thing to believe in
          something you can't see.

THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and
then steps into the field of

CORN CROPS.

We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.

                    GRAHAM
          You were always good at that...

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham
starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either
side.

                    GRAHAM
          Believing in things you couldn't
          see.
              (beat)
          You would have been the first
          person on that station wagon
          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would
          have been wrestling for that baby
          monitor.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          It'll be secretly kind of sad for
          everybody, when this turns out to
          be -- all just make believe.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY
PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You're wasting your time here!  I'm
          not going to report this or
          anything you do to me crops, to the
          news or TV or anybody!  You're not
          going to get famous!

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
HIM.

Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.

Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE
BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.

GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS
FAST AND LOUD NOW.

Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands
search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch
the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.  He does.

A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY
WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.

It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get
up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts
running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. 
He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
BEHIND HIM.

Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as
he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

BACKYARD.

Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS
FRANTICALLY.

When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His
shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He
locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing
each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. 
He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't
notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs
one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the
baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the
children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They
follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Let's turn on the TV.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK.  THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN
IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS.  OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.

THE SOUND POPS ON.

                    TV REPORTER
          -- first appeared fifty two minutes
          ago.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS.  WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF
A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY.  THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE
CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.

ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE
ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.

Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
lights.

                    BO
          Fourteen.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
television set.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Mexico City officials as well as
          U.S. officials have confirmed that
          these are not air crafts from
          either government's airforce.  The
          first sighting was made by an Air
          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
          to New York as the unidentified
          crafts entered Mexico City air
          space.  They were not detected by
          radar by either country.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The crazies were right.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
the screen.

                    MORGAN
          We have to tape this...

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

Morgan stares at his sister.

                    MORGAN
              (gravely serious)
          Listen Bo.  This is very important. 
          Everything people have written
          about in science books is going to
          change.  The history of the world's
          future is on the TV right now.  We
          need to record this so you can show
          your children this tape and say you
          were there...
              (beat)
          For your children Bo.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

                    MORGAN
          Dad!

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

                    MORGAN
          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

                    TV ANCHOR

          Everything they wrote in science

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Told you.

Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That's true.

Merrill looks his brother in the eyes.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Do you think it's a possibility?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          How can you say that?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That wasn't the answer you wanted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Can you at least pretend to be like
          you used to be?  Give me some
          comfort?

Beat.  Graham thinks it over.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          ... There are all different ways
          you can tell that there's someone
          really there watching out for us. 
          You see signs.  Sometimes they're
          little ones.  You think of someone. 
          The phone rings.  They're on the
          phone... Sometimes they're big,
          like fourteen lights hovering over
          Mexico City.
              (beat)
          Sure, there are a lot of people
          watching this who think this could
          be a bad thing.  But there are a
          lot of people watching this, who
          think it's a miracle.  A sign of
          God's existence.  It's all in how
          you look at things Merrill.
              (beat)
          What you have to decide is what
          kind of person you are?  Are you
          the type who believes in miracles
          and looks for signs or are you the
          kind who believes, things just
          happen by chance?

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

                    MERRILL
          I was at this party once.  I'm on a
          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was
          just sitting there, looking
          beautiful and staring at me.  I go
          to lean in and kiss her and I
          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I
          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff
          it in my paper cup next to the sofa
          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney
          throws up all over herself.
              (beat)
          I knew the second it happened.  It
          was a miracle.  I could have been
          kissing her when she threw up. 
          That would have scarred me for
          life.  I may never have recovered.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights
          are a miracle.

Graham smiles.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          There you go.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          So which type are you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you feel comforted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          What does it matter then?

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know what Colleen's last
          words were before they killed her?

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          She said, "See", and then her eyes
          glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
          Merrill to swing away."

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at
his expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know why she said that?

Merrill nods, "No."

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Because the nerve endings in her
          brain were firing as she died, and
          some random memory of us at one of
          your baseball games popped into her
          head.
              (beat)
          There is no one watching out for us
          Merrill.  We're all on our own.

Graham turns back to the television.  Beat.

THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO
BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is
alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes
stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. 
Graham opens the

CLOSET.

Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

                    MERRILL
          For the kids protection.  All they
          were doing was watching TV from
          five a.m.  I felt like they were
          getting obsessed like you said. 
          They should be playing furry, furry
          rabbit or tea party or something
          right?

                    GRAHAM
          What's furry, furry rabbit?

                    MERRILL
              (points)
          That's a game isn't it?
              (beat)
          Anyway...
              (points at the TV)
          There's been some interesting
          developments.

                    GRAHAM
          What time is it?

                    MERRILL
          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight
shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

                    MERRILL
          But they're not really gone.  We
          just can't see them.  Early this
          morning a bird flew right at the
          area where the lights were hovering
          last night.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

                    MERRILL
          It stopped dead in the air and fell
          straight down.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

                    MERRILL
          They caught it on tape and they've
          been playing it all morning.  They
          found the bird.  His head crushed
          in.  When you see the footage it
          looks like the bird flew into a
          wall in the sky.
              (beat)
          They think they have some invisible
          shield thing going, like an optical
          illusion.

                    GRAHAM
          The bird could have had a heart
          attack and crushed his head when he
          fell.

                    MERRILL
          Already thought of.  Two other
          birds did the same thing an hour
          later.  Not as dramatic.  They
          lived.  But you could see they hit
          something.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
eyes.

                    MERRILL
          They're still there hovering.  In
          fact, some people think there's
          more of them now.  All over the
          place.  Over us even.
              (beat)
          And there's a theory about the crop
          circles now.  They think it could
          be some kind of landmark, visual
          mapping system -- so they can
          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense
          doesn't it?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large
cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. 
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
BEGINNING.

The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A
single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of
the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet
high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them
quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
WINDOW.

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT
ROOM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have
TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham
stares at his children.

                    MORGAN
          So the aliens can't read our minds.

                    GRAHAM
          Oh.

                    MORGAN
          They tell you everything in this
          book.

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on
the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book
on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          It says they're probably very small
          -- like my height -- because, as
          their brains developed, there was
          no use for physical development. 
          It says they're probably
          vegetarians, because they would
          have realized the benefits of such
          a diet.

                    GRAHAM
          Who wrote this book?

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none
there.

                    MORGAN
          Scientists who have been persecuted
          for their beliefs.

                    GRAHAM
          That means they're unemployed.

Morgan closes the book.

                    MORGAN
          Dad, are you going to be serious?

Bo points at the book.

                    BO
          Yeah, serious.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't know what got into me.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          There are pictures.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

                    MORGAN
          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
          the book --

                    GRAHAM
          Bimboo?

                    MORGAN
          Dad.

                    GRAHAM
          I just asked his name.

                    MERRILL
          You had a tone.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
tone.

                    MORGAN
          He says there are two reasons why
          Extraterrestrials would visit us.

Morgan turns the page.

                    MORGAN
          To make contact in the spirit of
          exploration and furthering the
          knowledge of the universe.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

                    MORGAN
          Or the other reason... They're
          hostile.  They've used up the
          resources on their planet and are
          looking to harvest our planet next.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A
space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
it.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Looks a little like our house
          doesn't it?

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

                    BO
          The same windows.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          That's weird.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on
fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three
bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

THE PHONE RINGS.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS
DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes
the book.

                    GRAHAM
          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
          now.  Everybody in this house needs
          to calm down and eat some fruit or
          something.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under
his arm and picks up the phone.

                    PHONE VOICE
          Father.

THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello?

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then
slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. 
Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we
see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves
to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going out for a few minutes. 
          No one leaves this house.  No one.

Merrill nods.

                    MERRILL
          Where are you going?

                    GRAHAM
          Ray Reddy's house.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet
for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

                    MERRILL
          Why?

Graham unlocks the front door.

                    GRAHAM
          I think he just called here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

BLUE SKY -- OUR VIEW MOVES OVER CLOUDS.  WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH SOME KIND OF LENS.

                    BO (O.S.)
          You don't think something bad will
          happen do you Morgan?

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up
on the window seat in his room.

                    MORGAN
          Why, you got one of your feeling
          again?

Bo nods, "Yes."

                    MORGAN
          Is it bad?

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

                    MORGAN
          If it does, I won't let anything
          bad happen to you.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

                    BO
              (soft)
          I don't want you to die.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

                    MORGAN
          Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look
          out.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the
telescope.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY

A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the
house.  He looks in a side window.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN
CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS
TOTALLY WRECKED.

Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out
the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What happened Ray?

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

                    RAY
          I wrote your number down to call
          you.  It's been sitting next to the
          phone for six months.  When I knew
          it was inside the house, I couldn't
          think of any other number to call. 
          I panicked.
              (beat)
          Thank you for coming Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          You're welcome Ray.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

                    RAY
          I worked so long that night.  I
          ain't never fallen asleep driving
          before.  And never since.  Most of
          the ride home, there wasn't a car
          insight in either direction.  If
          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It
          had to happen at that right moment. 
          That certain ten-fifteen seconds
          when I passed her walking.  It was
          like it was meant to be.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

                    RAY
          I guess if this is the end of the
          world, I'm screwed right?  People
          who kill Reverends' wives aren't
          exactly ushered to the front of the
          line in heaven.

Ray starts the car.

                    GRAHAM
          Where you going Ray?

                    RAY
          To the lake.  The way I see it, all
          the places marked in the crops and
          such -- none of them are really
          near water.  I figure they don't
          like water.
              (beat)
          Can't be any worse than here.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Ray, did you see one of them?

Ray looks at Graham.

                    RAY
          I'm truly sorry for what I've done
          to you and yours.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. 
He puts the car in drive.

                    RAY
          And don't open my pantry Father.  I
          locked one of them in there.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - DAY

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. 
His eyes are closed.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... The startling footage we're
          about to show you was photographed
          by a forty-two year old Romero
          Valadares.

Merrill's eyes open.

                    TV ANCHOR
          This video was taken yesterday
          afternoon at his son's seventh
          birthday, in the city of Passo
          Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the
          local news bureau there and
          satellited to us a few minutes ago. 
          All initial opinions are; this is
          genuine.

THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.

                    TV ANCHOR
          What you are about to see, may
          disturb you.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
GLASS WINDOW.

THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT
THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A
RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED
BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE
BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.

THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL
AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE
DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a
little towards the television screen.

WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. 
HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING
INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE
IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.

THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.

                    MERRILL
          Move children!  Vamonos!

THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH
THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.

WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW
ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A
SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS
DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
BUILDING.

WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE
LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY
DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.

                    BOY WITH HAT
          Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras
          de ai!  Is behind!

THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES
BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE
ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE
IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.

AND THEN WE SEE IT.

THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-
HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE
WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.

Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. 
The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE
VIDEO.

THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT
REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A
FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE
BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL
WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.

THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE
NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.
IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.

Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL
LIKE CREATURE.  THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE
BRANCHES.  EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES.  THEY MATCH THE BUSHES
WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's
kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned
over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
INSIDE THE PANTRY.

Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
IT'S BEING WALKED ON.

Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. 
Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          The police are here... I am with
          them... I am a police officer.
              (beat)
          I just want to talk to you.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          We know all about the hoax.  We
          already took some of your friends
          downtown in the paddy wagon.
              (mouths to himself)
          Paddy wagon?

THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET
RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

                    GRAHAM
          If you tell us your name and why
          you did it, we'll give you the same
          deal we gave the others.  Don't
          throw away your life son.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. 
WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE
CAN'T SEE INTO.

Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet
from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. 
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.

GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE
HARD.

FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN
FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.

GRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON
THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.  SLAM!

WE HEAR AN UNBEARABLY HIGH-PITCHED INHALE SOUND FROM INSIDE
THE PANTRY.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STATION WAGON - DAY

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the
road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Douche bag.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks
it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          They're skin changes color.  That's
          why we couldn't see him that night.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

                    MORGAN
          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

                    MERRILL
          I'm sorry, what book is this?

                    GRAHAM
          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

                    MORGAN
          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

                    GRAHAM
          What's two?

                    MORGAN
          They win.

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second
step of the stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you think about the idea
          that they don't like places near
          water, and we might be safe from
          them near a lake or something?

                    MORGAN
          Sounds made up.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          We can choose to believe it and
          pack up and leave.
              (beat)
          Or we can stay here.  Board up this
          house.  Hide inside our home and
          wait it out.  Either way, at least
          we'll be together.
              (beat)
          All those in favor of the lake,
          raise your hand.

No one raises their hand.

                    GRAHAM
          All those in favor of home, raise
          your hand.

All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them
and sit in silence.

                    MERRILL
          How do we know boards will do
          anything?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Because, they seem to have trouble
          with pantry doors.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. 
He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. 
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.

WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.

Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. 
And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...

THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.

The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.

                    MORGAN
          Come quick!

THE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.

WE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE
SEE THEM.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the
closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH
SUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED. 
OTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE
IS PANIC IN THE AIR.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and
          Jerusalem as the latest to confirm
          the appearance of lights.  There
          are lights in the skies over an
          estimated two hundred and seventy
          four cities.  That total could be
          as high as four hundred within the
          hour.

THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME
VIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN
TWO "V" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.

                    GRAHAM
          They decided to show themselves.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          They think these look like stages
          immediately proceeding an attack
          maneuver.

                    MERRILL
          It's like War of the Worlds.

                    MORGAN
          They think it might happen all at
          once.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second
before starting up again.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Hundreds of thousands have flocked
          to synagogues, churches and
          temples.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in
the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Ground forces are being assembled
          in countries throughout the
          globe...

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going to get back to the
          windows.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She
turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          You guys okay?

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto
trucks on the television.

                    MORGAN
          Some guy had a sign that said it
          was the end of the world.
              (beat)
          Nothing really bad is going to
          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

                    MERRILL
          Don't worry.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

                    MORGAN
          You sure right?

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks
back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He
turns back to the children.

                    MERRILL
          You know about signs Morgan?  Not
          like the ones people write on. 
          It's like if you poured a glass of
          milk and you dropped the glass by
          mistake and broke it before you
          could drink it.  Then you looked at
          the milk carton and saw that the
          milk was spoiled.  They're things
          that happen by chance or luck, but
          make you feel that someone's
          watching out for you.

The children think it over.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I once had a bad dream and I
          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the
          table next to my bed and something
          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a
          picture of mom.  She was smiling. 
          It made me feel safe... You mean
          like that?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Yeah, like that.
              (beat)
          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think
          there's someone watching out for
          us.  I got to believe he's going to
          make sure we're all right in the
          end.

INT.  HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the
door half-way.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep
breaths as everything hits him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan turns off the television.

He and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Graham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his
lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his
thoughts as the skies darken behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. 
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

                    MERRILL
          Too many windows in the bedrooms. 
          We don't have enough boards.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          We'll have to board up the bedroom
          doors.

                    MORGAN
          Where are we going to sleep?

                    GRAHAM
          The family room.

Everyone sits quietly for a moment.

                    MORGAN
          What about Isabelle?

                    GRAHAM
          We'll keep her in the garage, after
          dinner.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'll make sandwiches.

                    BO
          I want spaghetti?

                    MERRILL
          We should eat fast Bo.

                    GRAHAM
          Spaghetti sounds great.

Merrill glances at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you want, Morgan?

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          Anything?

Graham nods "yes."

                    MORGAN
          French toast... and mashed
          potatoes.

                    GRAHAM
          Now we're talking.
              (beat)
          How about you Merrill?

Graham turns and looks at Merrill.  They stare at each other
quietly.  They have a conversation without words.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Chicken Teriyaki.

                    GRAHAM
          Good choice... I'm going to have a
          cheeseburger with bacon.
              (smiles)
          Extra bacon.

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back
door.

The sink is piled with pots and pans.  It seems like every
utensil and dish in the kitchen was used.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DINNING ROOM - EVENING

One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have
been boarded up.

The table is set.  Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast,
chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed
elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is
somber.  No one is moving.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter with everyone? 
          Eat.

No one says anything.  No one eats.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I'm scared.

                    BO
          Me too.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want to hear anymore talk
          like that.  And I don't want to see
          anymore faces like the ones I'm
          looking at.
              (beat)
          We are going to enjoy this meal. 
          Nothing can stop us from enjoying
          this meal!  Enjoy!

Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.

                    GRAHAM
          Stop crying!

                    MORGAN
          Don't yell at her!

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. 
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

                    GRAHAM
          Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
          then I'm going to have some of
          everything.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
in his mouth.  He swallows.

                    GRAHAM
          This tastes so great.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows
hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. 
More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He
leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's
fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's
shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
table.  Beat.

THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.

Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED
LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. 
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and
into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. 
He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A
LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. 
THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE
SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children
are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It's happening.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards
to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is
open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his
bedroom

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same
one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light
breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the
top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE
TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. 
ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES
MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES
THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...
TEN...

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
bedroom.

                    MERRILL
          Graham hurry.

Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in
the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the
bedroom door behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer
and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are
standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds
Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you what everyone
          said when you were born, Bo?

Bo nods "no" lightly.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out of your momma and you
          didn't even cry.  You just opened
          your eyes and looked around at
          everybody.  Your eyes were so big
          and gorgeous, the ladies in the
          room gasped.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

                    GRAHAM
          They literally gasped.
              (Graham gasps like them)
          Then they go, "She's like an
          angel."  They said, "We've never
          seen a baby so beautiful."

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill
finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          And you know what else happened?

Bo nods, "no."

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          When they put you on the table to
          clean you up, you looked at me and
          smiled.  They say babies that young
          can't smile... You smiled.

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair
out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. 
Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Let's go down now.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

Graham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. 
Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in
a tight group.

THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot about Isabelle.

ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN
AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY
STOPS.

THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Should we turn off the lights?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          They already know we're here.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF
WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.

THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.

SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL
NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.

                    MORGAN
              (almost inaudible)
          Dad --

THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

                    GRAHAM
          Do you know what happened when you
          were born Morgan?

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out and your momma kept
          bleeding.  The doctors rushed you
          out of the room before I could even
          see you.

THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.

All four look up.

                    MERRILL
          They're on the roof.

                    GRAHAM
          While they were trying to fix her
          up, all she kept asking about was
          you.

THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.

THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.

Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

                    MERRILL
          They're in the house.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

                    GRAHAM
          I wanted your momma to see you
          first.  She had dreamed about you
          her whole life.
              (beat)
          They waited till she felt better,
          then they brought you in.  They
          placed you right in her arms.  And
          she looked at you.  And you looked
          at her.  You just stared at each
          other for the longest time and then
          she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
          I'm you momma, you look just like I
          dreamed."

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.

The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. 
The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in
the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The attic door.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is
movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light
right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. 
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door
starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. 
The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few
more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns
red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

                    MERRILL
          This is a very temporary solution.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching
from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he
is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. 
A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
          How temporary?

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

                    MERRILL
          Twenty-two seconds.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its
top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts
rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still
attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches
into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to
Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a
few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

                    GRAHAM
          Let go.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It
connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The
trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. 
THUD.

The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.

Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
THE DOOR.

THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
UPSTAIRS.

Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes
Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
stairs.

ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at
the pile of furniture.

                    MERRILL
          This is going to do nothing.

                    GRAHAM
          We have to go in the basement.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
darkened door at the bottom.

                    MERRILL
          There's no way out of there.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
          Uncle Merrill's arm?

THUD.

                    MERRILL
          Should we make a run for it out the
          back?

                    GRAHAM
          They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to
Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          He was only a year and half old.

                    MERRILL
              (to Graham)
          What are you doing?

                    GRAHAM
          He was trying to eat a second
          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,
          "No."  He tried to take a bite, so
          I grabbed it.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and
stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

                    GRAHAM
          I must have pulled his arm at an
          awkward angle.  His elbow popped
          right out of the socket.

THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE
CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
HALL.

WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.

                    GRAHAM
          He didn't scream or anything.  His
          arm just flopped to his side and he
          got real still.

                    MERRILL
          They're coming.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          I held him in my lap in the back
          seat as we drove to the hospital. 
          I couldn't stop crying... We need
          to go into the basement now.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan
and Bo move to their father slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          You know what your Uncle Merrill
          did right after the doctor put his
          arm back in place?  He jumped off
          the table and gave me a hug.  He
          had already forgotten that I was
          the one who hurt him.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for
Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

                    MERRILL
          We won't be able to get out of
          there.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at
his older brother.

                    MERRILL
          I know.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He
watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
it.  Beat.

THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.

The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
CHALK BOARD.

WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE
FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot our foil helmets!

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

                    GRAHAM
          We need something to wedge against
          the doorknob.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are
cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill
rummages through the shelves frantically.

                    MORGAN
          They'll read our minds!

                    GRAHAM
          You're scaring your sister.

                    BO
          I'm already scared.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill --

                    MERRILL
          I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking
things to the ground.

                    MORGAN
              (to himself)
          They'll know our secret thoughts.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. 
Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push
open.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill!

                    MERRILL
          Got it!

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. 
It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is
the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

THE BULB SHATTERS.

THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.

                    BO
          Dad!

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING
AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.

CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.

IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.

THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL
AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A
LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.

THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
LESSEN.

Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
FACE.

                    GRAHAM
          Where's Bo?

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,
BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S
HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.

                    BO
          I'm okay.

ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.

HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.

He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound
emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob
and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He
listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          What's happening out there?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (in the dark)
          I can't even imagine.

THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.

                    MORGAN
          I hope they're doing better than we
          are.  We don't even have helmets.

THERE IS A LOUD BANG.

BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.

ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.

BANG.

GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door
and then turns and faces the lights.

                    GRAHAM
          They're just making noises. 
          They're not trying to get in.
              (beat)
          Why are they doing that?

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan
moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

                    MERRILL
          They want our attention on the
          door?

BANG.  A beat of silence.

                    GRAHAM
          They're distracting us?

                    MERRILL
          From what?

                    MORGAN
          The book says they're probably very
          good problem solvers.

                    MERRILL
          What book!

                    MORGAN
          They'll find a way in.

BANG.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, give me your flashlight.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it
up.

                    GRAHAM
          Is there an air vent in here?

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The
brothers move in opposite directions.

GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING AS HE MOVES.

MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT
PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.

A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

                    GRAHAM
          I can feel air.

                    MERRILL
          Me too.

THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

                    GRAHAM
          It's getting stronger.

                    MERRILL
          I'm close.

BANG.

THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND
MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.

HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE
TWO LIGHTS.

                    MORGAN
          What?

IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
A BREEZE.

GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.

EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET
OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.

MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S
A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.

WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

                    MERRILL (O.S.)
          Hold the vent!

SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.

                    GRAHAM
          Pull him!

THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS
BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.

BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY
MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.

BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH
ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
THE REST.

MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.

Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his
side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM
AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.

HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S
FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.

GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.

                    GRAHAM
          We don't have his medicine.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
child's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow
          it down together.  Feel my chest. 
          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe
          like me.  Breathe like me.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
and panic.

                    BO
          He can't breathe.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks
into Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I
          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...
          It'll pass.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't do this to me again.  Not
          again.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength
they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up
with water.

Graham's eyes close.

                    GRAHAM
          I hate you.  I hate you...

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          The fear is feeding it... Don't be
          afraid of what's happening...
          Believe it's going to pass...
          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
          afraid... The air is coming...
          Believe... We don't have to be
          afraid... It's about to pass...
          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
          Here comes the air...

A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE
SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.

                    GRAHAM
          There we go... We don't have to be
          scared at all... We know it'll
          pass.  We believe it... Don't be
          afraid Morgan.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
THROUGH A STRAW.

Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
son.

                    GRAHAM
          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. 
          Together... The air is going in our
          lungs... Together... We're the
          same.  We're the same.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
Graham's.

THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
LABORED BREATHS.

Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          I hate you.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as
father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each
other tight.

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST
IN THEIR THOUGHTS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I should save the flashlights.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF
LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.

Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
HER AND MERRILL.

Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the
button.

THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING

WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. 
IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.

                    VOICE
          ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
          Bahrain have also confirmed.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT
OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

                    MERRILL
          I found a pack of light bulbs.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE
VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF
THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... Parts of China and Northern
          Korea are among the few remaining
          to verify withdrawals.

                    GRAHAM
          They're broadcasting...

                    MERRILL
          It came on about two hours ago. 
          Woke me up.
              (beat)
          We won Graham.

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It went on all night.  Everywhere. 
          It was completely a ground battle. 
          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see
          them unless you're up close.  A lot
          of people died.  Some from combat. 
          But most from poison gas
          inhalation.  They secrete it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          How many died?

                    MERRILL
          They think over a hundred thousand. 
          They're just estimates.
              (beat)
          But we held strong.

                    GRAHAM
          How do they know it's over?

                    MERRILL
          A mass evacuation by them started
          about eight o'clock this morning. 
          It's eleven now.
              (beat)
          They're leaving.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          You didn't think we'd make it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
              (low voice)
          Listen, there's things I can take
          and a couple things I can't and one
          of them I can't take, is when my
          older brother --
              (voice cracks)
          -- who is everything I want to be,
          starts losing faith in things.  I
          saw your eyes last night.
              (beat)
          I don't want to ever see your eyes
          like that again, okay?  I'm
          serious.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at
the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham
and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. 
He still looks grey.

                    MERRILL
          He's been like that for awhile.  We
          need to get him some medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          Have they said anything about our
          area?

                    MERRILL
          Philadelphia and its outlying
          counties are cleared, but who knows
          for sure?

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham
turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          He's not strong enough to fight off
          another attack.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          I know.
              (beat)
          We need to be sure, before we open
          that door Graham.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. 
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across
the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. 
Beat.

He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. 
THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY
ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          That's good enough for me.

                    GRAHAM
          Me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING

DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE
STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill
opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top
and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the
bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in
his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS
OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN
THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

                    GRAHAM
          Get the syringe as well.  We might
          need to give him an epinephrine
          shot.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that
have fallen from the cabinets.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM
WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE
FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

                    BO
          People are dancing.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at
him.

                    GRAHAM
          You want to see it?

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

                    GRAHAM
          I'll bring the TV in here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - MORNING

THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM
AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.

                    TV REPORTER
          Today there are no countries, and
          no races, and no differences -- we
          are all apart of the same --

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
the television cart out into the hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful
not to trip it on the carpet.

THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.

Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN
REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.

THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
TELEVISION SCREEN.

The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on
either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. 
His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's
face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we
see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on
the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the
front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his
hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and
Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES
FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.

The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its
fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.

A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.

Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.

GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION
IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          He's reading my --

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE
ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE
REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is
open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men
look at each other.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What do you know?

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          There was an accident.  Drunk
          driving.  They weren't sure.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell
          asleep at the wheel.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His
arms rest on his bent knees.

                    GRAHAM
          Is he okay?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes... That's the first thing
          Colleen asked too.

Graham smiles a little smile.

                    GRAHAM
          She's talking... Which ambulance is
          she in?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She's not in an ambulance Father.

                    GRAHAM
          Why not?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
          then a tree.  She was pinned
          between the two.

                    GRAHAM
          Pinned?  What does that mean?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          The truck... the truck has severed
          most of her lower half.

                    GRAHAM
          What did you say?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She won't be saved.  At this point
          she's alive, because the truck is
          holding her together.  She doesn't
          feel much, and she's talking almost
          like normal.  We didn't pull the
          truck out, cause we wanted you to
          come down here to be with her, as
          long as she's awake.  That won't be
          very long.
              (beat)
          Father, you understand what I've
          told you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar.
              (he starts crying)
          Is this the last time I'm going to
          talk to my wife?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes it is.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He
walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the
side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back
is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.  She is shivering slightly.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          Hi sweetie.

                    GRAHAM
          Hi baby.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

                    COLLEEN
          I was just taking a walk before
          dinner.

                    GRAHAM
          You love walks.

Beat.

                    COLLEEN
          I guess it was meant to be.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Does it hurt?

                    COLLEEN
          I don't feel much.

                    GRAHAM
          Good.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts
crying with her.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Morgan to play games --
          it's okay to be silly.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Bo to listen to her
          brother.  He'll always take care of
          her.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Graham --

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          I'm here.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          Tell him... See.  Tell him to see.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests
on it.  Her eyes are distant.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          And tell Merrill to swing away.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What?
              (beat)
          Colleen?... Colleen?

WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS
FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING
RELEASED.

THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS
FACE.

THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON
TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Swing away, Merrill.

Morgan's face is obscured by gas.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          Merrill.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Swing away.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye
line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn
with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through
the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room
in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop
lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is
the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. 
The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham
picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on
fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles
pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with
the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back
into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's
skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They
stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
all over the family room.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back
door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps
outside.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The
creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of
water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER
HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. 
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to
the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon
cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He
nods.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn. 
His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES
THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF
THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.

THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. 
IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS
ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.

THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A
WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.

Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle
of the bat in his hands.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan
lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with
him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to
Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.
              (beat)
          His lungs were closed.  No poison
          got in... No poison got in.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Graham.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

                    BO
          Daddy.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

Bo is crying.

                    MERRILL
          Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't.

Beat.

                    MORGAN'S VOICE
          Dad.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Did someone save me?

                    GRAHAM
          Yeah baby.  I think someone did.

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We look out through the broken glass of the second story
bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the
single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the
golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass. 
Huddled together in the sunlight.

FADE IN:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The
backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. 
Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A
CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
COMING FROM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard
something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE
REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and
white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
bedroom door.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING

Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings
taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He
puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
bedroom.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR
THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's
ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.

The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the
doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very
still.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his
children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. 
Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both
empty.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.

MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. 
Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His
muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and
looks around bewildered.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.

                    MERRILL
          Where are they?

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

                    CHILDREN
              (yelling in the distance)
          Daaaad!

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  CROPS - MORNING

The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. 
Her hair is messed from sleep.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo where's Morgan?

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo?

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

                    BO
          Are you in my dreams too?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          This isn't a --

                    BOY (O.S.)
          Dad!

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's
close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan what's happening?

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.

                    GRAHAM
          Are... you... hurt?

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

                    MORGAN
          I think God did it.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

                    GRAHAM
          Did what Morgan?

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham
sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving
forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. 
They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.

WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          ... Lee actually the reason I'm
          calling is about Lionel.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Was he at home last night with you
          or was he out and about with the
          Wolfington brothers?

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Well, there was a little mischief
          done to our crops last night.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          I know he's a fine boy... No one's
          saying otherwise.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

KITCHEN.

Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
VOICE.

                    GRAHAM
              (into phone)
          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
          was him.  You could just talk to
          him and that would be enough for
          me... See it was kind of strange
          finding the crops like that.  The
          kids were... confused by it.  It
          would take the strangeness away if
          we knew it was Lionel and the
          Wolfington brothers just messing
          around...
              (beat, listens)
          The movies...
              (beat)
          Are you sure?
              (beat)
          Okay, then... Thank you for your
          patience Lee.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

                    GRAHAM
          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.
          Reynolds.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down
the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.

                    GRAHAM
          That was quick Edgar.  I only
          called you boys about two hours
          ago.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
          she put it, "diving for her life"
          when a bunch of school kids rode
          down the sidewalk on skateboards. 
          She went down to Thorton's store
          this morning and started spitting
          on the new skateboards.  Spitting! 
          By the time I got there, Mrs.
          Kindleman had sprayed the whole
          damn place... She must have had a
          cold or something.  It was enough
          to turn a grown man's stomach.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          So what happened to your crops?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME

Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. 
She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

                    BO
          I think it's contaminated.

                    MORGAN
          You don't even know what that word
          means.

He drinks.

                    MORGAN
          It's not contaminated.  It's just
          tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

                    BO
          It tastes funny.

                    MORGAN
          He licks his butt everyday.  He's
          not going to mind.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He
doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

HOUDINI MOVES...

BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...

HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

BEAT.  The children turn white.

                    MORGAN
          Houdini?

HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up.

                    MORGAN
          Bo don't run.

Houdini crouches down.

                    MORGAN
          What's wrong boy?

THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.

                    MORGAN
          Stop it Houdini!

The German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about
to leap.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Bo, run.

EXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away. 
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat.

The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat. 
Officer Paski yells over the wind.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          It's the strangest thing Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          What's that?

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          Don't call me Father.  It's just
          Graham now.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          Sorry.

They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each
other.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You said something was strange. 
          What's strange?

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (yelling)
          The footprints.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          What about them?

                    OFFICER PASKI

          There are none.

EXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a
single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.

                    OFFICER PASKI
              (soft)
          Look at where it's bent over.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

                    GRAHAM
          It's not broken.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What kind of machine can bend a
          stalk of corn over without cracking
          it?

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn
stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.

                    GRAHAM
              (softy)
          Can't be by hand... It's too
          perfect.

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Doesn't sound much like Lionel
          Prichard and the Wolfington
          brothers.  They can't take a piss
          without wetting the front of their
          pants.

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Second thing this week I can't
          explain.

                    GRAHAM
          What was the first thing?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Some animals around the county
          exhibiting uncharacteristic
          behavior.  Sometimes violent
          behavior.  Theo Henry had two of
          his fingers bit off by his cow.

                    GRAHAM
          Sounds like a virus.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. 
          Like they act when they smell a
          predator around... Peeing on
          themselves and everything.

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the
roof over the crops.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Edgar, please don't call me Father.

The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them. 
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What's wrong?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't hear my children.

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they
look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.

Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma
spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          He wanted to kill Bo.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

                    GRAHAM
          Did he hurt you?

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him
up in his arms.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers in his ear)
          I'm so sorry Morgan.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her
face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.

                    MERRILL
          I used a little Tabasco in the
          potato salad.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

                    BO
          Houdini's sick.

                    GRAHAM
          Please tie up Isabelle to the back
          of the shed.  Make sure the knot's
          tight.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He
nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.

Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as
he lies by himself.

          They're tough cookies, those two. 
          They think Houdini's playing with
          you up there.
              (beat)
          At least it got them to sleep.

Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little.

                    GRAHAM
          Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one
          for you... What can make geometric
          shapes the size of a football
          field... and what would scare every
          animal in this county?
              (beat)

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His
daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is
five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                    BO
          I saw a monster.  Can I have a
          glass of water?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What's wrong with the water next to
          your bed?

                    BO
          It tastes old.

Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's
hand and starts out of the room.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the rule about getting up in
          the middle of the night?

                    BO
          Only for pee or poop.

                    GRAHAM
          Right.

Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened
hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him
back onto the pillow and covers him up.

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham
moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares
back at him as she holds her panda.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What are you thinking about?

                    BO
              (soft)
          Why do you talk to mom when you're
          by yourself?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It makes me feel better.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Does she ever answer back?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          No.

                    BO
              (soft)
          She doesn't answer me either.

Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment.

Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE
SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND
STARES AT HIM.

THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S
BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF.

Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes.

                    BO
              (soft)
          Get under a blanket.  They can't
          get you under the blankets.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

GREY SNOW FILLS THE SCREEN.  Merrill sleeps in front of the
family room television.

A hand gently shakes him.  Merrill wakes and looks up at his
brother zipping up his overcoat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.

                    MERRILL
          Okay, this guy is trying to scare
          us.  He's messed with our property,
          he's coming around the house.  It's
          time for an ass whoopin'!

                    GRAHAM
          This is not an intelligent way to
          approach this.

Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside. 
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          We both go outside and move around
          the house in opposite directions. 
          We act crazy, insane with anger. 
          Make him crap in his pants and
          force him around till we meet up on
          the other side.

Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain, act crazy?

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Curse and stuff.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          I'm not going to curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You don't mean it.  It's just for
          show.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          It doesn't sound natural when I
          curse.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Just make noises then.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          Explain noises.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          Are you going to do this or what?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispering)
          No I'm not.

                    MERRILL
              (whispering)
          You want him coming in the house
          next time?

Beat.

They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into
the darkness.

                    MERRILL
              (hushed tone)
          On the count of three.
              (beat)
          One... two... three.

Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite
directions.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the
building as he runs.

                    MERRILL
          We're gonna beat your ass bitch!

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of
the house.  He waves his arms.

                    GRAHAM
          Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger.

Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead
of him.

                    GRAHAM
          I've lost my mind!  It's time for
          an ass whoopin'!

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME
TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.  HE SEEMS TO BLEND
INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL.

                    MERRILL
          I'm gonna tear your head off!

Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS
AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come
to a stop facing each other.  Beat.

They look around, panting heavily.

                    GRAHAM
          I cursed.

                    MERRILL
          I heard.

Graham's eyes drift above them.

                    GRAHAM
          He's on the roof.

They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves
in the backyard.

Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just
catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the
crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being
hit.

They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR
HEAVY BREATHING.

                    MERRILL (V.O.)
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM (V.O.)
          Yes it was.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad
open.  He faces Graham and Merrill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You can't describe him at all? 
          Don't you think that's find of odd?

                    GRAHAM
          It does seem kind of odd doesn't
          it?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know whether to look for a
          midget or a --

                    GRAHAM
          He definitely wasn't a midget.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Okay.
              (beat)
          So he was tall?

                    GRAHAM
              (to Merrill)
          I would say so.

                    MERRILL
          Probably.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Over six feet?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It was very dark.

                    GRAHAM
          Yes, it was.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          We've established that.
              (beat)
          Just tell me about his clothing
          then.

Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
          jeans?

They keep staring.  Edgar closes his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Let me ask you two something. 
          Don't be embarrassed by the answer. 
          It is possible... Just possible
          now, you might have been chasing
          each other around?  You said you
          went in opposite directions.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
          saying it, as it is to you hearing
          it.  But we couldn't see him.  He
          stayed mostly in the shadows.  All
          we could make out was movement.
              (beat)
          But I'll tell you something with
          absolute certainty.  There was
          someone watching our house last
          night.  He was looking in my
          children's windows and I want you
          to find him Edgar.
              (beat)
          I need you to take this seriously,
          just incase, it is something
          serious.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I apologize.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby
monitor.

                    MORGAN
          Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
          a walkie-talkie?

                    GRAHAM
          Yes.

                    MORGAN
          It needs batteries.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar, come inside.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.

Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down
on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

KITCHEN.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          How certain are you, that this was
          a male?

                    MERRILL
          I don't know any girls can run like
          that.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          These are D's; I need double A's.

                    GRAHAM
          I have some upstairs.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I don't know Merrill.  I've seen
          some of those women on the
          Olympics.  They could out run me
          easy.

They all move into the

FAMILY ROOM.

Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.

                    MERRILL
          This guy got on the roof in like a
          second.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, can you turn down the volume
          until Officer Paski leaves?

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow
Graham up the

STAIRS.

                    MERRILL
          That roof is over ten feet high.

                    GRAHAM
          He's telling you the truth, Edgar. 
          Whoever it was, is very strong and
          can jump pretty high.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.  He moves into his

BATHROOM.

They all move in with him.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          They got women's high jumping in
          the Olympics.  They got these
          Scandinavian women who could jump
          clean over me.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open
the back.

                    GRAHAM
          Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I
          have double A's in here.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.

                    GRAHAM
          I know you're making a point Edgar. 
          I just don't know what it is.

They moves down the STAIRS.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
          woman stopped by the diner and
          started yelling and cussing cause
          they didn't have her favorite
          cigarettes at the vending machine. 
          Scared a couple of customers.  No
          one's seen her since... My point
          is, we don't know anything about
          the person you saw.  We should just
          keep all possibilities available.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

                    BO
          Dad, where's the remote?

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops
with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over
to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands
next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

                    GRAHAM
          Bo, you're too old to still be
          doing this.  The rule is, you take
          a glass of water, you finish it.
              (beat)
          Now what's wrong with this one?

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.  Looks at the glass.

                    BO
          There's dust in it.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          A hair.

                    GRAHAM
          This one?

                    BO
          Morgan took a sip.  It has his
          amoebas in it.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads
towards the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Excluding the possibility that a
          female Scandinavian Olympian was
          running around outside our house
          last night, what else is a
          possibility?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'm not done asking questions and I
          don't appreciate the sarcasm.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you have anyone who might have a
          grudge or something against you? 
          Maybe a church member, who might
          not have liked the fact, that you
          left the church?

Graham looks at Edgar.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't think so.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Do you owe anybody money?  You can
          tell me off the record if you need
          too.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
          No.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Is anything missing?

                    GRAHAM
          No.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A
STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.

                    MORGAN
          It's still making the noises.  It's
          broken.

                    GRAHAM
          It's old Morgan.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

                    MERRILL
          Listen, I was out of line with that
          whole female Scandinavian Olympian
          thing.

Edgar nods.

                    MERRILL
          It's just that, I'm pretty strong
          and pretty fast.  And I was running
          as fast as I could.  And this
          guy...
              (embarrassed smile)
          He was just toying with us.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches
Edgar think it over.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. 
He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He
gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Could everyone just take a seat on
          the couch.  I have some preliminary
          thoughts.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          There are three possibilities here. 
          We'll call them one, two and three. 
          The level one scenario is that
          there is a sane individual, who for
          real reasons wants to do you harm. 
          I really don't believe that's what
          we're looking at here.  In my
          opinion, whoever this is, they
          don't want to do harm to you all. 
          That's kind of clear.
              (beat)
          The level two scenario is, this is
          a mentally unstable person who's
          fixated on you and your family. 
          This is a possibility, but a very
          slim one.
              (beat)
          I assure you I will treat all three
          possibilities carefully, but in all
          likely hood we are looking at what
          we'll call a level three scenario. 
          He's a watcher.  Someone who this
          is a game for.  He's laying low. 
          Doesn't want to be seen.  But he
          wants to watch you.  Study you
          folks.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and
Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next
to the television.

ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE
IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.

Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Now I don't want you all to worry
          about this no more.  You're making
          more of this than it is.
              (beat)
          You guys have had a tough couple of
          days with the vandalism to the
          crops and the death of your
          shepherd.
              (beat)
          Maybe you guys should do something
          fun?  Let me worry about this
          person.  Let me find out who it is
          and then -- What the hell are you
          people looking at?

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.

A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE
FIELD.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          I'll be damned.

                    GRAHAM
          Turn up the volume Bo.

Bo gets up.

                    BO
          I can't find the remote.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

                    TV ANCHOR
          -- images were shot yesterday
          afternoon by a thirty-four year old
          local camera man in Kerala, a
          southern city of India.  It is the
          eighteenth reported crop circle
          found in that country in the last
          seventy-two hours.

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

                    PROFESSOR (TV)
          Crop circles first emerged in the
          late seventies with the renewed
          interest in extraterrestrial life. 
          They died out by the early
          eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. 
          This new resurgence is wholly
          different.  Elements of it are
          unexplainable.  The speed and the
          quantity in which it has appeared
          implies the coordination of
          hundreds of individuals over many
          countries...
              (beat)
          There is only a limited amount of
          explanations.  Either this is one
          of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
          created, or basically...
              (beat)
          It's for real.

Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes
in deeply.

                    MORGAN

          Extraterrestrials.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What in God's name is going on?

Beat.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the
television screen.

EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY

The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I
          can't think straight right now. 
          I'm going back to the station. 
          Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
          try to think clear.  After that I
          might make some calls.
              (beat)
          Hoaxes... People got way too much
          time on their hands.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          But I'll tell you something, what I
          said in their, still goes.  You and
          your family have been through a lot
          in the last two days... Not to
          mention what happened to you all
          seven months ago.

                    GRAHAM
          Six months.

Edgar stares at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          And three weeks.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          It's left its mark still.  The last
          thing these children need to do, is
          worry about some crazy things
          happening in the world.  Take them
          into town.  Get their minds -- your
          mind, on everyday things.  It's
          good medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          It's good advice...
              (beat)
          Say hi to Marcia for me.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          You take care of yourself...

Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back.

Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

                    GRAHAM
          No radio either... Just for a
          while.

Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.

Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet

Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill
puts change in the meter.

Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.

                    MORGAN
          Book money.

Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he
reaches into his back pocket.

                    GRAHAM
          Only one.

Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
and walks down the sidewalk.

Graham watches them turn into a store.

Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he
walks away.

Graham turns and calls after him.

                    GRAHAM

Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking.

A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS.
NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their
counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE
TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES
SURROUND A CIRCLE.

Morgan steps up to the counter.

                    MORGAN
          Extraterrestrials?

                    MR. NATHAN
          That's what they keep alluding to. 
          It's just a bunch of crock. 
          They're trying to sell sodas, plain
          and simple.  I've been watching
          these reports since morning.  I've
          seen twelve soda commercials so
          far.  Twelve!

                    MORGAN
          Do you have book on

                    MR. NATHAN
          Don't tell me you believe this
          horse manure?

Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          As a matter of fact, I think we
          have one.  Came by mistake in a
          shipment.  Decided to keep it for
          city people.

Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham waits at a white counter.  A gum chewing PHARMACIST in
her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,
glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to
the radio.

                    RADIO HOST (V.O.)
          Why is no one saying the obvious? 
          This is just a rash case of
          copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does
          the first one.  It's on TV, it's on
          the internet.  In less than an hour
          a couple hundred people get the
          same brilliant idea and here we
          are... on the verge of mass
          hysteria.

                    PHARMACIST
          It was asthma medicine right
          Father?

                    GRAHAM
          For Morgan Hess.  And it's not
          Father anymore.

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on
the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with
the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I ask you a favor Father?

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

                    PHARMACIST
          Can I take confession with you?

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
          reverend -- anymore.  I haven't
          been for six months.  You know
          this.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

                    TRACEY
          All this stuff on TV...
              (beat)
          Joe Gills was in here talking about
          the end of the world... I'm just a
          little scared.
              (beat)
          Please.  I need to take confession
          with you.

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales
slowly.

INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small
storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
out some forms.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I got it figured.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

                    MERRILL
          You do?

                    CREWCUT GUY
          I've had two separate folks tell me
          they think there are strangers
          around these parts the last couple
          of nights.  Can't tell what they
          look like, cause they're staying in
          the shadows -- covert like.  No
          one's got hurt mind you... And
          that's the give away.

                    MERRILL
              (doesn't see)
          I see.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          It's called probing.  It's a
          military procedure.  You send a
          reconnaissance group, very small,
          to check out things.  Not to
          engage, but to evaluate the
          situation.  Evaluate the level of
          danger.  Make sure things are all
          clear...

                    MERRILL
          Clear for what?

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          ... For the rest of them.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy
smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

                    MERRILL
          You have a pamphlet or something I
          can read?

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the
top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Hey you didn't used to play
          baseball did you?

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill
          Hess.  I was there that day you hit
          that five hundred and eighty seven
          footer over the left field wall and
          set the record.  That thing had a
          motor on it... It's still the
          record right?

Merrill not, "yes."

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          I got the bat at home... On the
          wall.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You got two minor league home run
          records don't you?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Five.  The five longest.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          Boy, why aren't you in the pros
          making stacks of cash and getting
          handfuls of T and A?

                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
          Cause he also has the minor league
          strike out record.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
the folding table.

                    MERRILL
          Hello Lionel.

LIONEL smirks.

                    LIONEL
          He'd just swing as hard as he could
          every time.  It didn't matter what
          the coach said, didn't matter who
          was on base, he'd whip that bat
          through the air as hard as he
          could... Looked like a lumber jack
          chopping down a tree.
              (beat)
          Merrill here, struck out more times
          than any two players.

Beat.

                    CREWCUT GUY
          You really hold the strike out
          record?

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like
he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are
soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

                    MERRILL
          Felt wrong not to swing.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and
starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches
and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the

                    GRAHAM
          I suppose it's in its usage.

          That's a curse.

Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. 
There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan

Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace.

                    BO
          It's contaminated.

MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.

                    MRS. NATHAN
          Carl, there's something wrong with
          our water!

Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.

                    MORGAN
          Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing
          about her drinking water.  She's
          had it her whole life.  Like a tick
          people have.  Except it's not a

                    MRS. NATHAN
              (fascinated)
          Is that right?

Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with
the other glass.

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan
points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on.

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on. 
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression
too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

          Yeah.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that
he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

          Who is he?

Nobody says anything for the longest time.

                    MORGAN
          He's the man who killed mom.

Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into
the street.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  HESS HOME - AFTERNOON

THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.  The crops sway hypnotically in a
gentle breeze.

The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.  It comes
to a stop in front of the house.  The engine goes off.  No
one gets out.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

All four sit quietly not getting out.

A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor
out of his jacket.  He holds it in his lap.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          What if Bo's baby monitor is
          picking up signals from the
          extraterrestrials?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          All this crop stuff.  They did it
          twenty-five years ago.  It was a
          joke.

THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE.  MORGAN PULLS IT
AWAY FROM HIS EAR.

                    GRAHAM
          It's just static Morgan.  Turn it
          up and see.

Morgan turns a knob on the side.

THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR.  WE HEAR BEEPS
IN THE STATIC.  THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY
MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.

                    MORGAN
          It's a code.

                    GRAHAM
          Let me see that please.

Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat.  THE BEEPS
COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.

                    MERRILL
          It's noise.

                    GRAHAM
          It's broken Morgan.  It'll just
          keep doing this.
              (beat)
          Let's get out of the car okay?

                    MORGAN
          We might lose the signal.

                    GRAHAM
          We can't just sit in the car in our
          own driveway like this.

                    MERRILL
          We'll look like mental patients.

Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm getting out now.

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before
getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right
after.

OUTSIDE CAR

Graham stands and closes his driver side door.

THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE
STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND
TEXTURE.

                    MORGAN
          Nobody move!

Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. 
Three of the doors are open.

IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

                    MORGAN
          Voices.  Did you hear that?

Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.

                    MORGAN
          Not English though.  You heard the
          voices right Uncle Merrill?

                    BO
          I heard them Morgan.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air
where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to
Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          It's probably picking up another
          baby monitor.

                    MERRILL
          That's right.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE
STATION WAGON.

                    MERRILL
          Let me see it.

Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. 
Merrill reaches for it.

THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH
UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over
the roof of the station wagon.

WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN
QUICKLY FADE AWAY.

                    MORGAN
          It doesn't sound like words.

Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING
FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

Graham looks around at his rapt family.

                    GRAHAM
          See this is why we're not watching
          those news reports.  People get
          obsessed.
              (beat)
          I'm letting go now.

                    BO
          No dad!

                    MORGAN
          Don't do it!

                    MERRILL
          You'll lose the signal!

Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat.

Morgan is the first one to move.

                    MORGAN
          Don't let go.

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan?

                    MORGAN
          It gets clearer, the higher you
          hold it.

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, be careful.

                    MERRILL
          I got him.

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. 
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the
monitor above his head.

THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES
SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN
THE DISTANCE.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND
LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

                    GRAHAM
          Hold on.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes
hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill
holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both
hands.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill you got her.

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him. 
THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

                    MORGAN
          Stop!

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over
his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the
roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor
raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still
on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

THE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND
UPFRONT.  THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          There's two of them talking.

THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND
GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING.  THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED
BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE
TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS
ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.

Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her
arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER
AND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES
ALMOST GONE.

THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST
VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.

Beat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights
are off.  ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S
SPEAKER.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          They hung up.

Graham brings Bo down into his lap.  Morgan takes a seat next
to Merrill on the roof.  The Hess family sits like mental
patients on the top of their station wagon.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - EVENING

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE. 
The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and
the children doing dishes after dinner.

The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.

OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS. 
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
outside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically. 
She keeps looking in our direction.

WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
HOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
dog food and a bowl of water.

We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he
gets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully. 
He places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has
no interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our
direction.

Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BARN - EVENING

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the
dog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes
stay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to
no one.

                    GRAHAM
          You know something?  Even
          entertaining the possibility of
          this for a minute has been
          exciting.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

                    GRAHAM
          I can see how people can get
          carried away with this type of
          thing.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW
BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.

Graham starts toward the crops.

                    GRAHAM
          It's a kind of faith.  It's an
          intoxicating thing to believe in
          something you can't see.

THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and
then steps into the field of

CORN CROPS.

We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.

                    GRAHAM
          You were always good at that...

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham
starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either
side.

                    GRAHAM
          Believing in things you couldn't
          see.
              (beat)
          You would have been the first
          person on that station wagon
          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would
          have been wrestling for that baby
          monitor.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          It'll be secretly kind of sad for
          everybody, when this turns out to
          be -- all just make believe.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY
PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.

                    GRAHAM
              (yelling)
          You're wasting your time here!  I'm
          not going to report this or
          anything you do to me crops, to the
          news or TV or anybody!  You're not
          going to get famous!

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
HIM.

Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.

Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE
BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.

GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS
FAST AND LOUD NOW.

Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands
search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch
the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.  He does.

A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY
WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.

It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get
up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts
running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. 
He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
BEHIND HIM.

Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as
he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

BACKYARD.

Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS
FRANTICALLY.

When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His
shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He
locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing
each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. 
He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't
notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs
one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the
baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the
children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They
follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Let's turn on the TV.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK.  THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN
IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS.  OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.

THE SOUND POPS ON.

                    TV REPORTER
          -- first appeared fifty two minutes
          ago.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS.  WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF
A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY.  THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE
CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.

ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE
ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.

Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
lights.

                    BO
          Fourteen.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
television set.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Mexico City officials as well as
          U.S. officials have confirmed that
          these are not air crafts from
          either government's airforce.  The
          first sighting was made by an Air
          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
          to New York as the unidentified
          crafts entered Mexico City air
          space.  They were not detected by
          radar by either country.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The crazies were right.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
the screen.

                    MORGAN
          We have to tape this...

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

Morgan stares at his sister.

                    MORGAN
              (gravely serious)
          Listen Bo.  This is very important. 
          Everything people have written
          about in science books is going to
          change.  The history of the world's
          future is on the TV right now.  We
          need to record this so you can show
          your children this tape and say you
          were there...
              (beat)
          For your children Bo.

                    BO
          My ballet recital.

                    MORGAN
          Dad!

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

                    MORGAN
          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

                    TV ANCHOR

Beat.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          Told you.

Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That's true.

Merrill looks his brother in the eyes.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Do you think it's a possibility?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          How can you say that?

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          That wasn't the answer you wanted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Can you at least pretend to be like
          you used to be?  Give me some
          comfort?

Beat.  Graham thinks it over.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          ... There are all different ways
          you can tell that there's someone
          really there watching out for us. 
          You see signs.  Sometimes they're
          little ones.  You think of someone. 
          The phone rings.  They're on the
          phone... Sometimes they're big,
          like fourteen lights hovering over
          Mexico City.
              (beat)
          Sure, there are a lot of people
          watching this who think this could
          be a bad thing.  But there are a
          lot of people watching this, who
          think it's a miracle.  A sign of
          God's existence.  It's all in how
          you look at things Merrill.
              (beat)
          What you have to decide is what
          kind of person you are?  Are you
          the type who believes in miracles
          and looks for signs or are you the
          kind who believes, things just
          happen by chance?

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

                    MERRILL
          I was at this party once.  I'm on a
          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was
          just sitting there, looking
          beautiful and staring at me.  I go
          to lean in and kiss her and I
          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I
          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff
          it in my paper cup next to the sofa
          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney
          throws up all over herself.
              (beat)
          I knew the second it happened.  It
          was a miracle.  I could have been
          kissing her when she threw up. 
          That would have scarred me for
          life.  I may never have recovered.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights
          are a miracle.

Graham smiles.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          There you go.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          So which type are you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you feel comforted?

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Yes.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          What does it matter then?

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know what Colleen's last
          words were before they killed her?

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          She said, "See", and then her eyes
          glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
          Merrill to swing away."

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at
his expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Do you know why she said that?

Merrill nods, "No."

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          Because the nerve endings in her
          brain were firing as she died, and
          some random memory of us at one of
          your baseball games popped into her
          head.
              (beat)
          There is no one watching out for us
          Merrill.  We're all on our own.

Graham turns back to the television.  Beat.

THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO
BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is
alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes
stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. 
Graham opens the

CLOSET.

Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

                    MERRILL
          For the kids protection.  All they
          were doing was watching TV from
          five a.m.  I felt like they were
          getting obsessed like you said. 
          They should be playing furry, furry
          rabbit or tea party or something
          right?

                    GRAHAM
          What's furry, furry rabbit?

                    MERRILL
              (points)
          That's a game isn't it?
              (beat)
          Anyway...
              (points at the TV)
          There's been some interesting
          developments.

                    GRAHAM
          What time is it?

                    MERRILL
          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight
shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

                    MERRILL
          But they're not really gone.  We
          just can't see them.  Early this
          morning a bird flew right at the
          area where the lights were hovering
          last night.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

                    MERRILL
          It stopped dead in the air and fell
          straight down.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

                    MERRILL
          They caught it on tape and they've
          been playing it all morning.  They
          found the bird.  His head crushed
          in.  When you see the footage it
          looks like the bird flew into a
          wall in the sky.
              (beat)
          They think they have some invisible
          shield thing going, like an optical
          illusion.

                    GRAHAM
          The bird could have had a heart
          attack and crushed his head when he
          fell.

                    MERRILL
          Already thought of.  Two other
          birds did the same thing an hour
          later.  Not as dramatic.  They
          lived.  But you could see they hit
          something.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
eyes.

                    MERRILL
          They're still there hovering.  In
          fact, some people think there's
          more of them now.  All over the
          place.  Over us even.
              (beat)
          And there's a theory about the crop
          circles now.  They think it could
          be some kind of landmark, visual
          mapping system -- so they can
          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense
          doesn't it?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large
cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. 
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
BEGINNING.

The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A
single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of
the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet
high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them
quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
WINDOW.

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT
ROOM.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have
TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham
stares at his children.

                    MORGAN
          So the aliens can't read our minds.

                    GRAHAM
          Oh.

                    MORGAN
          They tell you everything in this
          book.

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on
the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book
on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          It says they're probably very small
          -- like my height -- because, as
          their brains developed, there was
          no use for physical development. 
          It says they're probably
          vegetarians, because they would
          have realized the benefits of such
          a diet.

                    GRAHAM
          Who wrote this book?

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none
there.

                    MORGAN
          Scientists who have been persecuted
          for their beliefs.

                    GRAHAM
          That means they're unemployed.

Morgan closes the book.

                    MORGAN
          Dad, are you going to be serious?

Bo points at the book.

                    BO
          Yeah, serious.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't know what got into me.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

                    MORGAN
          There are pictures.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

                    MORGAN
          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
          the book --

                    GRAHAM
          Bimboo?

                    MORGAN
          Dad.

                    GRAHAM
          I just asked his name.

                    MERRILL
          You had a tone.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
tone.

                    MORGAN
          He says there are two reasons why
          Extraterrestrials would visit us.

Morgan turns the page.

                    MORGAN
          To make contact in the spirit of
          exploration and furthering the
          knowledge of the universe.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

                    MORGAN
          Or the other reason... They're
          hostile.  They've used up the
          resources on their planet and are
          looking to harvest our planet next.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A
space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
it.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Looks a little like our house
          doesn't it?

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

                    BO
          The same windows.

                    MORGAN
              (soft)
          That's weird.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on
fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three
bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

THE PHONE RINGS.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS
DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes
the book.

                    GRAHAM
          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
          now.  Everybody in this house needs
          to calm down and eat some fruit or
          something.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under
his arm and picks up the phone.

                    PHONE VOICE
          Father.

THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello?

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then
slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. 
Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we
see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves
to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going out for a few minutes. 
          No one leaves this house.  No one.

Merrill nods.

                    MERRILL
          Where are you going?

                    GRAHAM
          Ray Reddy's house.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet
for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

                    MERRILL
          Why?

Graham unlocks the front door.

                    GRAHAM
          I think he just called here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

BLUE SKY -- OUR VIEW MOVES OVER CLOUDS.  WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH SOME KIND OF LENS.

                    BO (O.S.)
          You don't think something bad will
          happen do you Morgan?

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up
on the window seat in his room.

                    MORGAN
          Why, you got one of your feeling
          again?

Bo nods, "Yes."

                    MORGAN
          Is it bad?

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

                    MORGAN
          If it does, I won't let anything
          bad happen to you.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

                    BO
              (soft)
          I don't want you to die.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Who said I was going to die?

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

                    MORGAN
          Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look
          out.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the
telescope.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY

A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the
house.  He looks in a side window.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN
CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS
TOTALLY WRECKED.

Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out
the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          What happened Ray?

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

                    RAY
          I wrote your number down to call
          you.  It's been sitting next to the
          phone for six months.  When I knew
          it was inside the house, I couldn't
          think of any other number to call. 
          I panicked.
              (beat)
          Thank you for coming Father.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          You're welcome Ray.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

                    RAY
          I worked so long that night.  I
          ain't never fallen asleep driving
          before.  And never since.  Most of
          the ride home, there wasn't a car
          insight in either direction.  If
          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It
          had to happen at that right moment. 
          That certain ten-fifteen seconds
          when I passed her walking.  It was
          like it was meant to be.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

                    RAY
          I guess if this is the end of the
          world, I'm screwed right?  People
          who kill Reverends' wives aren't
          exactly ushered to the front of the
          line in heaven.

Ray starts the car.

                    GRAHAM
          Where you going Ray?

                    RAY
          To the lake.  The way I see it, all
          the places marked in the crops and
          such -- none of them are really
          near water.  I figure they don't
          like water.
              (beat)
          Can't be any worse than here.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Ray, did you see one of them?

Ray looks at Graham.

                    RAY
          I'm truly sorry for what I've done
          to you and yours.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. 
He puts the car in drive.

                    RAY
          And don't open my pantry Father.  I
          locked one of them in there.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - DAY

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. 
His eyes are closed.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... The startling footage we're
          about to show you was photographed
          by a forty-two year old Romero
          Valadares.

Merrill's eyes open.

                    TV ANCHOR
          This video was taken yesterday
          afternoon at his son's seventh
          birthday, in the city of Passo
          Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the
          local news bureau there and
          satellited to us a few minutes ago. 
          All initial opinions are; this is
          genuine.

THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.

                    TV ANCHOR
          What you are about to see, may
          disturb you.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
GLASS WINDOW.

THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT
THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A
RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED
BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE
BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.

THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL
AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE
DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a
little towards the television screen.

WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. 
HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING
INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE
IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.

THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.

                    MERRILL
          Move children!  Vamonos!

THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH
THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.

WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW
ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A
SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS
DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
BUILDING.

WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE
LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY
DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.

                    BOY WITH HAT
          Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras
          de ai!  Is behind!

THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES
BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE
ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE
IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.

AND THEN WE SEE IT.

THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-
HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE
WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.

Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. 
The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE
VIDEO.

THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT
REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A
FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE
BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL
WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.

THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE
NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.
IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.

Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL
LIKE CREATURE.  THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE
BRANCHES.  EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES.  THEY MATCH THE BUSHES
WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's
kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned
over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
INSIDE THE PANTRY.

Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
IT'S BEING WALKED ON.

Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. 
Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.

                    GRAHAM
          Hello.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          The police are here... I am with
          them... I am a police officer.
              (beat)
          I just want to talk to you.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          We know all about the hoax.  We
          already took some of your friends
          downtown in the paddy wagon.
              (mouths to himself)
          Paddy wagon?

THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET
RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

                    GRAHAM
          If you tell us your name and why
          you did it, we'll give you the same
          deal we gave the others.  Don't
          throw away your life son.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. 
WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE
CAN'T SEE INTO.

Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet
from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. 
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.

GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE
HARD.

FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN
FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.

GRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON
THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.  SLAM!

WE HEAR AN UNBEARABLY HIGH-PITCHED INHALE SOUND FROM INSIDE
THE PANTRY.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STATION WAGON - DAY

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the
road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Douche bag.

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks
it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          They're skin changes color.  That's
          why we couldn't see him that night.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

                    MORGAN
          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

                    MERRILL
          I'm sorry, what book is this?

                    GRAHAM
          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

                    MORGAN
          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

                    GRAHAM
          What's two?

                    MORGAN
          They win.

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second
step of the stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you think about the idea
          that they don't like places near
          water, and we might be safe from
          them near a lake or something?

                    MORGAN
          Sounds made up.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          We can choose to believe it and
          pack up and leave.
              (beat)
          Or we can stay here.  Board up this
          house.  Hide inside our home and
          wait it out.  Either way, at least
          we'll be together.
              (beat)
          All those in favor of the lake,
          raise your hand.

No one raises their hand.

                    GRAHAM
          All those in favor of home, raise
          your hand.

All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them
and sit in silence.

                    MERRILL
          How do we know boards will do
          anything?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Because, they seem to have trouble
          with pantry doors.

EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. 
He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. 
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.

WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.

Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. 
And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...

THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.

The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.

                    MORGAN
          Come quick!

THE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.

WE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE
SEE THEM.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the
closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH
SUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED. 
OTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE
IS PANIC IN THE AIR.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and
          Jerusalem as the latest to confirm
          the appearance of lights.  There
          are lights in the skies over an
          estimated two hundred and seventy
          four cities.  That total could be
          as high as four hundred within the
          hour.

THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME
VIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN
TWO "V" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.

                    GRAHAM
          They decided to show themselves.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          They think these look like stages
          immediately proceeding an attack
          maneuver.

                    MERRILL
          It's like War of the Worlds.

                    MORGAN
          They think it might happen all at
          once.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second
before starting up again.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Hundreds of thousands have flocked
          to synagogues, churches and
          temples.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in
the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Ground forces are being assembled
          in countries throughout the
          globe...

                    GRAHAM
          I'm going to get back to the
          windows.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She
turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          You guys okay?

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto
trucks on the television.

                    MORGAN
          Some guy had a sign that said it
          was the end of the world.
              (beat)
          Nothing really bad is going to
          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

                    MERRILL
          Don't worry.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

                    MORGAN
          You sure right?

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks
back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He
turns back to the children.

                    MERRILL
          You know about signs Morgan?  Not
          like the ones people write on. 
          It's like if you poured a glass of
          milk and you dropped the glass by
          mistake and broke it before you
          could drink it.  Then you looked at
          the milk carton and saw that the
          milk was spoiled.  They're things
          that happen by chance or luck, but
          make you feel that someone's
          watching out for you.

The children think it over.  Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I once had a bad dream and I
          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the
          table next to my bed and something
          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a
          picture of mom.  She was smiling. 
          It made me feel safe... You mean
          like that?

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          Yeah, like that.
              (beat)
          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think
          there's someone watching out for
          us.  I got to believe he's going to
          make sure we're all right in the
          end.

Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the
door half-way.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep
breaths as everything hits him.

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. 
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

                    MERRILL
          Too many windows in the bedrooms. 
          We don't have enough boards.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          We'll have to board up the bedroom
          doors.

                    MORGAN
          Where are we going to sleep?

                    GRAHAM
          The family room.

Everyone sits quietly for a moment.

                    MORGAN
          What about Isabelle?

                    GRAHAM
          We'll keep her in the garage, after
          dinner.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I'll make sandwiches.

                    BO
          I want spaghetti?

                    MERRILL
          We should eat fast Bo.

                    GRAHAM
          Spaghetti sounds great.

Merrill glances at Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          What do you want, Morgan?

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          Anything?

Graham nods "yes."

                    MORGAN
          French toast... and mashed
          potatoes.

                    GRAHAM
          Now we're talking.
              (beat)
          How about you Merrill?

Graham turns and looks at Merrill.  They stare at each other
quietly.  They have a conversation without words.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Chicken Teriyaki.

                    GRAHAM
          Good choice... I'm going to have a
          cheeseburger with bacon.
              (smiles)
          Extra bacon.

The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back

elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is
somber.  No one is moving.

                    GRAHAM
          What's the matter with everyone? 
          Eat.

No one says anything.  No one eats.

Beat.

                    MORGAN
          I'm scared.

                    BO
          Me too.

                    GRAHAM
          I don't want to hear anymore talk
          like that.  And I don't want to see
          anymore faces like the ones I'm
          looking at.
              (beat)
          We are going to enjoy this meal. 
          Nothing can stop us from enjoying
          this meal!  Enjoy!

Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.

                    GRAHAM
          Stop crying!

                    MORGAN
          Don't yell at her!

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. 
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

                    GRAHAM
          Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
          then I'm going to have some of
          everything.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
in his mouth.  He swallows.

                    GRAHAM
          This tastes so great.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows
hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. 
More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He
leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's
fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's
shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
table.  Beat.

THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.

Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED
LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. 
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and
into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. 
He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A
LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. 
THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE
SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children
are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          It's happening.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards
to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is
open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his
bedroom

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same
one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light
breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the
top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE
TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. 
ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES
MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES
THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...
TEN...

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
bedroom.

                    MERRILL
          Graham hurry.

Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in
the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the
bedroom door behind him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer
and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are
standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds
Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you what everyone
          said when you were born, Bo?

Bo nods "no" lightly.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out of your momma and you
          didn't even cry.  You just opened
          your eyes and looked around at
          everybody.  Your eyes were so big
          and gorgeous, the ladies in the
          room gasped.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

                    GRAHAM
          They literally gasped.
              (Graham gasps like them)
          Then they go, "She's like an
          angel."  They said, "We've never
          seen a baby so beautiful."

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill
finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          And you know what else happened?

Bo nods, "no."

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          When they put you on the table to
          clean you up, you looked at me and
          smiled.  They say babies that young
          can't smile... You smiled.

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair
out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. 
Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Let's go down now.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

Graham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. 
Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in
a tight group.

THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot about Isabelle.

ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN
AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY
STOPS.

THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Should we turn off the lights?

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          They already know we're here.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF
WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.

THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.

SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL
NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.

                    MORGAN
              (almost inaudible)
          Dad --

THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

                    GRAHAM
          Do you know what happened when you
          were born Morgan?

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

                    GRAHAM
          You came out and your momma kept
          bleeding.  The doctors rushed you
          out of the room before I could even
          see you.

THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.

All four look up.

                    MERRILL
          They're on the roof.

                    GRAHAM
          While they were trying to fix her
          up, all she kept asking about was
          you.

THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.

THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.

Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

                    MERRILL
          They're in the house.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

                    GRAHAM
          I wanted your momma to see you
          first.  She had dreamed about you
          her whole life.
              (beat)
          They waited till she felt better,
          then they brought you in.  They
          placed you right in her arms.  And
          she looked at you.  And you looked
          at her.  You just stared at each
          other for the longest time and then
          she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
          I'm you momma, you look just like I
          dreamed."

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.

The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. 
The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in
the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          The attic door.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is
movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light
right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. 
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door
starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. 
The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few
more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns
red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

                    MERRILL
          This is a very temporary solution.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching
from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he
is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. 
A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
          How temporary?

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

                    MERRILL
          Twenty-two seconds.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its
top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts
rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still
attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches
into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to
Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a
few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

                    GRAHAM
          Let go.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It
connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The
trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. 
THUD.

The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.

Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
THE DOOR.

THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
UPSTAIRS.

Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes
Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
stairs.

ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at
the pile of furniture.

                    MERRILL
          This is going to do nothing.

                    GRAHAM
          We have to go in the basement.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
darkened door at the bottom.

                    MERRILL
          There's no way out of there.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

                    GRAHAM
          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
          Uncle Merrill's arm?

THUD.

                    MERRILL
          Should we make a run for it out the
          back?

                    GRAHAM
          They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to
Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

                    GRAHAM
          He was only a year and half old.

                    MERRILL
              (to Graham)
          What are you doing?

                    GRAHAM
          He was trying to eat a second
          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,
          "No."  He tried to take a bite, so
          I grabbed it.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and
stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

                    GRAHAM
          I must have pulled his arm at an
          awkward angle.  His elbow popped
          right out of the socket.

THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE
CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
HALL.

WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.

                    GRAHAM
          He didn't scream or anything.  His
          arm just flopped to his side and he
          got real still.

                    MERRILL
          They're coming.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

                    GRAHAM
          I held him in my lap in the back
          seat as we drove to the hospital. 
          I couldn't stop crying... We need
          to go into the basement now.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan
and Bo move to their father slowly.

                    GRAHAM
          You know what your Uncle Merrill
          did right after the doctor put his
          arm back in place?  He jumped off
          the table and gave me a hug.  He
          had already forgotten that I was
          the one who hurt him.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for
Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

                    MERRILL
          We won't be able to get out of
          there.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at
his older brother.

                    MERRILL
          I know.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He
watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
it.  Beat.

THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.

The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
CHALK BOARD.

WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE
FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

                    MORGAN
          We forgot our foil helmets!

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

                    GRAHAM
          We need something to wedge against
          the doorknob.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are
cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill
rummages through the shelves frantically.

                    MORGAN
          They'll read our minds!

                    GRAHAM
          You're scaring your sister.

                    BO
          I'm already scared.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill --

                    MERRILL
          I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking
things to the ground.

                    MORGAN
              (to himself)
          They'll know our secret thoughts.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. 
Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push
open.

                    GRAHAM
          Merrill!

                    MERRILL
          Got it!

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. 
It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is
the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

THE BULB SHATTERS.

THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.

                    BO
          Dad!

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING
AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.

CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.

IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.

THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL
AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A
LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.

THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
LESSEN.

Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
FACE.

                    GRAHAM
          Where's Bo?

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,
BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S
HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.

                    BO
          I'm okay.

ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.

HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.

He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound
emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob
and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He
listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          What's happening out there?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (in the dark)
          I can't even imagine.

THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.

                    MORGAN
          I hope they're doing better than we
          are.  We don't even have helmets.

THERE IS A LOUD BANG.

BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.

ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.

BANG.

GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door
and then turns and faces the lights.

                    GRAHAM
          They're just making noises. 
          They're not trying to get in.
              (beat)
          Why are they doing that?

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan
moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

                    MERRILL
          They want our attention on the
          door?

BANG.  A beat of silence.

                    GRAHAM
          They're distracting us?

                    MERRILL
          From what?

                    MORGAN
          The book says they're probably very
          good problem solvers.

                    MERRILL
          What book!

                    MORGAN
          They'll find a way in.

BANG.

                    GRAHAM
          Morgan, give me your flashlight.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it
up.

                    GRAHAM
          Is there an air vent in here?

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The
brothers move in opposite directions.

GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING AS HE MOVES.

MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT
PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.

A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

                    GRAHAM
          I can feel air.

                    MERRILL
          Me too.

THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

                    GRAHAM
          It's getting stronger.

                    MERRILL
          I'm close.

BANG.

THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND
MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.

HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE
TWO LIGHTS.

                    MORGAN
          What?

IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
A BREEZE.

GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.

EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET
OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.

MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S
A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.

WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

                    MERRILL (O.S.)
          Hold the vent!

SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.

                    GRAHAM
          Pull him!

THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS
BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.

BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY
MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.

BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH
ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
THE REST.

MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.

Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his
side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM
AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.

HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S
FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.

GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.

                    GRAHAM
          We don't have his medicine.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
child's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow
          it down together.  Feel my chest. 
          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe
          like me.  Breathe like me.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
and panic.

                    BO
          He can't breathe.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks
into Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I
          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...
          It'll pass.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't do this to me again.  Not
          again.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength
they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up
with water.

Graham's eyes close.

                    GRAHAM
          I hate you.  I hate you...

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

                    GRAHAM
          The fear is feeding it... Don't be
          afraid of what's happening...
          Believe it's going to pass...
          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
          afraid... The air is coming...
          Believe... We don't have to be
          afraid... It's about to pass...
          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
          Here comes the air...

A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE
SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.

                    GRAHAM
          There we go... We don't have to be
          scared at all... We know it'll
          pass.  We believe it... Don't be
          afraid Morgan.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
THROUGH A STRAW.

Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
son.

                    GRAHAM
          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. 
          Together... The air is going in our
          lungs... Together... We're the
          same.  We're the same.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
Graham's.

THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
LABORED BREATHS.

Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          I hate you.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as
father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each
other tight.

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST
IN THEIR THOUGHTS.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          I should save the flashlights.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF
LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.

Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
HER AND MERRILL.

Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the
button.

THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING

WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. 
IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.

                    VOICE
          ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
          Bahrain have also confirmed.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT
OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

                    MERRILL
          I found a pack of light bulbs.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE
VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF
THE RADIO.

                    RADIO VOICE
          ... Parts of China and Northern
          Korea are among the few remaining
          to verify withdrawals.

                    GRAHAM
          They're broadcasting...

                    MERRILL
          It came on about two hours ago. 
          Woke me up.
              (beat)
          We won Graham.

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          It went on all night.  Everywhere. 
          It was completely a ground battle. 
          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see
          them unless you're up close.  A lot
          of people died.  Some from combat. 
          But most from poison gas
          inhalation.  They secrete it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          How many died?

                    MERRILL
          They think over a hundred thousand. 
          They're just estimates.
              (beat)
          But we held strong.

                    GRAHAM
          How do they know it's over?

                    MERRILL
          A mass evacuation by them started
          about eight o'clock this morning. 
          It's eleven now.
              (beat)
          They're leaving.

Beat.

                    MERRILL
          You didn't think we'd make it.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          No.

                    MERRILL
              (low voice)
          Listen, there's things I can take
          and a couple things I can't and one
          of them I can't take, is when my
          older brother --
              (voice cracks)
          -- who is everything I want to be,
          starts losing faith in things.  I
          saw your eyes last night.
              (beat)
          I don't want to ever see your eyes
          like that again, okay?  I'm
          serious.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at
the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Okay.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham
and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. 
He still looks grey.

                    MERRILL
          He's been like that for awhile.  We
          need to get him some medicine.

                    GRAHAM
          Have they said anything about our
          area?

                    MERRILL
          Philadelphia and its outlying
          counties are cleared, but who knows
          for sure?

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham
turns to Merrill.

                    GRAHAM
              (whispers)
          He's not strong enough to fight off
          another attack.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          I know.
              (beat)
          We need to be sure, before we open
          that door Graham.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. 
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across
the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. 
Beat.

He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. 
THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY
ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

                    MERRILL
          That's good enough for me.

                    GRAHAM
          Me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING

DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE
STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill
opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top
and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the
bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in
his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS
OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN
THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

                    GRAHAM
          Get the syringe as well.  We might
          need to give him an epinephrine
          shot.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that
have fallen from the cabinets.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM
WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE
FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

                    BO
          People are dancing.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at
him.

                    GRAHAM
          You want to see it?

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

                    GRAHAM
          I'll bring the TV in here.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CLOSET - MORNING

THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM
AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.

                    TV REPORTER
          Today there are no countries, and
          no races, and no differences -- we
          are all apart of the same --

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
the television cart out into the hall.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful
not to trip it on the carpet.

THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.

Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN
REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.

THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
TELEVISION SCREEN.

The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on
either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. 
His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's
face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we
see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on
the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the
front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his
hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and
Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES
FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.

The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its
fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.

A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.

Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.

GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION
IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          He's reading my --

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE
ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE
REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.

The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is
open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men
look at each other.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          What do you know?

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          There was an accident.  Drunk
          driving.  They weren't sure.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell
          asleep at the wheel.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His
arms rest on his bent knees.

                    GRAHAM
          Is he okay?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes... That's the first thing
          Colleen asked too.

Graham smiles a little smile.

                    GRAHAM
          She's talking... Which ambulance is
          she in?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She's not in an ambulance Father.

                    GRAHAM
          Why not?

                    OFFICER PASKI
          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
          then a tree.  She was pinned
          between the two.

                    GRAHAM
          Pinned?  What does that mean?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          The truck... the truck has severed
          most of her lower half.

                    GRAHAM
          What did you say?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          She won't be saved.  At this point
          she's alive, because the truck is
          holding her together.  She doesn't
          feel much, and she's talking almost
          like normal.  We didn't pull the
          truck out, cause we wanted you to
          come down here to be with her, as
          long as she's awake.  That won't be
          very long.
              (beat)
          Father, you understand what I've
          told you?

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Edgar.
              (he starts crying)
          Is this the last time I'm going to
          talk to my wife?

Beat.

                    OFFICER PASKI
          Yes it is.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He
walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the
side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back
is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.  She is shivering slightly.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          Hi sweetie.

                    GRAHAM
          Hi baby.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

                    COLLEEN
          I was just taking a walk before
          dinner.

                    GRAHAM
          You love walks.

Beat.

                    COLLEEN
          I guess it was meant to be.

Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Does it hurt?

                    COLLEEN
          I don't feel much.

                    GRAHAM
          Good.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts
crying with her.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Morgan to play games --
          it's okay to be silly.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Bo to listen to her
          brother.  He'll always take care of
          her.

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          ... I will.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          ... Tell Graham --

                    GRAHAM
              (crying)
          I'm here.

                    COLLEEN
              (crying)
          Tell him... See.  Tell him to see.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests
on it.  Her eyes are distant.

                    COLLEEN
              (soft)
          And tell Merrill to swing away.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          What?
              (beat)
          Colleen?... Colleen?

WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS
FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING
RELEASED.

THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS
FACE.

THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON
TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
              (soft)
          Swing away, Merrill.

Morgan's face is obscured by gas.

                    GRAHAM
              (loud)
          Merrill.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Swing away.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye
line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn
with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through
the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room
in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop
lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is
the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. 
The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham
picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on
fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles
pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with
the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back
into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's
skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They
stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
all over the family room.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back
door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps
outside.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The
creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of
water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER
HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. 
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to
the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon
cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He
nods.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn. 
His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES
THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF
THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.

THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. 
IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS
ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.

THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A
WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.

Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle
of the bat in his hands.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan
lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with
him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to
Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.
              (beat)
          His lungs were closed.  No poison
          got in... No poison got in.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

                    GRAHAM
          His lungs were closed.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

                    MERRILL
              (soft)
          Graham.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

                    BO
          Daddy.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't touch him.

Bo is crying.

                    MERRILL
          Graham.

                    GRAHAM
          Don't.

Beat.

                    MORGAN'S VOICE
          Dad.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.

                    MORGAN
          Did someone save me?

                    GRAHAM
          Yeah baby.  I think someone did.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We look out through the broken glass of the second story
bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the
single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the
golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass. 
Huddled together in the sunlight.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, 
               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a 
               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, 
               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left 
               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.

               CLOSE ON

               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and 
               the door bursts open.

               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
               the ready in both hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the 
               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, 
               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled 
               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a 
               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...

               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze! FBI!

               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with 
               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his 
               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not 
               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...

               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS

               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use 
               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which 
               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, 
               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW 
               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, 
               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar 
               in these close quarters, but -

               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is 
               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still 
               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one 
               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case 
               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill 
               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal 
               ACTION and SOUND are restored.

                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)
                         Okay, people, good exercise...

               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten.

               PULLING BACK

               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel 
               room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM 
               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-
               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / 
               FBI Academy."

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Starling's reaction time was 
                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in 
                         five.

               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, 
               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. 

               Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her 
               "Hostage" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her 
               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both 
               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of 
               southern accent.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

                                     CLARICE
                              (indicating her gun)
                         Never cock. Just squeeze.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (grins)
                         I love it when you talk dirty.

               As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's 
               little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-
                         Man? She got off four rounds to your 
                         two.

               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her 
               palm.

                                     BRIGHAM
                              (continuing)
                         One hundred reps, each hand, every 
                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief 
                         wants to see you.

               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile 
               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.

               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD

               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He 
               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through 
               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one 
               arm.

               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof 
               vest, follows her worried gaze.

                                     CLARICE
                         What'd I do?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Stay cool. Just remember to call him 
                         "God."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY

               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, 
               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master 
               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Your instructors tell me you're doing 
                         well. Top quarter of the class.

                                     CLARICE
                         I hope so. They haven't posted 
                         anything.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         A job's come up and I thought about 
                         you. Not really a job, more of - an 
                         interesting errand. Walk me to my 
                         car, Starling.

               They begin to cross the academy grounds. A group of trainees 
               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're trying to interview all of the 
                         serial killers now in custody, for a 
                         psychobehavioral profile. Could be a 
                         big help in unsolved cases. Most of 
                         them have been happy to talk to us. 
                         They have a compulsion to boast, 
                         these people... Do you spook easily, 
                         Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You see, the one we want most refuses 
                         to cooperate. I want you to go after 
                         him again today, in the asylum.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who's the subject?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               Clarice stops walking, goes very still. A beat.

                                     CLARICE
                         The cannibal...

               Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad 
                         for the chance, sir, but - why me?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're qualified and available. And 
                         frankly, I can't spare a real agent 
                         right now.

               He walks on again, at a faster clip. She hurried to keep up.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I don't expect him to talk to you, 
                         but I have to be able to say we 
                         tried... Lecter was a brilliant 
                         psychiatrist, and he knows all the 
                         dodges.
                              (hands her the manila 
                              envelope)
                         Dossier on him, copy of our 
                         questionnaire, special ID for you... 
                         If he won't talk, then I want straight 
                         reporting. How's he look, how's his 
                         cell look, what's he writing? The 
                         Director himself will see your report, 
                         over your own signature - if I decide 
                         it's good enough. I want that by 
                         0800 Wednesday, and keep this to 
                         yourself.

               They're reached his car. His driver stamps on a cigarette, 
               climbs in behind the wheel. BURROUGHS, his assistant, says 
               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. 
               But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. His 
               intensity is scary.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Now. I want your full attention, 
                         Starling. Are you listening to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. 
                         Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go 
                         over the physical procedures used 
                         with him. Do not deviate from them, 
                         for any reason. You tell him nothing 
                         personal, Starling. Believe me, you 
                         don't want Hannibal Lecter inside 
                         your head... Just do your job, but 
                         never forget what he is.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit unnerved)
                         And what is that, sir?

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Oh, he's a monster. A pure 
                         psychopath...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE 
               CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               CLOSE ON an ID card held in a male hand. Clarice's photo, 
               official-looking graphics. It calls her a "Federal 
               Investigator."

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         It's so rare to capture one alive. 
                         From a research point of view, Dr. 
                         Lecter is our most prized asset...

               DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks up from her card. A smarmy little 
               peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, 
               hopeless letch for Clarice. He smiles, stroking her card 
               with his beloved gold pen.

                                     CHILTON
                         You know, we get a lot of detectives 
                         here, but I must say, I can't ever 
                         remember one so attractive...

               NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE

               now wearing a more feminine skirt suit. Hair neatly coiled, 
               elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. He has rudely left her 
               standing.

                                     CHILTON
                         Will you be in Baltimore overnight...? 
                         Because this can be quite a fun town, 
                         if you have the right guide.

               Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. 
                         Chilton, but my instructions are to 
                         talk to Lecter and report back this 
                         afternoon.

                                     CHILTON
                              (pause, sourly)
                         I see.
                              (beat)
                         Let's make this quick, then. I'm 
                         busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY

               Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate CLANGS shut behind 
               her, the bolt shooting home. Chilton walks ahead of her.

                                     CHILTON
                         Lecter carved up nine people - that 
                         we're sure of - and cooked his 
                         favorite bits. We've tried to study 
                         him, of course - but he's much too 
                         sophisticated for the standard tests. 
                         And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm 
                         his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, 
                         isn't he? Using you.

                                     CLARICE
                         How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?

                                     CHILTON
                         A pretty young woman, to turn him 
                         on? I don't believe Lecter's ever 
                         seen a woman in eight years. And oh, 
                         are you ever his "taste" - so to 
                         speak.

                                     CLARICE
                         I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. 
                         It's not a charm school.

                                     CHILTON
                         Good. Then you should be able to 
                         remember the rules.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY

               A darker, even grimmer area. Heavy grids over the lights. 
               Distant SLAMMINGS and faint, hoarse SHOUTS. They walk briskly.

                                     CHILTON
                         Do not reach through the bars, do 
                         not touch the bars. You pass him 
                         nothing but soft paper - no pens or 
                         pencils. No staples or paperclips in 
                         his paper. Use the sliding food 
                         carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept 
                         anything he attempts to hold out to 
                         you. Do you understand me?

                                     CLARICE
                         I understand.

                                     CHILTON
                         I'm going to show you why we insist 
                         on such precautions... On the 
                         afternoon of July 8, 1981, he 
                         complained of chest pains and was 
                         taken to the dispensary. His 
                         mouthpiece and restraints were removed 
                         for an EKG. When the nurse bent over 
                         him, he did this to her...

               He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, 
               she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton.

                                     CHILTON
                         The doctors managed to re-set her 
                         jaw, more or less, and save one of 
                         her eyes. His pulse never got over 
                         eighty-five, even when he ate her 
                         tongue.
                              (pauses, he smiles)
                         I keep him in here.

               He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, 
               and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an 
               anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, 
               tranquilizer guns.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quickly blocking him)
                         Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're 
                         his enemy - as you've said - then 
                         maybe I'll have more luck by myself. 
                         What do you think?

                                     CHILTON
                              (annoyed)
                         You might have suggested that in my 
                         office, and saved me the time.

                                     CLARICE
                         But then I would've missed the 
                         pleasure of your company.

               She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching.

                                     CHILTON
                         When she's finished, bring her out.

               He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't 
                         get near the bars?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaking his hand)
                         Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.

                                     BARNEY
                         Okay. Past the others, it's the last 
                         cell. Stay to the middle. I put out 
                         a chair for you.

               Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.

                                     BARNEY
                         I'm watching. You'll do fine.

               Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, 
               takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to 
               her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some 
               are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, 
               barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a 
               dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, 
               his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.

                                     DARK FIGURE
                         I c-can sssmell your cunt!

               Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.

               DR. LECTER'S CELL

               is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall 
               is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted-
               down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, 
               extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European 
               cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon.

               Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears 
               her throat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice 
                         Starling. May I talk with you?

               Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, 
               reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face 
               so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for 
               the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, 
               crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice 
               is cultured, soft.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good morning.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               as Clarice comes a measured distance closer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Doctor, we have a hard problem in 
                         psychological profiling. I want to 
                         ask for your help with a 
                         questionnaire.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "We" being the Behavioral Science 
                         Unit, at Quantico. You're one of 
                         Jack Crawford's, I expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         I am, yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         May I see your credentials?

               Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, 
               holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Closer, please... Clo-ser...

               She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's 
               nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. 
               Then he smiles, glancing at her card.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (continuing)
                         That expires in one week. You're not 
                         real FBI, are you?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm - still in training at the 
                         Academy.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         We're talking about psychology, 
                         Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide 
                         for yourself whether or not I'm 
                         qualified?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of 
                         you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

               She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely 
               till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Now then. What did Miggs say to you?
                              (she is puzzled)
                         "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. 
                         He hissed at you. What did he say?

                                     CLARICE
                         He said - "I can smell your cunt."

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan 
                         skin cream, and sometimes you wear 
                         L'Air du Temps, but not today. You 
                         brought your best bag, though, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         It's much better than your shoes.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe they'll catch up.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no doubt of it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shifting uncomfortably)
                         Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the 
                         Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

                                     CLARICE
                         All that detail, just from memory...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Memory, Officer Starling, is what I 
                         have instead of view.

               A pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, no, no. You were doing fine, 
                         you'd been courteous and receptive 
                         to courtesy, you'd established trust 
                         with the embarrassing truth about 
                         Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue 
                         into your questionnaire. It won't 
                         do. It's stupid and boring.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm only asking you to look at this, 
                         Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed 
                         if he's recruiting help from the 
                         student body. Busy hunting that new 
                         one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty 
                         boy! Did Crawford send you to ask 
                         for my advice on him?

                                     CLARICE
                         No, I came because we need -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How many women has he used, our Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                         Five... so far.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         All flayed...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's 
                         an active case, I'm not involved. If -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you know why he's called Buffalo 
                         Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't 
                         say.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll tell you if you'll look at this 
                         form.
                              (he considers, then 
                              nods)
                         It started as a bad joke in Kansas 
                         City Homicide. They said... this one 
                         likes to skin his humps.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Witless and misleading. Why do you 
                         think he takes their skins, Officer 
                         Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

                                     CLARICE
                         It excites him. Most serial killers 
                         keep some sort of trophies.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I didn't.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. You ate yours.

               A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Send that through.

               She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray. 
               He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, Officer Starling... do you think 
                         you can dissect me with this blunt 
                         little tool?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

               Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG 
               that makes her start. His voice remains a pleasant purr.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...? 
                         You know what you look like to me, 
                         with your good bag and your cheap 
                         shoes? You look like a rube. A well-
                         scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, 
                         taste... Good nutrition has given 
                         you some length of bone, but you're 
                         not more than one generation from 
                         poor white trash, are you Officer 
                         Starling...? That accent you're trying 
                         so desperately to shed - pure West 
                         Virginia. What was your father, dear? 
                         Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of 
                         the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the 
                         boys found you! All those tedious, 
                         sticky fumblings, in the back seats 
                         of cars, while you could only dream 
                         of getting out. Getting anywhere -
                         yes? Getting all the way - to the 
                         F...B...I.

               His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart. But 
               she squares her jaw and won't give ground.

                                     CLARICE
                         You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are 
                         you strong enough to point that high-
                         powered perception at yourself? How 
                         about it...? Look at yourself and 
                         write down the truth.
                              (she slams the tray 
                              back at him)
                         Or maybe you're afraid to.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're a tough one, aren't you?

                                     CLARICE
                         Reasonably so. Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And you'd hate to think you were 
                         common. My, wouldn't that sting! 
                         Well you're far from common, Officer 
                         Starling. All you have is the fear 
                         of it.
                              (beat)
                         Now please excuse me. Good day.

                                     CLARICE
                         And the questionnaire...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A census taker once tried to test 
                         me. I ate his liver with some fava 
                         beans and a nice chianti... Fly back 
                         to school, little Starling.

               He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as 
               still and remote as a statue. Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, 
               then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the 
               questionnaire in his tray. But after just a few steps, as 
               she passes -

               MIGG'S CELL

               She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.

                                     MIGGS
                         I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee! 
                         S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?

               The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -

               CLARICE

               is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with 
               pale droplets of semen. She gives a little cry, touching her 
               fingers to the wetness. Stunned, near tears, she forces 
               herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue. 
               From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Officer Starling... Officer Starling!

               Clarice slows, stops. She shudders, but makes the very 
               difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of -

               DR. LECTER

               Who's shivering with rage. For an instant his face opens, 
               and we catch a glimpse into hell itself. Then he's composed 
               again.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I would not have had that happen to 
                         you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably 
                         ugly to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then please - do this test for me.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. But I will make you happy... 
                         I'll give you a chance for what you 
                         love most, Clarice Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         What's that, Dr. Lecter?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Advancement, of course.
                              (beat)
                         Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an 
                         old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... 
                         Now go. Go.
                              (a smile)
                         I don't think Miggs could manage 
                         again so soon, even if he is crazy - 
                         do you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice 
               rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost 
               stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, 
               and finally, with some relief, spots -

               HER CAR

               an old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR...

               CLOSE ON

               her face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND 
               her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye -

               IN FLASHBACK

               a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year 
               old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the 
               front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -

               MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV

               a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, 
               Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, 
               and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, 
               seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...

               THE YOUNG CLARICE

               rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning 
               her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing 
               both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -

               THE ADULT CLARICE

               alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face 
               is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - 
               a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling 
               headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at

               A MOVING TARGET

               The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, 
               tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target 
               stops, quite close to her, still swaying.

               Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then 
               she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S 
               FOREHEAD.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. 
               Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New 
               Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.

               Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, 
               carrying an armful of books.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, Ardelia.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia 
               past high metal bookstacks.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You missed Fourth Amendment law. 
                         Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. 
                         Where were you all afternoon?

                                     CLARICE
                         Pleading with a crazy man, with come 
                         all over my face.

               Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn. Wish I had time for a social 
                         life.

               Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting 
               on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Mr. Crawford?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

               Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- 
               lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of 
               Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I've read your interim memo on Lecter. 
                         You sure you've left nothing out?

               INTERCUTTING

                                     CLARICE
                         It's all there, sir, practically 
                         verbatim.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit heatedly)
                         Right down to the kleenex I used.
                              (he is silent)
                         Sir, why? Is something wrong?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He mentioned a name, at the very 
                         end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

                                     CLARICE
                         I spent all evening on the mainframe. 
                         Lecter altered or destroyed most of 
                         his patient histories, prior to 
                         capture. No record of anyone named 
                         Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like 
                         it might have have something to do 
                         with divorce. I tracked it down in 
                         the library's catalogue of national 
                         yellow pages.
                              (glancing at her notes)
                         It's a mini-storage facility outside 
                         Baltimore, where Lecter had his 
                         practice.

               She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her 
               cleverness.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well? Why aren't you there right 
                         now?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, that's a field job. It's outside 
                         the scope of my assignment. And I've
                         got a test tomorrow on -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Do you recall my instructions to 
                         you, Starling? What were they?

                                     CLARICE
                         To complete and file my report by 
                         0800 Wednesday. But sir -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Then do that, Starling. Do just 
                         exactly that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, what is it? There's something 
                         you're not telling me.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Miggs has been murdered.

                                     CLARICE
                              (startled, upset)
                         Murdered...? How?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The orderly heard Lecter whispering 
                         to him, all afternoon, and Miggs 
                         crying. They found him at bed check. 
                         He'd swallowed his own tongue... 
                         Chilton is scared stiff the family 
                         will file a civil rights lawsuit, 
                         and he's trying to blame it on you. 
                         I told the little prick your conduct 
                         was flawless.
                              (beat)
                         Starling...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know 
                         how to feel about it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You don't have to feel any way about 
                         it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. 
                         Why not, what can they do? Take away 
                         his books for awhile, and no jello...
                              (a bit softer)
                         I know it got ugly today. But this 
                         is your report, Starling - take it 
                         as far as you can. On your own time, 
                         outside of class. Now carry on.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               as we hear the loud CLICK of Crawford hanging up. She stares 
               at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well God damn it! You old creep. 
                         Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs 
                         squirt you and see how you like it.

               She slams her receiver into its cradle.

               ANGLE ON CRAWFORD

               as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. He leaves 
               his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his 
               slippers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, 
               as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'll take over, Patricia. You get 
                         some rest.

               The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes. He glances at 
               it, then sets it aside. He crosses to -

               BELLA CRAWFORD

               who lies in an elevated hospital bed. Nearby are an oxygen 
               tank and mask, floral arrangements. Her breathing is shallow, 
               very labored. Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a 
               long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into 
               place, then bends over to kiss her forehead. SOUND UPCUT - 
               THUNDER and RAIN...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)

               An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out 
               location. It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed 
               wire. Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds.

                                     MR. YOW (V.O.)
                         Unit 31 was leased for ten years. 
                         Pre-paid in full... The contract is 
                         in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes 
               a FLASH photo of its sealed padlock. EVERETT YOW, a fat, 
               60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both. He looks 
               unhappy.

                                     CLARICE
                         So no one's been in here since - 
                         1980?

               She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then 
               sets aside both keys and lock.

                                     MR. YOW
                         Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a 
                         great concern to my customers. But, 
                         if you say this is an FBI matter...

                                     CLARICE
                         I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I 
                         promise. Be gone before you know it.

               Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, 
               but the door won't budge. Another tug, harder - no good. Mr. 
               Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck. He 
               sighs.

                                     MR. YOW
                         We could return tomorrow, with my 
                         son. Or perhaps some workmen...?

               Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches 
               in to turn on her headlights. Mr. Yow blinks in the sudden 
               brightness. Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and 
               returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor 
               mat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Would you hold these, please?

               She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on 
               the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the 
               center of the door. She pumps on the jack handle as the door 
               SQUEALS slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 
               inches, despite all her exertions. She spreads out the rubber 
               mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr. Yow, then 
               lies on the mat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice, backlit, peers under the door. She reaches in, makes 
               a sweep with her flashlight. We catch shadowy outlines - 
               boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...

               SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small 
               RUSTLINGS. Mr. Yow's chubby face appears down beside 
               Clarice's.

                                     MR. YOW
                         It smells like mice... I think I 
                         hear them, too - don't you?

               Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.

                                     MR. YOW
                         You're going in there?

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her 
               camera from him. She hands him a card, trying to appear 
               nonchalant.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow, if this door should fall
                         down -ha ha! - or anything else - 
                         would you be kind enough to call 
                         this number? It's our Baltimore field 
                         office. They know you're here with 
                         me... Do you understand?

                                     MR. YOW
                         Might I suggest tucking your pants 
                         into your socks? To prevent mouse 
                         intrusion.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Good idea.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As 
               she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal 
               edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight 
               on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Okay, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay, Mr. Yow...

               She shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see -

               CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING

               spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... 
               a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long 
               and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying 
               of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam 
               capturing... an old upright piano.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         That wasn't me.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh.

               Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, 
               but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away 
               cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, 
               she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending 
               with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, 
               she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting 
               clouds of dust make her cough.

               THE CAR

               is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite 
               the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, 
               but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.

               CLARICE

               peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.

               HER POV - SHIFTING

               as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... 
               as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled 
               lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, 
               high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin 
               evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.

               Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks 
                         like somebody is sitting in this 
                         car.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better 
                         come out now, Miss Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet! - just wait for me.
                              (under the breath)
                         Maybe in about two seconds.

               She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the 
               gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front 
               door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle 
               of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. 
               She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends 
               the tip into a hook.

               CLOSE ANGLE

               as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back 
               passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the 
               inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.

               Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't 
               open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her 
               flashlight.

               HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM

               revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in 
               white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other 
               atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands 
               of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white 
               neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head.

               CLARICE

               sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then 
               very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by 
               the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases 
               herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK 
               loudly.

               ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. 

               Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. 
               She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic 
               elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as 
               she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening 
               bag's drawstring.

               A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded 
               material slides away.

               Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart-
               pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more 
               closely.

               The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory 
               specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, 
               by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, 
               into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared 
               badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.

               CLARICE

               staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself 
               quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas 
                         anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)

               A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates 
               the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs 
               through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard 
               admits her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)

               On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his 
               arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

               PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on 
               the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been 
               stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.

                                     CLARICE
                         Hester Mofet... "The rest of me." 
                         Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you 
                         rented that place.

               HER POV

               he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. He doesn't respond.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.

                                     CLARICE
                         You put those - things in there. 
                         Paid for it in advance, ten years 
                         ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?

               The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making 
               her jump up. In its tray is a clean, folded white towel. She 
               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               She sits again, rubbing her wet hair. When he finally speaks, 
               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the 
               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your bleeding has stopped.

                                     CLARICE
                         How did -
                              (she stops herself)
                         It's nothing. A scratch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why don't you ask me about Buffalo 
                         Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised, a beat)
                         Why? Do you know something about 
                         him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I might if I saw the case file. You 
                         could get that for me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Why don't you tell me about "Miss 
                         Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. 
                         Or do I have to wait for the lab?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sighs)
                         His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A 
                         former patient of mine, whose romantic 
                         attachments ran to, shall we say, 
                         the exotic...? I didn't kill him, 
                         merely tucked him away. Very much as 
                         I found him, in that ridiculous car, 
                         in his own garage, after he's missed 
                         three appointments. You'd have him 
                         under "Missing Person" - which, in 
                         poor Raspail's case, could hardly be 
                         more true.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't kill him, then who 
                         did?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who can say...? Best thing for him, 
                         really. His therapy was going nowhere.

                                     CLARICE
                         Wouldn't it have been easier to just 
                         leave him for the police to find?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And have them clomping about in my 
                         life? Oh dear, no... At that time I 
                         still had certain private amusements 
                         of my own.
                              (beat)
                         How did you feel when you saw him, 
                         Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

                                     CLARICE
                         Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Ahhh... Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         Because you weren't wasting my time.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you have something you use, when 
                         you need to get up your courage? 
                         Memories, tableaux... scenes from 
                         your early life?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Next time I'll have to 
                         check.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford is helping your career, 
                         isn't he? Apparently he likes you. 
                         And you like him, too.

                                     CLARICE
                         I never thought about it.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your first lie to me, Clarice. How 
                         sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford 
                         wants you, sexually? True, he's much 
                         older, but - do you think he 
                         visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? 
                         Fucking you?

                                     CLARICE
                         That doesn't interest me, Doctor. 
                         And it's the sort of thing Miggs 
                         would ask.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not anymore.
                              (beat)
                         Surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford 
                         dangles you before me. Then I give 
                         you a bit of help. Do you think it's 
                         because I like to look at you, and 
                         imagine how good you would taste...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Is it?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Or doesn't this all begin to suggest 
                         to you a kind of... negotiation? 
                         There's something Crawford can give 
                         me, and I want to trade for it. I 
                         even wrote to him, offering my help. 
                         But he hates me, so he won't deal 
                         directly.

               Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. As his 
               lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. Gone 
               are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. 
               She stands, too, startled. They face each other.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just 
                         like that gospel program. When you 
                         leave, they'll turn the volume way 
                         up. Chilton does enjoy his petty 
                         torments.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You 
                         know, don't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've been in this room for eight 
                         years, Clarice. I know they will 
                         never, ever let me out while I'm 
                         alive. What I want is a view. I want 
                         a window where I can see a tree, or 
                         even water. I want to be in a federal 
                         institution, away from Chilton - and 
                         I want a view. I'll give good value 
                         for it. Crawford could do that for 
                         me, but he won't. You persuade him.

                                     CLARICE
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Who killed your patient?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you 
                         and Jack Crawford are most anxious 
                         to meet.

                                     CLARICE
                         Buffalo Bill...?
                              (incredulous)
                         Bill killed him, all those years 
                         ago...? That's impossible.

               But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who is he stalking right now, Clarice? 
                         I wonder, don't you? How many more 
                         young women will have to die, before 
                         you trade with me...?

               As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - 
               NIGHT

               CATHERINE MARTIN takes a long toke from a bong pipe. She is 
               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown 
               fair. Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, CODY; they're 
               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished 
               apartment. The TV in on, with low SOUND.

                                     CATHERINE
                         This stuff's givin' me the munchies. 
                         Where's that bag of popcorn?

                                     CODY
                         Shit. Left the groceries in the car.

               He starts to rise, but she pushes him back.

                                     CATHERINE
                         'S okay, I'll go.

               She rises, goes out the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

               Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting 
               her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away -

               A MAN

               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His 
               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, 
               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked 
               nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast-
               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 

               Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Help you with that?

                                     MAN
                         Would you? Thanks.

               His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on 
               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't 
               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above 
               average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, 
               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Let's slide it up, you mind?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT

               He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, 
               and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after 
               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.

                                     MAN
                         Are you about a size 14?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (surprised)
                         What?

               Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of 
               her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding 
               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his 
               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, 
               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. 
               He bends over her face with the lamp.

               We hear her shallow BREATHING.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size 
               tag.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of 
               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no 
               bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.

                                     MAN
                         Gooood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse 
               is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. 
               The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, 
               partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights 
               shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY

               CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually 
               sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Electron microscopy reveals fiber 
                         "signatures" that are nearly as 
                         distinct as fingerprints...

               Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia 
               is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. 
               Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but 
               straightens, hearing -

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Both of these blouses were worn by 
                         victims of Buffalo Bill. They were 
                         found in two different states, and 
                         four months apart. He always slits 
                         them up the back, like a funeral 
                         suit...

               ON THE SCREEN

               successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we 
               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts 
               match.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         The bunching you see - this 
                         compression - is characteristic of 
                         scissor cuts, rather than a single 
                         blade. And, as you see - Bill always 
                         uses the same pair...

               ANGLE ON THE DOOR

               as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Clarice Starling! Are you in here?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other 
               trainees. He carries a small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Get your field gear, take stuff for 
                         overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where?

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Some fishermen in West Virginia found 
                         an unidentified girl's body. It's a 
                         Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in 
                         the water about a week, and Jack 
                         needs somebody that can print a 
                         floater. Think you can handle it?

                                     CLARICE
                              (thinking quickly)
                         I'll need the big fingerprint kit... 
                         and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-
                         5, with film packs and batteries.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING)

               Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an 
               airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend 
               bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't 
                         he? Impatient...

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         He's got a lot on his mind besides 
                         Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is 
                         real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' 
                         you about it now, 'cause he may never.

               Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, 
               rather dilapidated Beechcraft. Its door is open, the twin 
               props and beacons already turning. Brigham turns to her, 
               holding out his small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         You're goin' in the field, so you 
                         gotta have full kit. Take this - 
                         it's my own...

               Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in 
               its shoulder holster. She looks up at him, touched.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Wear it, don't ever leave it in your 
                         purse. Dry fire it whenever you get 
                         the chance. And do your exercises.

                                     CLARICE
                         I will... I promise.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Listen, I hope you never need a thing 
                         I've taught you. But you've got 
                         something... Jack sees it, I do too. 
                         If you ever need to, you can shoot.

               She nods, climbs out. Then she looks back in at him. They're 
               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Bless you, Starling...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEECHCRAFT PLANE - DAY (FLYING)

               CLARICE'S POV - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far 
               below. Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.

               Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in 
               her lap. The cover reads "Case File: / BUFFALO BILL." Clarice 
               is moody, distracted. She hesitates, then opens the file, 
               begins to scan.

               INSERTS - HER POV

               Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch 
               words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"... 
               Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched 
               grooves... And then a stack of victim photos. The first one, 
               taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, 
               face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.

               Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at 
               the next. It makes her flinch, just slightly. Quickly she 
               turns through several more photographs, trying hard to 
               concentrate.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         He keeps them alive for three days.

               NEW ANGLE

               shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's 
               motion. Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back. 
               Crawford sits, removing sunglasses. He rubs his eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why, we don't yet know... There's no 
                         evidence of rape or physical abuse 
                         prior to death. All the mutilation 
                         you see there is post-mortem.
                              (a beat; he glances 
                              at her)
                         I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's 
                         too damned hot back here...

               The pilot adjusts a valve. Crawford turns to her again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         So. Three days. Then he shoots them,
                         skins them - usually just the torsos - 
                         and dumps them. Each body in a 
                         different river, in a different state, 
                         downstream from an interstate highway. 
                         The water leaves us no fingerprints, 
                         fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence 
                         at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the 
                         first one...

               A COLOR PHOTO - IN CLARICE'S HANDS

               shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school 
               graduation cap and gown. She smiles at us with touching 
               optimism.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         A big girl, like all the rest. Went 
                         about 160... Her corpse was the only 
                         one he took the trouble to weight 
                         down, so actually, she was the third 
                         girl found. After her, he got lazy...

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved. Crawford pulls 
               a map from the file, spreads it out. It shows the central 
               and eastern U.S., with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, 
                         where the Bimmel girl was abducted. 
                         Blue triangle where her body was 
                         found - down here in Missouri. Same 
                         marks for the other four girls, in 
                         different colors. This new one, 
                         today... washed up here.
                              (he marks with a Flair 
                              pen)
                         Elk River, in West Virginia, about 
                         six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

                                     CLARICE
                         There's no correlation at all between 
                         where they're kidnapped and where 
                         they're found...?
                              (he shakes his head)
                         What if - what if you trace the 
                         heaviest-traffic routes backwards 
                         from the dump sites? Do they converge 
                         at all?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea, but he thought of it, 
                         too. We've run simulations, using 
                         different vectors and the best dates 
                         we can assign. You put it all in the 
                         computer, and smoke comes out. No, 
                         this one is different. This one has 
                         seen us coming...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY (DRIVING)

               Crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a 
               winding mountain road. Clarice has the file open on her lap. 
               He glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Talk about him, Starling. Tell me 
                         what you see.

                                     CLARICE
                              (choosing her words 
                              carefully)
                         He's a white male... Serial killers 
                         tend to hunt within their own ethnic 
                         group. And he's not a drifter - he's 
                         got his own house, somewhere. Not an 
                         apartment.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         What he does with them - takes 
                         privacy... Time, tools... He's in 
                         his 30's or 40's - he's got real 
                         physical strength, but combined with 
                         an older man's self-control. He's 
                         cautious, precise, never impulsive... 
                         This won't end in suicide, like they 
                         often do.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                         He's got a real taste for it now. 
                         And he's getting better at his work.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (a beat; impressed)
                         Maybe you've got a knack for this... 
                         I guess we're about to find out.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

               He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                         You haven't said a word today about 
                         that garage. Or what I found there.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What should I say? You did fine work. 
                         We'll wait on the lab.

                                     CLARICE
                         You knew. You knew from the start 
                         that Lecter held the key to this... 
                         But you weren't up front with me. 
                         You sent me in to him naked.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Are you finished?

                                     CLARICE
                         He starts this - buzzing in me, in 
                         my head. He makes me feel violated... 
                         You used me, Mr. Crawford.

               A shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers 
               sternly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number One. Maybe there's a 
                         connection, maybe not. Lying and 
                         breathing are the same thing to 
                         Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you 
                         in there with something to hide from 
                         him, he'd have known it, instantly. 
                         He'd never have trusted you.

               She starts to answer, then is silent. He is right.

               By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree-
               lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in 
               the background. They slow, turn.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number Three, I didn't bring you 
                         along today just because you can do 
                         first-rate forensics. If Lecter is 
                         becoming part of this case, you've 
                         got the most current read on him. 
                         And Number Four - you don't have to 
                         like me, or the way I do things. But 
                         you do have to keep a cool head. 
                         Especially now... Because from here 
                         on out, you'll know everything I do. 
                         Are we straight on that?

               Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's 
               likely to get. She stares out the windshield.

               JUST AHEAD OF THEM

               the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other 
               police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads 
               "Potter Funeral Home." Two troopers climb from the car.

               Crawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, 
               removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (softly)
                         You think about him long enough, you 
                         get a feel for him... Then, if you're 
                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, 
                         one little part of it tugs at you, 
                         tries to get your attention... You 
                         let me know when that happens, 
                         Starling. Live right behind your 
                         eyes, today. Don't try to impose any 
                         patterns on this guy. Just stay open 
                         and let him show you...

               One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, 
               peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, 
               then turns back to Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         School's out, Starling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY

               SOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint 
               kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing -

               COUNTRY PEOPLE

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing 
               from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance 
               over at her curiously.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense 
               memory is triggered in her...

               IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from 
               the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We 
               Gather...?"

               THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE

               in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. 
               Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

               CHILD'S POV

               on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally 
               she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, 
               his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Starling...?

               NEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY)

               as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. 
               Like her, he carries a large case.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're around back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY

               A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are 
               all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered 
               corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing 
               machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is 
               closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... 
                         This is Officer Starling. We 
                         appreciate your phoning us.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (grim, unsociable)
                         I didn't call you. That was somebody 
                         from the state attorney's office... 
                         'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' 
                         find out if this girl's local. It 
                         could just be somethin' that outside 
                         elements has dumped on us.

               He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well sir, that's where we can help. 
                         If -

                                     SHERIFF
                         I don't even know you, Mister... Now 
                         we'll extend you ever courtesy, just
                         soon as we can, but for right now -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex 
                         crime has some aspects I'd rather 
                         discuss just between the two of us. 
                         Know what I mean?

               He indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, 
               nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, 
               closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there.

               CLARICE

               burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who 
               peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit 
               tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.

               ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR

               as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. 
               The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the 
                         chapel. And tell Lamar to come on 
                         when he's done playin' that music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY

               Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton 
               Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low 
               voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak 
               loudly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, 
                         Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, 
                         Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can 
                         you hear me...?

               He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.

               CLARICE

               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, 
               turning up her natural accent by several notches.

                                     CLARICE
                         Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! 
                         Listen here a minute, please. There's 
                         things I need to do for her...

               WIDER ANGLE

               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies 
               and troopers. They gradually fall silent, looking at her.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         Y'all brought her this far, and I 
                         know her folks would thank you if 
                         they could. Now please - go on out 
                         and let me take care of her... Go 
                         on, now.

               The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin 
               to to file out, whispering among themselves. As they go, a 
               bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on 
               a porcelain embalming table. It is almost the only modern 
               object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets 
               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.

               FAVORING CRAWFORD

               as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect. Men 
               brush by him, till finally only two are left: DR. AKIN, a 
               family g.p., and LAMAR, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. 
               SOUND of the door closing. Lamar dabs around his nostrils 
               with Vicks VapoRub.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone)
                         We're starting. Tell everybody to 
                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.

               CLARICE

               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint 
               kit. She is lifting out a camera when she hears the ZIPPER 
               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...

               One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, 
               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. She blinks at her 
               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, 
               look at the corpse.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; softly)
                         Bill...

               She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a FLASH 
               photo.

               LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP, FROM BENEATH TABLE

               as Dr. Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. 
               A piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged 
               around it, dangling. Crawford leans in for a closer look.

                                     DR. AKIN
                         Wrongful death... She'll have to go 
                         to the state pathologist at Claxton 
                         when you're done.
                              (Crawford nods)
                         I better - get on back for the rest 
                         of that service. Lamar'll help you.
                              (shaken)
                         Lord almighty...

               He leaves, and Clarice leans INTO SHOT, taking another photo.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What do you see, Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, she's not local. Her ears are 
                         pierced three times each, and she's 
                         wearing green glitter nail polish. 
                         Looks like town to me...

               CLOSE ANGLE

               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the 
               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         She waxed her legs, I think... A big 
                         girl, just like the others - but she 
                         was careful about her appearance...

               UPWARD ANGLE AGAIN

               as Lamar joins them for a closer look.

                                     CLARICE
                         Two of the fingernails are broken 
                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under 
                         the others. She tried to claw her 
                         way through something... I'll scrape 
                         out samples after I've printed her.

               She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.

                                     LAMAR
                         Them fishhooks are set too close 
                         together. No wonder the Franklin 
                         boys was scared to say they found 
                         her.

                                     CLARICE
                         Think they were runnin' a trotline?

               Crawford and Lamar both look at her curiously.

                                     CLARICE
                              (to Crawford)
                         It's a Fish and Game violation. Like 
                         poaching. There's a big fine.

                                     LAMAR
                         Right... Are you from around here?

                                     CLARICE
                         They do it lots of places.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll 
                         fax her fingerprints to Washington, 
                         try to trace her through Missing 
                         Persons.

               SIDE ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DEAD GIRL'S FACE

               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. Clarice sets the 
               Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, 
               while Lamar gently retracts the lips. Each time the camera 
               FLASHES, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.

               NEW ANGLE - CHEST HIGH

               as Clarice examines a developing print.

                                     CLARICE
                         She's got something in her throat.

               She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as 
               she searches in her kit.

                                     LAMAR
                         When a body comes out of the water, 
                         alots of times there's like, leaves 
                         and things in the mouth.

               Clarice holds up a pair of forceps. She glances at Crawford, 
               who nods. She bends over, partially OUT OF SHOT, and after a 
               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical 
               object. She turns this in the air, as they all stare.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What is it - some kind of seed pod?

                                     LAMAR
                         Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how 
                         come that to get way down in there? 
                         'Less somebody shoved it in...

               Clarice and Crawford exchange a glance.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She'll be easier to print if we turn 
                         her over. Lamar, will you give me a 
                         hand?

                                     LAMAR
                         Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar 
                         from her kit, carefully drops the 
                         cocoon inside.

               SOUND of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, 
               off screen. She seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Starling - what do you make of these?

               She turns to look.

               HER POV

               low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, 
               triangular patches of skin are missing.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks at Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. I didn't see those on 
                         any of the other girls...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         They weren't there. Get close-ups.

               Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY

               Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. 
               She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of 
               Coke.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

                                     LAMAR
                         No, hold it under your chin, there, 
                         and on your temples. Cold'll make 
                         you feel better. It does me.

               She smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees 
               Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits 
               beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself 
               with the can.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When I told that sheriff we shouldn't 
                         talk in front of a woman, that really 
                         burned you, didn't it?
                              (she is silent)
                         That was just smoke, Starling, I had 
                         to get rid of him. You did well in 
                         there.

                                     CLARICE
                         It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other 
                         cops know who you are. They look at 
                         you to see how to act... It matters.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Point taken.

               She looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When we get back, I want you to run 
                         that bug by the Smithsonian, see if 
                         they can identify it. Maybe it's got 
                         some limited range, or it only breeds 
                         at certain times of year... You found 
                         it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm wondering if he's done that before - 
                         placed a cocoon, or an insect. It 
                         would be easy to miss in an autopsy, 
                         especially with a floater... Can we 
                         check back on that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         The other girls are in the ground. 
                         Exhumations are upsetting for the 
                         families. I'll do it if I have to,
                         but -

                                     CLARICE
                         Then have the lab check Raspail's 
                         head.
                              (he looks at her)
                         Dr. Lecter's patient - have them 
                         probe his soft-palette tissues... 
                         They'll find another cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You seem pretty sure of that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Raspail was killed by the same man 
                         who's killing these girls. And Lecter 
                         knows him. Maybe even treated him... 
                         You think so, too, don't you? Or 
                         you'd never have sent me to that 
                         asylum.

               He looks at her for a moment, then sips again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Before we caught him, Lecter had a 
                         big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. 
                         But he traveled all over the country - 
                         teaching, consulting... Christ, even 
                         testifying in murder trials. Who 
                         knows how many potential psychos he 
                         turned loose, just for the fun of 
                         it...?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               A shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the 
               edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his 
               arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka "Buffalo Bill."

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it 
                         in gooood...

               CATHERINE MARTIN

               looks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the 
               pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit 
               is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, 
               from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's 
               soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle 
               of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister... my family will pay cash. 
                         Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
                         they -

               REVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose 
                         again.

               The little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It 
                         will get the hose!

               SIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM

               as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (under her breath)
                         Oh God... oh God...

               She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the 
               lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister, if you let me go, I won't 
                         press charges, I promise. You've 
                         only had me here a couple days, and -

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         No. Just one day...

                                     CATHERINE
                         Is that all...? See - see, my mom is 
                         a real important woman... Well, I 
                         guess you already know that. She'll 
                         pay you, no questions asked. Whatever 
                         cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - 
                         she'll see that -

               A sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, 
               shielding her eyes.

               HER POV

               a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Put the bottle in the basket. No 
                         funny business, or you'll be sorry...

               NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE

               as the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips 
               the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe 
               of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to 
               scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand 
               hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on 
               the concrete walls, all around her -

               BLOODY FINGER TRACKS

               dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - FBI ACADEMY - DAWN

               Clarice is at her desk, exercising her right hand with the 
               grip flexer, while simultaneously studying a thick law book. 
               Ardelia sticks her head in the door, excited.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You better come see this.

               CLOSE ON a TV screen, filled with a photo of Catherine Martin.

                         ...was listed at first simply as a 
                         missing person, but is now believed 
                         to have been kidnapped by the serial 
                         killer known only as "Buffalo Bill."

               The photo disappears, replaced by the TV ANCHOR himself.

                         the missing girl's blouse has been 
                         identified, sliced up the back, in 
                         what has become a kind of grim calling 
                         card. Young Catherine Martin, as 
                         we've said, is the only daughter of 
                         U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -

               CLARICE

               looks at Ardelia, surprised. Other trainees are drifting 
               into the rec room, some whispering among themselves. Clarice 
               stares back at the TV intently.

                                     TV ANCHOR (O.S.)
                         ...the Republican junior senator 
                         from Tennessee. And while her 
                         kidnapping is not at this point 
                         considered to be politically 
                         motivated, nevertheless it has stirred 
                         the government -

                         and I quote, "intensely concerned." 
                         Just moments ago, Senator Martin 
                         made this dramatic personal plea...

               SENATOR MARTIN (TV FOOTAGE)

               fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to 
               a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her 
               Georgetown home. A tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, 
               taut face.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         I'm speaking now to the person who 
                         is holding my daughter. Her name is 
                         Catherine... You have the power to 
                         let Catherine go, unharmed. She's 
                         very gentle and kind - talk to her 
                         and you'll see. Her name is 
                         Catherine...

               Clarice is moved by what she sees. Other trainees are all 
               around her.

                                     CLARICE
                              (whispers)

                         Why does she keep repeating the name?

                         Somebody's coaching her... They're 
                         trying to make him see Catherine as 
                         a person - not just an object.

               ON THE TV AGAIN

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have a chance to show the whole 
                         world that you can be merciful, as
                         well as strong. Please - I beg you - 
                         release my Catherine...

               NEW FOOTAGE

               as we see (NIGHT, TELEPHOTO) - a taped-off section of 
               Catherine's parking lot. Technicians, with instruments, are 
               kneeling by the crushed grocery bag.

               Catherine's apartment, followed by Burroughs and other agents. 
               One of them moves quickly towards the CAMERA, waving it back.

               as the other trainees send up a brief, ironic cheer. But 
               Ardelia turns sympathetically towards the troubled Clarice.

                                     ARDELIA
                         I don't know whether to say "I'm 
                         sorry," or "Congratulations." But 
                         girl? - you just went prime time.

                         Senator's child. She's a big girl, 
                         Starling, like all the rest. We're 
                         going on the theory she was randomly 
                         targeted by size...

               blank eye sockets, gaping fangs.

                         By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours. 
                         That leaves us just 36 more, before 
                         he kills her... But maybe, just maybe, 
                         Starling, we caught a real break 
                         this time - thanks to you.

                         does that count?

               They look up, delighted to see Clarice in the doorway. Both 
               men are hopelessly smitten by her.

                                     RODEN
                         Of course it counts. How do you play?

                                     PILCHER
                              (grins)
                         Officer Starling. Welcome back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ENTOMOLOGY CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a 
               hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. 
               Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box.

                                     RODEN
                         Where the hell did this one come 
                         from? It's practically mush.

                                     CLARICE
                         You really don't want to know.

                                     PILCHER
                         Your West Virginia specimen gave us 
                         quite a bit of trouble, but I finally 
                         managed to narrow his species through 
                         chaetaxy - studying the skin.

                                     RODEN
                         I'm the one who found his perforating 
                         proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, 
                         right now?
                              (Clarice nods)
                         Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY - DAY

               VERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden 
               uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden 
               chrysalis.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         The whole trick is to remove the 
                         chrysalis without destroying it... 
                         The wings are just like wet tissue 
                         paper...

               THE TWO MEN

               are hunched over a formica table, peering through square 
               magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. 
               Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better 
               condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on 
               towel paper.

                                     PILCHER
                              (without looking up)
                         What do you do when you're not 
                         detecting, Officer Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

                                     PILCHER
                         Ever get out for cheeseburgers and 
                         beer? The amusing house wine...?

                                     CLARICE
                              (smiles)
                         Not lately. But maybe someday.

               He looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between 
               them, before Roden straightens, exultant.

                                     RODEN
                         Positive match!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're sure?

                                     RODEN
                              (points with his dental 
                              probe)
                         West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer 
                         Starling, meet Mister Acherontia 
                         Styx.

               He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's 
               specimen. She leans forward, intently.

               HER POV (MAGNIFICATION)

               the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right 
               between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is 
               nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         Better known to his friends as the 
                         Death's-head Moth...

                                     PILCHER (O.S.)
                         The Latin name comes from two rivers 
                         in Hell. Your man - he drops these 
                         girls into rivers, every time. Didn't 
                         I read that?

               FAVORING CLARICE

               as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         And there's no way - no natural way - 
                         these could've wound up in the bodies?

                                     PILCHER
                              (shakes his head)
                         They live in Malaysia. In this 
                         country, they'd have to be specially 
                         raised, from imported eggs.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause, then softly)
                         Dr. Lecter...

               As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - 
               the wail of police SIRENS - and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT)

               An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an 
               intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway 
               patrol cruisers.

               The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - 
               SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a 
               small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Maybe we can trace how he buys the 
                         bugs, starting with U.S. Customs...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING)

               The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech 
               equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking 
               quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a 
               computer.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's 
                         old lovers. Maybe, someday...

               CLARICE AND CRAWFORD

               sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice 
               can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, 
               awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         But for Catherine Martin, it all 
                         comes down to you and Lecter. You're 
                         the one he talks to.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's already offered to help... What 
                         would happen if we just showed our 
                         cards - asked him for Bill?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He offered to help, Starling, not to 
                         snitch. That wouldn't give him enough 
                         chance to show off. Remember, Lecter 
                         looks mainly for fun. Never forget 
                         fun.

                                     CLARICE
                         But if he knew we have so little 
                         time -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If we act too anxious, he'll make us 
                         wait. He'll let the Senator keep 
                         hoping, day after day, until Catherine 
                         finally washes up. That'd be the 
                         most fun of all.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think he means it, this time. I 
                         think he'll deal.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What would it take?

                                     CLARICE
                         Transfer to a new prison. With a 
                         view of trees, he said, or even 
                         water... Can we swing that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         State to federal jurisdiction... We 
                         can do it - eventually - but we'll 
                         never get all the clearances in time. 
                         Can you convince him a deal's already 
                         in place?

                                     CLARICE
                         You'll back me up with some paperwork?
                              (he nods)
                         Then I'll try. But wouldn't this 
                         have more weight coming from the 
                         Senator herself?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (hesitates)
                         She doesn't know what we're up to. 
                         And we can't afford to let her find 
                         out.

               Clarice looks at him, surprised.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She's the mother, Starling. She can't 
                         possibly comprehend what Lecter is. 
                         She'd make the mistake of pleading 
                         with him. Begging him... He'd feast 
                         on her pain till the last second of 
                         that girl's life...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BALTIMORE STATE HOSP. FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the 
               administration wing. He looks quite agitated.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         We can't trust Frederick Chilton, 
                         either. He's greedy and ambitious. 
                         If he knew about Lecter's link to 
                         Bill, he's go straight to the 
                         newspapers...

               Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase. 
               He points his gold pen at her accusingly.

                                     CHILTON
                         What you're doing, Miss Starling, is 
                         coming into my hospital to conduct 
                         an interview, and refusing to share 
                         information with me. For the third 
                         time!

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is 
                         just routine follow-up on the Raspail 
                         case.

                                     CHILTON
                         He's my patient! I have rights!
                              (grabs her arm, 
                              stopping her)
                         I'm not just some turnkey, Miss 
                         Starling. I shouldn't even be here 
                         this afternoon. I had a ticket to 
                         Holiday on Ice.

               She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm acting on instruction, Dr. 
                         Chilton.
                              (handing him a card)
                         This is the U.S. Attorney's number. 
                         Now please - either discuss this 
                         with him, or let me do my job.

               She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and 
               hostility. He clicks his pen, watching her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with 
               charcoal on butcher paper.

               He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other 
               drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for 
                         a United States Senator, you're an 
                         odd choice of messenger?

               Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers 
               from her briefcase.

                                     CLARICE
                         I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You 
                         chose to speak to me. Would you prefer 
                         someone else now? Or perhaps you 
                         don't think you can help us.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That is both impudent and untrue... 
                         Tell me, how did you feel when you 
                         viewed our Billy's latest effort?
                              (beat; he smiles)
                         Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

                                     CLARICE
                         By the book, he's a sadist.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Life's too slippery for books, 
                         Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from 
                         the same God.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was 
                         she a large girl?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Big through the hips. Roomy.

                                     CLARICE
                         They all were.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmm. And what else...?

                                     CLARICE
                         She had an insect deliberately 
                         inserted in her throat. That hasn't 
                         been made public yet. We don't know 
                         what is means.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Was it a butterfly?

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; staring at 
                              him)
                         A moth... How did you predict that?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. 
                         Enchant me.

               Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect 
               her thoughts. She looks up at him again, evenly.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you help us find Buffalo Bill in 
                         time to save Catherine Martin, the 
                         Senator promises you a transfer to 
                         the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, 
                         New York, with a view of the woods 
                         nearby. Maximum security still 
                         applies, but you'd have reasonable 
                         access to books.

               He is silent. She rises, moves closer, carrying papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Best of all, though - one week a 
                         year you'd get to leave the hospital 
                         and go here.
                              (points to a map)
                         Plum Island. Every afternoon of that 
                         week you can walk on the beach or 
                         swim in the ocean for up to one hour. 
                         Under SWAT team surveillance, of 
                         course...

               His face remains neutral. She puts the papers in his food 
               tray.

                                     CLARICE
                         Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, 
                         copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her 
                         offer is final and non-negotiable. 
                         If Catherine dies -
                              (she slides his tray 
                              through)
                         You get nothing.

               A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks 
               down at the papers, without touching them.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "Plum Island Animal Disease Research 
                         Center." Sounds charming.

                                     CLARICE
                         That's just part of the island. It 
                         has a very nice beach. Terns nest 
                         there.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it 
                         will be "turns" with us, too. Quid 
                         pro quo. I tell you things, you tell 
                         me things. Not about this case, though - 
                         about yourself. Yes or no?
                              (she is silent)
                         Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is 
                         waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

               She looks at him. A beat. They are standing uncomfortably 
               close.

                                     CLARICE
                         Go, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What's your worst memory of childhood?
                              (she hesitates)
                         Quicker than that. I'm not interested 
                         in your worst invention.

                                     CLARICE
                         The death of my father.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

               Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She 
               looks past him, hesitating again.

                                     CLARICE
                         He was a town marshal... one night 
                         he surprised two burglars, coming 
                         out the back of a drugstore... They 
                         shot him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Killed outright?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He was strong, he lasted almost 
                         a month. My mother - died when I was
                         very young, so my father had become - 
                         the whole world to me... After he 
                         left me, I had nobody. I was ten 
                         years old.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're very frank, Clarice. I think - 
                         it would be quite something to know 
                         you in private life.

                                     CLARICE
                         Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The significance of the moth is 
                         change. Caterpillar into cocoon into 
                         beauty... Billy wants to change, 
                         too, Clarice. But there's the problem 
                         of his size, you see. Even if he 
                         were a woman, he'd have to be a big 
                         one...

                                     CLARICE
                              (puzzled)
                         Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation 
                         in the literature between 
                         transsexualism and violence. 
                         Transsexuals are very passive.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clever girl. You're so close to the 
                         way you're going to catch him - do 
                         you realize that?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. Tell me why.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         After your father's death, you were 
                         orphaned. What happened next?
                              (Clarice drops her 
                              gaze)
                         I don't imagine the answer's on those 
                         second-rate shoes, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                         I went to live with my mother's cousin 
                         and her husband in Montana. They had 
                         a ranch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A cattle ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Horses - and sheep...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How long did you live there?

                                     CLARICE
                         Two months.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why so briefly?

                                     CLARICE
                         I - ran away...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (angrily)
                         No.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did he try to?

                                     CLARICE
                         No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Billy's not a real transsexual, but 
                         he thinks he is. He tries to be. 
                         He's tried to be a lot of things, I 
                         expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         You said - I was very close to the 
                         way we'd catch him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         There are three major centers for 
                         transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, 
                         the University of Minnesota, and 
                         Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't 
                         be surprised if Billy has applied 
                         for sex reassignment at one or all 
                         of them, and been rejected.

                                     CLARICE
                         On what basis would they reject him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The personality inventories would 
                         trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, 
                         House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't 
                         test like a real transsexual.

                                     CLARICE
                         How would he test?

               Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take 
               a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement 
               into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. 
                         Oh, and Clarice - next time you will 
                         tell me why you ran away. Shall I 
                         summarize?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaken)
                         Yes, Doctor. Please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               VERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living 
               Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free. Trembling and 
               damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         You should try to obtain a list of 
                         males rejected from all three gender 
                         reassignment centers...

               PULLING BACK

               we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They 
               crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings 
               pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous 
               SOUND of show music.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Check first the ones rejected for 
                         lying about criminal records...

               CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE

               at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL 
               through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.

               As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the 
               dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom 
               briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... 
               a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming 
               knives...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Among those who tried to conceal 
                         their past, look for severe childhood 
                         disturbances, associated with 
                         violence... Possibly you'll find a 
                         childhood incarceration... Then go 
                         to their personality tests...

               We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing 
               colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various 
               stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese 
               lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty 
               background.

               MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye 
               Baby." And now we hear something else, too - the rapid 
               CLICKING of a sewing machine...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Study their drawings, especially. 
                         Billy's house drawings will show no 
                         happy future... No baby carriage, 
                         out in the yard. No pets, no toys, 
                         no flowers, no sun...

               We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we 
               APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old-
               fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a 
               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female 
               wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a 
               beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         His females will be more crudely 
                         sketched than him males - but he'll 
                         compensate by adding exaggerated 
                         adornments... jewelry, big breasts... 
                         And his tree drawings - oh, his trees 
                         will be frightful...

               Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the 
               MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. 
               As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting 
               happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, 
               the music starting to fade behind us...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy hates his own identity, he 
                         always has - and he thinks that makes 
                         him a transsexual. But his pathology 
                         is a thousand times more savage... 
                         He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He 
                         will be reborn...

               At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a 
               low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in 
               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. 
               Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail 
               wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly 
               moan from below.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         Pleeeeeeeease.....!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, which 
               rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. RISING along his 
               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel 
               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are 
               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a 
               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Bad news, Hannibal...

               WIDER ANGLE

               shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed 
               down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Gourmet magazine has rejected your 
                         recipe for braised kidneys...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL - DAY

               Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his 
               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations 
               with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the 
               floor.

                                     CHILTON
                         Perhaps you should have been less 
                         specific about what kind.
                              (to Barney)
                         Stand him by the toilet. Then leave 
                         us.

               Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies 
               go. Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.

                                     CHILTON
                         Such a lot of correspondence! I can 
                         hardly wait to analyze it in more 
                         detail... But first things first.

               Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the 
               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from 
               underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. 
               Lecter.

                                     CHILTON
                         I thought she might be looking for a 
                         civil rights violation in Migg's 
                         death, so I bugged you... Not a word 
                         to me in all these years, Hannibal. 
                         Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff 
                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. 
                         It's too pathetic.

               SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the 
               front of Dr. Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         You still think you're going to walk 
                         on some beach, and see the birdies? 
                         I don't think so, Hannibal... I called 
                         Senator Ruth Martin, and she never 
                         heard of any deal with you. She never 
                         heard of Clarice Starling, either. 
                         They scammed you, Hannibal...

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.

                                     CHILTON
                         When Crawford gets through milking 
                         you, he's giving you to Baltimore 
                         Homicide for the Raspail murder. And 
                         they're preparing some special 
                         surprises for you right now, in my 
                         electroshock room.

               DR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS)

               first looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to 
               his soft, white, inviting throat...

                                     CHILTON
                         The Starling bitch wants you to rot 
                         here, in this little box, till your 
                         teeth fall out and you're soiling 
                         diapers. You've seen the old ones, 
                         Hannibal. They weep when their stewed 
                         peaches get cold. That'll be you, 
                         too. Unless - you trade with me.

               FAVORING CHILTON

               as he sits chummily on the table.

                                     CHILTON
                         There never was a deal with Senator 
                         Martin - but there is now. I've been 
                         on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on 
                         your behalf. Here's what you get: if 
                         you identify Buffalo Bill, and the 
                         girl is found in time, Senator Martin 
                         will have you transferred to Brushy 
                         Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...

               CLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES

               as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly 
               lock onto something. They widen with interest.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         The Governor has already agreed. You 
                         get books, a view of the woods, and 
                         plenty of exercise time...

               DR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under 
               the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         And best of all, you'd be out of 
                         Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The 
                         Senator will verify these terms on 
                         the phone, and guarantee them in 
                         writing...

               BACK ON DR. LECTER

               as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his 
               eyes towards Chilton. We can almost hear his brain clicking.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         In exchange, I get your full 
                         cooperation in publishing a 
                         professional account of this - my 
                         successful interviews with you. You 
                         publish nothing. And I get exclusive 
                         access to any material from Catherine 
                         Martin... So. Do you accept my 
                         demands?
                              (pause)
                         Answer me, Hannibal.

               A beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INTO 
               SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated.

                                     CHILTON
                         You'll answer me now, or by God, 
                         you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. 
                         Who is Buffalo Bill?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (pause; then softly)
                         I'll tell the Senator herself. But 
                         only in Tennessee...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNS HOPKINS - GENDER IDENTITY CLINIC - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a 
               folder, strides down a hall beside DR. DANIELSON - early 
               50's, severe, in a lab coat. Nurses, doctors, glance as they 
               pass.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I'm not having a witch hunt here, 
                         Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, 
                         non-violent people with a real 
                         problem.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Dr. Danielson, the man we want was 
                         never your patient. It would be 
                         someone you refused because he tries 
                         to conceal a record of criminal 
                         violence. Please, Doctor - time is 
                         eating us up. Just show me the ones 
                         you've turned away.

               Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, 
               with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (adamantly)
                         Examination and interview materials 
                         are confidential. We've never violated 
                         an applicant's trust, and we never 
                         will.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You want to see a violation? This is 
                         a violation...

               He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it 
               down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it 
               clearly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, 
                         she was just ID'd. I met her on a 
                         slab in West Virginia. And sometime 
                         tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's 
                         going to do the same thing to 
                         Catherine Martin.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         That's a childish, bullying stunt, 
                         Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield 
                         surgeon, so you can put away your 
                         picture.

               Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford.

                                     BURROUGHS
                         Phone, Jack. Director Burke.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (snaps)
                         In a minute!

               Burroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Look... search your own records, if 
                         you prefer. You can do it a lot faster 
                         than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo 
                         Bill through your information, I'll 
                         suppress it. Nobody has to know this 
                         hospital cooperated.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I doubt very much that the FBI or 
                         any other government agency can keep 
                         a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will 
                         out... And then what? Will you give 
                         Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a 
                         big pair of sunglasses on this 
                         building, and a funny nose?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. 
                         Very humorous. You like the truth? 
                         Try this.
                              (right in his face, 
                              enraged)
                         He kidnaps young women and kills 
                         them and rips their skin off. We 
                         don't want him to do that anymore. 
                         If you don't help me, just as fast 
                         as you can, then the Justice 
                         Department is going to ask publicly 
                         for a court order, We'll ask twice a 
                         day, just in time for the morning 
                         and evening news. And each one of 
                         our press conferences will focus on 
                         Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, 
                         and how we're still hoping for his 
                         cooperation. And every time there's 
                         any news on the case - when Catherine 
                         Martin floats, when the next one 
                         floats, and the next one - why, we'll 
                         just issue another press release 
                         about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over 
                         at Johns Hopkins - complete with all 
                         his humorous fucking remarks.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (pause; stiffly)
                         It may be that - I could confer with 
                         my colleagues on this. And get back 
                         to you.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Would you, Doctor? That would be so 
                         kind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Crawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches 
               silently.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone; stunned)
                         Transferred...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               HAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. 
               Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by 
               flags.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         Already airborne for Memphis. Senator 
                         Martin's meeting him at the airport.
                              (uneasily)
                         Jack - did you make some sort of 
                         promise to Lecter, in the Senator's 
                         name?

               Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his 
               desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, 
               very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         We're going to have to talk about 
                         this, Jack. The Senator's mad as 
                         hell. Paul Krendler's over here from 
                         Justice, she's asking him to take 
                         charge in Memphis... I know that... 
                         But you're still in command of the 
                         task force, and Lecter's plane can 
                         still be ordered back. It's your 
                         call, Jack - but I want it now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills 
               him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (into phone)
                         Let him land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY

               Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just 
               slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's 
               furious.

                                     CLARICE
                         Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? 
                         That slimy little bastard! We were 
                         so close with Lecter - and now her 
                         last chance is gone.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Let's get some coffee and talk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a 
               sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails 
               them slowly, radios CRACKLING.

                                     CLARICE
                         Are you in trouble over this, Mr. 
                         Crawford? Can Senator Martin do 
                         something to you?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy 
                         Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have 
                         to retire in two years. It's not a 
                         consideration. But you are...
                              (beat)
                         You've done enough. If I keep you 
                         out of school any longer, you'll be 
                         recycled. Cost you six months, at 
                         least. I can guarantee you readmission 
                         here, but that's about it.
                              (he stops, looks at 
                              her)
                         Now's your chance, Starling. Go back 
                         to class. Leave Bill to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't want me chasing him, 
                         you shouldn't have taken me to that 
                         funeral home.

               He looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on.

                                     CLARICE
                         Lecter is still the key, I know he 
                         is. Whatever he told me about Bill 
                         is just as good now as it was before.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Or just as worthless. But I want you 
                         in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when 
                         he gets tired of toying with Senator 
                         Martin, he'll talk to you again. 
                         There's a plane waiting for you now 
                         at the airstrip.

               She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's 
               quit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I lied to Lecter. I'll need some 
                         kind of peace offering... Can I get 
                         the drawings from his cell?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea. Meantime, try to get a 
                         feel for Catherine Martin. Her 
                         apartment, her friends... how he 
                         might've stalked her. I'm going to 
                         the other two clinics, Minnesota and 
                         Ohio.
                              (he crumples his cup, 
                              tosses it)
                         Now's the hardest part, Starling. 
                         Use your anger, don't let it keep 
                         you from thinking. Just keep your 
                         eyes on Catherine. We've got less 
                         than 30 hours.

                                     CLARICE
                              (hesitates)
                         Mr. Crawford... can those cops down 
                         there handle Dr. Lecter?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (grimly)
                         They'll use their best men. But they 
                         better be paying attention...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OFFICERS PEMBRY AND BOYLE

               two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking 
               Dr. Lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.

                                     BOYLE
                         Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm 
                         Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry. 
                         We aim to treat you just as nice as 
                         you treat us. Act like a gentlemen, 
                         you'll get three hots and a cot.

                                     PEMBRY
                         But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, 
                         buddy ruff. You get cute, try to 
                         bite somebody? - we'll tie your 
                         asshole in a knot. You savvy?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly 
                         do.

               The officers turn away, Boyle signing a clipboarded form.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. 
                         Won't be no trouble as all if he 
                         don't flip out.

                                     BOYLE
                         Dr. Chilton...?

               NEW ANGLE - WIDER

               as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. Parked to one 
               side: an EMS ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a 
               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. 
               Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances 
               towards the open hanger doorway.

                                     BOYLE
                         If you'll please sign right here, 
                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

               Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold 
               pen; it's gone. He searches other pockets, with growing 
               unhappiness.

                                     BOYLE
                         Use mine.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Here they come.

               TWO BLACK STRETCH LIMOUSINES

               glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. Secret Service agents 
               pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. A driver opens the 
               rear door of the second car, and Krendler steps out, followed 
               by the Senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as 
               last, by the Senator herself. Barely glancing around, she 
               strides towards Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - DR. LECTER AND SEN. MARTIN

               as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his 
               restraints. The others instinctively keep a distance, but 
               Chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes Dr. 
               Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               They stare at one another for a long moment: the Senator 
               tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit 
                         guaranteeing your new rights... You'll 
                         want to read it before I sign.

               He assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I won't waste your time and 
                         Catherine's time bargaining for petty 
                         privileges. Clarice Starling and 
                         that awful Jack Crawford have wasted 
                         far too much already. I only pray 
                         they haven't doomed the poor girl... 
                         Let me help you now, and I'll trust 
                         you when it's all over.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have my word. Paul?

               Krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Buffalo Bill's real name is William 
                         Rubin. I met him just once. He was 
                         referred to me in April or May, 1980, 
                         by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They 
                         were lovers, but Raspail had become 
                         very frightened. Apparently Rubin 
                         had murdered a transient, and - done 
                         things with the skin. He thought if 
                         I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be 
                         safe from the police, and he's be 
                         safe from Billy... Obviously, he was 
                         wrong.

                                     KRENDLER
                         We need his address, a physical descr-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you nurse Catherine?

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (pause; startled)
                         What...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you breast-feed her?

               He flicks his tongue obscenely.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You son-of-a -

               The Senator stills him with a hand. She is trembling.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Yes... I did.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?
                              (a beat; then rapidly, 
                              bored)
                         Six foot one, strongly built, about 
                         190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale 
                         blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said 
                         he lived in Philadelphia, but may 
                         have lied. That's really all I can 
                         remember, Senator - but if I think 
                         of any more, I'll let you know.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (to the others)
                         Let's go with it.

               They start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Senator Martin...! You can't trust 
                         Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. 
                         It's such a game with these people. 
                         They're determined to get the arrest 
                         for themselves. The "collar," I think 
                         they say.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in 
                         mind.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S BASEMENT - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLOSE ON scraps of food - peas, chicken bones - lying on the 
               cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a TV dinner.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                              (muttering, feisty)
                         Close enough to fuck is close enough 
                         to fight...

               CATHERINE

               is hunched over in concentration. The plastic toilet bucket 
               is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get my legs round your neck, you 
                         goddamn creep, I'll send you home to 
                         Jesus...

               HER FINGERS

               are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it 
               meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her 
               wrist.

               SHE STANDS

               gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket 
               by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement 
               floor.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Okay, Precious. Time for a treat...

               She hurls the bucket upwards.

               AT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE

               the bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside.

               ANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS

               who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks 
               an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate.

               DOWN IN THE PIT

               Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast.

               THE BUCKET LANDS

               two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops.

               PRECIOUS TROTS UP

               then pauses, staring curiously towards...

               VERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV)

               the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as 
               Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards 
               the pit.

               Precious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious.

               CATHERINE

               staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (softly)
                         Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice 
                         yummy bone... c'mon, you little 
                         shit...

               PRECIOUS

               edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing 
               the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but 
               Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like 
               a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop.

               CATHERINE

               stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hang on, boy... hang on...

               PRECIOUS

               still fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks 
               precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... 
               until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily 
               into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over 
               the edge.

               CATHERINE

               crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Nooooo...!

               THE LITTLE DOG

               furious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust.

               CLOSE ON CATHERINE

               as she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil 
               tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held 
               in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on 
               the glass.

               Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at -

               A young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He 
               smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. 
               He also wears gloves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around.

               A big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the 
               breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new 
               red phones are hooked up as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM

               Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks 
               inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ATTIC CRAWL-SPACE

               A ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds. Clarice, 
               lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               Flat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's 
               bed. She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               CLOSE ON an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a 
               bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry.

               Clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure 
               suddenly looms INTO SHOT, giving her a bad start; she cries 
               out softly.

               Senator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Who are you, please? I thought the 
                         police were through in here.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (softly, very angry)
                         Clarice Starling...
                              (calls out)
                         Paul? Would you come in here, 
                         please...?

               Krendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy 
                         Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul, 
                         this is the trainee that Jack Crawford 
                         sent to Lecter... She lied to him, 
                         pretending to have my authority, and 
                         thus jeopardized this entire 
                         investigation. Now she has the further 
                         gall to invade my daughter's privacy, 
                         again without permission. If her 
                         little games have killed my baby...

               Overcome, she hurries from the room. Krendler shuts the door 
               behind her, points sternly at Clarice.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You're out of line, Starling, and 
                         you're off this case. Back to 
                         Quantico.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Your instructions are what I'm giving 
                         you now. Jack Crawford answers to 
                         the Director, and the Director answers 
                         to me. My God, Crawford's losing 
                         it...! He shouldn't even be on this, 
                         with his wife sick as she is... How 
                         the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
                         He gave you - what? Some kind of 
                         special ID? Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (stubbornly)
                         I need the ID to fly with my gun. 
                         The gun belongs in Quantico.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon 
                         as you get back. The gun, too. Be on 
                         the next plane, Starling, there's 
                         one in 90 minutes.

               Clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts 
                         me. Or at least, he used to. If I 
                         could just -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Lecter has already named Buffalo 
                         Bill.

               Clarice reacts, surprised. Krendler takes a folded computer 
               sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. She takes it, reads.

                         He gave us a perfectly good 
                         description, and we're on it now, so 
                         we won't be needing your little 
                         novelty act any longer - or his, 
                         either. He's under close guard at 
                         the courthouse, pending a prison 
                         transfer. The next plane, Officer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" 
                         strike you as - I don't know - kind 
                         of vague?

               Krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Do you need a police escort, Starling? 
                         Or do you think you can find the 
                         airport by yourself?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHELBY COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an 
               armada of police cruisers parked at the curb.

               Clarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door angrily. 
               Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawings - 
               she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion 
               makes her pause.

               Dr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, 
               is preening grandly. 

               Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and 
               inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

               SGT. TATE, a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's ID. He 
               looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?

                                     CLARICE
                         I just left him.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Access to Lecter is strictly limited. 
                         We've been getting death threats.
                              (hesitates again)
                         Log in, and check your weapon.

               He picks up a phone, murmurs into it. As he does so, Clarice 
               glances around this main ground floor lobby.

               HER POV

               The building looks like an armed fort. Cops with shotguns 
               guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the 
               stairs, the single elevator. More of them are coming and 
               going.

                                     MURRAY (V.O.)
                         Shoot, we haven't had this kinda 
                         security since the President came 
                         through town...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING

               Clarice and OFFICER MURRAY, a young patrolman, ride up in an 
               old-fashioned, CREAKING, metal-cage elevator. He is excited.

                                     MURRAY
                         Every cop in Tennessee wants a look 
                         at this guy. 'Sit true what they're 
                         sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         I don't have a name for what he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - 5TH FLOOR

               Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the 
               unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings.

                                     PEMBRY
                         You know the rules, ma'am?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned 
                         him before.

               He waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now.

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. A 
               massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer 
               Boyle sits facing its barred door. He rises, nods, moving 
               away to allow her privacy.

               INSIDE THE CAGE

               a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a 
               flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. Dr. Lecter sits at the 
               table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file. 
               He now wears a green prison jumpsuit. A small cassette player 
               is chained to the steel table.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (without turning)
                         Good afternoon, Clarice.

               She stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.

                                     CLARICE
                         I thought you might want your drawings 
                         back... Just until you get your view.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford
                         send you here for one last wheedle - 
                         before you're both booted off the 
                         case?

                                     CLARICE
                         Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

               He spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         People will say we're in love.
                              (beat)
                         Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? 
                         Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...

               He spins again in his chair, playfully.

               MOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE

               as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. 
                         You couldn't have talked with this 
                         "William Rubin", even once, and come 
                         out knowing so little about him... 
                         You made him up, didn't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clarice... you're hardly in a position 
                         to accuse me of lying.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think you were telling me the truth 
                         in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell 
                         me the rest now.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've studied the case file, have 
                         you...? Everything you need to find 
                         him is right in these pages. Whatever 
                         his name is.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then tell me how.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. 
                         Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each 
                         particular thing, ask: What is it, 
                         in itself, what is its nature...? 
                         What does he do, this man you seek?

                                     CLARICE
                         He kills w-

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sharply, as he stops)
                         No! That's incidental.

               CLOSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT as he rises, pained by her ignorance, 
               and crosses to the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What is the first and principal thing 
                         he does, what need does he serve by 
                         killing?

                                     CLARICE
                         Anger, social resentment, sexual 
                         frus-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, he covets. That's his nature. 
                         And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? 
                         Do we seek out things to covet? Make 
                         an effort to answer.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. We just -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. Precisely. We begin by coveting 
                         what we see every day. Don't you 
                         feel eyes moving over your body, 
                         Clarice? I hardly see how you 
                         couldn't. And don't your eyes move 
                         over the things you want?

                                     CLARICE
                         All right, then tell me how -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. It's your turn to tell me, 
                         Clarice. You don't have any more 
                         vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. 
                         Why did you run away from that ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         We don't reckon time the same way, 
                         Clarice. This is all the time you'll 
                         ever have.

                                     CLARICE
                         Later, listen, I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'll listen now. After your father's 
                         murder, you were orphaned. You were 
                         ten years old. You went to live with 
                         cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch 
                         in Montana. And - ?

                                     CLARICE
                         And - one morning I just - ran away...

               She turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not "just," Clarice. What set you 
                         off? You started what time?

                                     CLARICE
                         Early. Still dark.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Then something woke you. What? Did 
                         you dream...? What was it?

               IN FLASHBACK

               The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, 
               frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn. 
               Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, 
               partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I heard a strange sound...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What was it?

               THE CHILD RISES

               crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't know. I went to look...

               HIGH ANGLES (2ND STORY) - THE CHILD'S POV

               Shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby 
               barn, carrying mysterious bundles. The mens' breath is 
               steaming... A refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine 
               adding more steam. A strange, almost surrealistic scene...

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Screaming! Some kind of - screaming. 
                         Like a child's voice...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               is terrified; she covers her ears.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What did you do?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Got dressed without turning on the 
                         light. I went downstairs... outside...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn 
               door. She ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who 
               passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. He goes 
               into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I crept up to the barn... I was so 
                         scared to look inside - but I had 
                         to...

               THE LITTLE GIRL'S POV

               as the open doorway LOOMS CLOSER... Bright lights inside, 
               straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...

                         And what did you see, Clarice?

               A SQUIRMING LAMB

               is held down on a table by two ranch hands.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Lambs. The lambs were screaming...

               A third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody 
               knife. Just as he's about to slice its throat -

               BACK TO THE ADULT CLARICE

               staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the 
               child's shock. We see Dr. Lecter, over her shoulder, studying 
               her intently.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         They were slaughtering the spring 
                         lambs?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...! They were screaming.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         So you ran away...

                                     CLARICE
                         No. First I tried to free them... I 
                         opened the gate of their pen - but 
                         they wouldn't run. They just stood 
                         there, confused. They wouldn't run...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         But you could. You did.

                                     CLARICE
                         I took one lamb. And I ran away, as 
                         fast as I could...

               IN FLASHBACK

               a vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the 
               little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Where were you going?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I don't know. I had no food or water. 
                         It was very cold. I thought - if I 
                         can even save just one... but he got 
                         so heavy. So heavy...

               The tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the 
               ground, hunched over in dispair.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't get more than a few miles 
                         before the sheriff's car found me. 
                         The rancher was so angry he sent me 
                         to live at the Lutheran orphanage in 
                         Bozeman. I never saw the ranch 
                         again...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         But what became of your lamb?
                              (no response)
                         Clarice...?

               BACK TO SCENE

               as the adult Clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. 
               She shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You still wake up sometimes, don't 
                         you? Wake up in the dark, with the 
                         lambs screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you think if you saved Catherine, 
                         you could make them stop...? Do you 
                         think, if Catherine lives, you won't 
                         wake up in the dark, ever again, to 
                         the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (a pause; then, oddly 
                              at peace)
                         Thank you, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a whisper)
                         Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Dr. Chilton... I believe you know 
                         each other?

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice turns, startled, and the fuming Chilton seizes 
               her elbow. Pembry and Boyle are beside him, looking grim.

                                     CHILTON
                         Out. Let's go.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to 
                         have you put on a place.

               Clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Brave Clarice. Will you let me know 
                         if ever the lambs stop screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                              (moving closer to the 
                              bars)
                         Yes. I'll tell you.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Promise...?
                              (she nods. He smiles)
                         Then why not take your case file? I 
                         won't be needing it anymore.

               He holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. She 
               hesitates, then reaches to take it.

               VERY CLOSE ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

               as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, 
               and lingers there, just for a moment.

               DR. LECTER'S EYES

               widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good-bye, Clarice.

               CLARICE

               hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her, pushing her away.

               HER POV - MOVING

               as Dr. Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GARMENT SWEATSHOP - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - MR. GUMB'S POV as he pushes a rolling rack of 
               completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as 
               aisle. SOUND of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, 
               as he passes row on row of work tables. The seamstresses, 
               mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly 
               avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some 
               nameless way.

               A thin FOREMAN in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching. He 
               rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack 
               rolls to a stop.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And 
                         what have you brought us today?

               He seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic 
               wrapper. He examines it, stroking the sleeve.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Oh, marvelous... You know, I always 
                         say you're the Leonardo of leather.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (a harsh whisper)
                         Oil.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Pardon...?

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You're leaving oil on the skin.

               The foreman quickly releases the jacket.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Of course... You'll be wanting your -

               Mr. Gumb's hand reaches INTO SHOT, snatching an envelope 
               from him. The foreman is watching him walk away, as a 
               seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments. The 
               foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off. He strokes 
               the jacket again, admiringly.

                                     FOREMAN
                              (to seamstress)
                         I wish we had a dozen like him...

               SOUND UPCUT - Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg 
               Variations...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - LOUNGE AREA - DUSK

               Clarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly 
               towards a departure ramp. Through a huge plate glass window, 
               we can see her plane. She glances back over her shoulder at

               A pair of UNIFORMED COPS brawny and impassive, their arms 
               folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight.

               Clarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway. The 
               BACH CONTINUES, as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHELBY CO. COURTHOUSE - HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM -

               NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried 
               by Pembry, as he approaches Dr. Lecter's cell.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (shouts)
                         Ready when you are, Doc!

               IN THE CELL

               the BACH is issuing from the cassette player. Beside it, on 
               the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is 
               an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice. 
               Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind 
               the paper screen. He calls out from there.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Just another minute, please!

               Pembry grunts, sets the tray down. Boyle joins him, handing 
               him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens 
               to belt clips. Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring 
               of keys.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for 
                         dinner, extra rare.

                                     BOYLE
                              (laughs)
                         What you reckon he'll want for 
                         breakfast - some fuckin' thing from 
                         the zoo?

               INSIDE THE SCREEN

               Dr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying 
               slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in 
               his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of 
               metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled 
               pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar 
               at one end, a square edge at the other.

               DR. LECTER

               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then 
               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He pushes 
               down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment he 
               smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, 
               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL

               Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet FLUSHES, and Dr. Lecter 
               reappears, looking jaunty.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same 
                         drill as lunchtime.

               Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles 
               backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists 
               through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his 
               hands.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm ready when you are, Officer 
                         Pembry.

               Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. He 
               tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his 
               wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods 
               to Boyle.

               NEW ANGLE - AT CELL DOOR

               as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around. 
               Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and 
               pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray.

               DR. LECTER

               watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from 
               him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear 
               off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift 
               key, held between the tips of his right index and middle 
               fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds 
               it.

               NEW ANGLE - FAVORING BOYLE

               as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards 
               Dr. Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray.

               BOYLE'S RIGHT HAND

               is just inches from the tray when Dr. Lecter's hand darts 
               INTO SHOT, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.

               BOYLE

               looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning 
               face of Dr. Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and 
               snaps -

               THE OTHER CUFF

               around the bolted leg of the table. And suddenly all natural 
               SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much 
               louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and 
               we see...

               VARIOUS ANGLES - EACH BLURRING INTO STOP-ACTION

               Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... 

               Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into 
               Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door 
               frame...

               Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his 
               pants pocket for his handcuff key...

               Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he 
               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... 

               Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at...

               Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...

               Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it 
               like a dog shakes a rat...

               Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...

               Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed 
               Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing 
               him to his knees...

               Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, 
               unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, 
               seeing...

               Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised 
               high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and 
               again...

               Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -

               CLOSE ANGLE ON

               the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now 
               flecked with blood. In addition to the Bach, we now hear 
               soft PANTING, close by, and whimpering SOBS in the background.

               ANGLE ON DR. LECTER

               eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His 
               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing 
               slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks 
               down.

               HIS POV

               By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled 
               from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.

               DR. LECTER

               picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a four-
               inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off screen, 
               turns.

               LOW ANGLE ON PEMBRY

               as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command 
               desk, and the phone. He is crying, but frantically determined.

               PEMBRY'S POV - PARTIALLY BLURRED, THEN CLEARING

               Above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and Boyle's 
               holstered revolvers...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then 
               indicates a stop there, at the top floor.

               FAVORING SGT. TATE

               at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. Another 
               cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a 
               magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in 
               the lobby.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         What is this shit...? Did somebody 
                         go up to five?
                              (Jacobs shakes his 
                              head)
                         Call Pembry, ask him what -

               A GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, 
               echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt. Tate jumps to his feet, 
               grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and 
               noisy.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         CP, shots fired on five! Repeat, 
                         shots fires on five! Outside posts 
                         look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly 
                         shit.

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4...

               BACK ON SGT. TATE

               as he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full 
               uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (to the others)
                         SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up 
                         on your outside posts. Bobby, get 
                         the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover 
                         that fucking elevator if it comes 
                         all the way to -

                                     A COP (O.S.)
                         It stopped!

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone 
               again.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me 
                         the SWAT team and an ambulance, double 
                         quick. We're going up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in 
               bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but 
               carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with 
               drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a 
               ghostly echo in here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               A thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator 
               door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer.

               SGT. TATE

               approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind 
               him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the 
               various office doors - all locked - as they creep up.

               MOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER

               as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins 
               to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (shouts at ceiling)
                         Pembry? Boyle...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               ANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on 
               the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD.

               After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for 
               the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving 
               low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. 
               They all freeze, staring in utter horror.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Oh no... no...

               THEIR POV

               is a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one 
               sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the 
               cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. 
               The faces are unrecognizable.

               SGT. TATE

               struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around 
               him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Command post... Two offi-
                              (a beat; clears his 
                              throat)
                         Two officers down. Prisoner is 
                         missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... 
                         He's stripped the bed, might be making 
                         a rope, check all windows. Where the 
                         fuck is my ambulance?

               IN THE CELL

               a cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his 
               fingers on Boyle's neck.

                                     JACOBS
                         Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's 
                         gone...

               AT THE OTHER BODY

               a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, 
               the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the 
               gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, 
               very softly.

                                     MURRAY
                         This one's alive!

               Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Take ahold of him where he can feel 
                         your hands, son. Talk to him.

                                     MURRAY
                         What's his name, Sarge?

                                     SGT. TATE
                         It's Pembry, now talk to him, God 
                         dammit.
                              (into radio, looking 
                              around)
                         Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. 
                         Lecter is missing and armed - he 
                         took Boyle's gun...

               The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds 
               up one finger to Tate.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into radio)
                         Pembry got off one round - there's a 
                         chance Lecter was hit. We heard a 
                         total of three shots fired, so he's 
                         got four left... He's got a knife, 
                         too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

               VARIOUS ANGLES on a floodlit scene of barely controlled 
               pandemonium. Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, 
               SIRENS in the distance. SWAT members, in full gear, leap 
               from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... EMS 
               orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... Cops kneel 
               for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the 
               windows...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT

               A trio of EMS orderlies work fast over the body, already 
               strapped on its gurney. They bandage a big plastic airway 
               into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at 
               the neck. Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody 
               fist.

                                     MURRAY
                         You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' 
                         good, buddy, you're gonna make it...

               One orderly massages the heart. Another is popping a plasma 
               bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts 
               convulsing.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Downstairs - let's go!

               Quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, 
               with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, SWAT 
               men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the 
               ready...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE ELEVATOR - DESCENDING - NIGHT

               Sgt. Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the 
                         elevator, bringing it down. Pembry 
                         and Boyle are both cleared, top three 
                         floors secured, main stairwell 
                         secured. He's somewhere on -

               A spot of blood falls on his cheek. He and Jacobs stare at 
               each other. Another spot hits his shoulder. They look up.

               THEIR POV

               Blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch.

               Sgt. Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere 
                         on two, sir... That's all for now, 
                         over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, 
               stepping quickly to the side. Tate reaches back in and -

               CLOSE ANGLE

               Locks the elevator into position, with its doors open.

               OTHER COPS are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate 
               frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (whispers)
                         He's on the roof of the elevator!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Two SWAT officers, PETERSON and KUBELL, turn a key, unlocking 
               and opening this floor's elevator doorway. The shaft is dark. 
               Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a 
               mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft.

               IN THE MIRROR (DISTORTED BY THE ANGLE)

               Is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on 
               his stomach, atop the elevator. A shiny revolver is near one 
               hand.

               PETERSON

               whispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault 
               rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge.

                                     PETERSON
                         I see him... There's a weapon by his 
                         hand. He's not moving...

                         Can you get the drop?

                                     PETERSON
                         We got the drop.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         One warning. Then take him out.

               Peterson nods to Kubell, who switches ON the flashlight, as 
               Peterson shouts down the shaft.

                                     PETERSON
                         Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

               IN THE MIRROR

               the green figure shows no movement.

               ANGLE ON THE COPS AGAIN

               as Peterson mutters to Kubell.

                                     PETERSON
                         Put one in his leg.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               The figure below, as Kubell's gunshot ROARS, echoing hugely 
               in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. 
               The figure doesn't stir.

               PETERSON

               staring down the shaft, raises his mike again.

                                     PETERSON
                         No movement.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Okay, Johnny, hold your fire...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               A small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, 
               from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER.

                                     SWAT COMMANDER
                              (into radio mike)
                         We're coming into the car, we're 
                         opening the hatch. Watch his hands. 
                         Any fire will come from us. Affirm?

                                     PETERSON'S VOICE
                         Got it.

               The SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks 
               at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body 
               armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the 
               corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets 
               a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big 
               Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch.

               CLOSE ON

               ...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a 
               body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught 
               at the waist. We see the back of the head.

               SGT. TATE

               shoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns 
               towards the SWAT commander, astonished.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         That's Pembry!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMS AMBULANCE - MOVING

               In the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against 
               the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his 
               patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND 
               of the siren.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (into radio mike)
                         He's comatose, but his vital signs 
                         are good. Pressure's 130 over 90... 
                         Yeah, 90! Pulse 85...

               Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure 
               sits slowly upright...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         His convulsions have stopped, but 
                         he's got so much loose skin on his 
                         face, it's hard to tell if -

               Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He 
               turns, puzzled...

               THE POCKETKNIFE BLADE

               in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS)

               MOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, 
               its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make 
               way for it.

               Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, 
               before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. 
               Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the 
               wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then 
               the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts 
               rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing 
               speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - 
               and we LINGER on...

               BIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN

               ...that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles."

               CLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

               Dr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it 
               with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MONTANA PLAIN - DUSK - (IN FLASHBACK)

               MOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, 
               over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at 
               last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in 
               despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from 
               us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT - BRIGHT MOONLIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last 
               to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is 
               standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards 
               the sheriff...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN

               CRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards 
               the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to 
               the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb.

               The dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly 
               takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - 
               stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BARN - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open 
               barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, 
               a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His 
               knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, 
               his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. 
               Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI DORM - PAY PHONE IN HALLWAY - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's 
               face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the 
               dangling receiver...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHOWER STALL - FBI DORM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a shower head, as water suddenly blasts out. Clarice 
               moves INTO SHOT, as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively, 
               almost desperately, unable to get clean...

                                     ARDELIA (V.O.)
                         They found the ambulance...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

               Clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet. 
               The Buffalo Bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her 
               feet. Ardelia hovers anxiously nearby.

                                     ARDELIA
                         In the parking garage at Memphis 
                         airport. The crew was dead. He killed 
                         a tourist, too. Got his clothes, 
                         cash... By now he could be anywhere.

               Clarice looks up. Her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, 
               and something close to despair. She reads Ardelia's thought.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He won't come after me.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                              (bitterly)
                         It would be rude. And he wouldn't 
                         get to ask any more questions...

               Ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Clarice - you did the best anybody 
                         could have for Catherine Martin. You 
                         stuck your neck out for her and you 
                         got your butt kicked for her and you 
                         tried. It's not your fault it ended 
                         this way.

                                     CLARICE
                         The worst part - the thing that's 
                         making me crazy - is that Bill is 
                         right in front of me. Only I can't 
                         see him...
                              (touching the case 
                              file)
                         Lecter said, everything I need to 
                         catch him is right here, in these 
                         pages...

                                     ARDELIA
                         Lecter said a lot of things.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shakes her head)
                         He's here, Ardelia.

               Ardelia stares back at her.

               SOUND UPCUT - the low throb of a washing machine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - ACADEMY DORM - NIGHT (VERY LATE)

               Clarice has spread out the case file across two washing 
               machines. Ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another 
               pile of forms. Nearby is their laundry basket, detergent 
               box.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (surprised)
                         Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting? 
                         She holds up the map, with its 
                         location markings for the kidnapping 
                         and body dump sites. Clarice takes 
                         it, looks.

               INSERT - THE MAP

               with newly inked words in Dr. Lecter's precise, elegant hand.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Clarice, doesn't this random 
                         scattering of sites seem overdone to 
                         you? Doesn't it seem desperately 
                         random - like the elaborations of a 
                         bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks up at Ardelia, puzzled but excited.

                                     CLARICE
                         "Desperately random." What does he 
                         mean?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Not random at all, maybe. Like there's 
                         some pattern here...?

                                     CLARICE
                         But there is no pattern. There's no 
                         connection at all among these places, 
                         or the computers would've nailed it! 
                         They're even found in random order.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Well, except for the one girl.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         What girl?

                                     ARDELIA
                         The one that was weighted down. Where 
                         is she...? Fred something.

               They search among the inserts. Clarice finds the graduation 
               photo.

                                     CLARICE
                         Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, 
                         Ohio. The first girl taken, but the 
                         third body found... Why?

                                     ARDELIA
                         'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted 
                         her down.

                                     CLARICE
                         But why? He didn't weight the others.

               Clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.

                                     CLARICE
                         The first, what the hell did Lecter 
                         say about... "First principles," he 
                         said. Simplicity... What does this 
                         guy do, he "covets." How do we first 
                         start to covet? "We covet what we 
                         see -"

               She stops, turns. She grabs the photo of Fredrica from 
               Ardelia, stares at it. She looks up, trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         "- every day."

                                     ARDELIA
                              (softly)
                         Hot damn, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         He knew her...!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford are seated in front of Director Burke, 
               who's at his desk. Another chair is empty, because Krendler 
               is pacing. All four are nearing their boiling points.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe he lives in this, this 
                         Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw 
                         her every day, and killed her sort 
                         of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant 
                         to... give her a 7-Up and talk about 
                         the choir. But then -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Starling -

                                     CLARICE
                         But then he had to cover up, make 
                         her seem just like all the rest of 
                         them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

                                     KRENDLER
                         The market in Lecter hints is way 
                         down, today, okay? I've got two good 
                         men dead in Memphis, and three
                         civilians. I've got -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Who the hell's fault is -

                                     KRENDLER
                         - a U.S. Senator who's half out of 
                         her head because her daughter's going 
                         to be murdered today! And all because 
                         of your mind games with fucking 
                         Lecter!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If you hadn't interfered, he'd still 
                         be in custody in Baltimore!

                                     BURKE
                         Jack -

                                     KRENDLER
                         You sent in a green recruit, with a
                         phony goddamn offer -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're just trying to cover your ass 
                         for letting him escape!

                                     BURKE
                         THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...

               A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. 
               Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally 
               retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice.

                                     BURKE
                              (very reluctantly)
                         Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. 
                         You're suspended from the Academy.
                              (Crawford starts to 
                              interrupt)
                         Not another word!
                              (to Clarice)
                         This is pending a reevaluation of 
                         your fitness for the service. I 
                         promise you'll get a fair hearing.
                              (pause)
                         Jack... you're ordered to take 
                         compassionate leave. You'll spend 
                         the rest of the day briefing the 
                         AG's office, then transfer command 
                         of the task force, effective by 1800 
                         hours.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take 
                         care of Bella.

               Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and 
               very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, 
               not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other.

                                     CLARICE
                         All his victims are women... His 
                         obsession is women, he lives to hunt 
                         women. But not one women is hunting 
                         him - except me. I can walk in a 
                         woman's room and know three times as 
                         much about her as a man would.
                              (beat)
                         I have to go to Belvedere.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You heard them. I don't have that 
                         authority anymore.

                                     CLARICE
                         You do until six p.m.

               He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, 
               defeated, old beyond his years.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, 
                         ten months ago. Our people worked 
                         it, so did the locals.

                                     CLARICE
                         But not from this angle. Not thinking 
                         he knew her. You've got to send me!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I 
                         won't disobey orders, not even now.

                                     CLARICE
                         But I just became a private citizen. 
                         I can go anywhere I want to.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         With ID and a gun...? Impersonating 
                         a federal agent is a felony.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. 
                         This morning, or maybe at noon, but 
                         today, and Belvedere's our last 
                         chance. I'm flying there, right now, 
                         unless you stop me. You want my ID? 
                         Here - take it...

               He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's 
               passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pulls out his wallet)
                         There's about $300 here... And a 
                         hotline code number. They'll patch 
                         you through to me, wherever I am.

               She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or 
               his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, 
               smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.

               SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, 
               as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, 
               as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in 
               background.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (calling out)
                         Preeeeecious...!

               CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through 
               the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The 
               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult 
               moths flutter out.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Precious, come on Precious! Busy 
                         busy day today...

               CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently 
               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!

               CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch 
               barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a 
               practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note 
               of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You come here this minute, you little 
                         scamp!

               LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through 
               his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking 
               anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. 
               Genuinely scared.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious...?

               LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING

               Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the 
               oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Sweetheart...?

               From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         She'd down here you sack of shit.

               Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the 
               doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with 
               a series of YIPS.

               UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM

               as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious, are you all right?

               REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE

               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing 
               Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me a telephone. Lower it down to 
                         me. Do it now, mister! I don't want 
                         to have to hurt this little dog.

               UPWARD ANGLE

               on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from 
               inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim.

               Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming 
               at him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You shoot motherfucker you better 
                         kill me quick or I'll break her 
                         fucking neck, I swear to God!

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (wails)
                         Nooooooo!

               Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting 
               the head. The dog WHINES piteously.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Back off, you son of a bitch! Back 
                         off!

               UPWARD ANGLE

               as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream 
               of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               On Catherine, as she maintains her grip.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's better... Now get me a live 
                         telephone. Get a long extension and 
                         lower is down here... And you better 
                         do it fast, too, 'cause I think her 
                         leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, 
                         she needs a vet.

               MR. GUMB

               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         You think she's in pain? You don't 
                         know what pain is. But you're going 
                         to find out...

               And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing 
               off.

               CATHERINE

               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She 
               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in 
               its fur, sobbing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BELVEDERE, OHIO - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops. 
               After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly. Double-
               checking this address, she glances up from a folded street

               AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE

               in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow 
               river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along 
               this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from 
               there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

               An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish 
               water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, 
               gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a 
               new coop.

               CLARICE

               approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red-
               rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Bimmel...? 

               He stares back at her, warily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIMMEL HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN as Mr. Bimmel leads Clarice up a 
               steep flight of steps. The bannister is worn, sags a bit.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         I don't know nothin' new to tell ya. 
                         The police been back here so many 
                         times already... Fredrica went into 
                         Columbus on the bus to see about a 
                         job. She left the interview OK. She 
                         never come home.

               Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: 
               the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show 
               Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful 
               at each age.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         Her room's how she left it. Just 
                         shut the door when you're done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FREDRICA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING SLOWLY as she takes in flowery chintz 
               curtains... posters of Madonna and Blondie... a twin bed, 
               with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow... a big sewing 
               machine in the corner.

               CLARICE

               turns, absorbing nuances. There is loneliness here, an echo 
               of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling. A shrill 
               MEOW, and she looks down...

               BIG TORTOISESHELL CAT

               is rubbing against her ankles.

               CLARICE

               picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears. She glances up.

               IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR

               she and the cat stares back at their own reflection...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school 
               yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs 
               and singles. The cat has wandered off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               pulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised 
               and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from 
               the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing 
               supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging 
               clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer 
               look.

               THE DRESS

               is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of 
               the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a 
               blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back.

               FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE

               as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on 
               the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She 
               takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool 
               metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. 
                         But there's the problem of his size, 
                         you see...

               She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she 
               straightens, her attention riveted by something...

               CLARICE'S POV

               On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined 
               dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there 
               shapes, before jumping back to -

               CLARICE

               who stares at them, starting to tremble.

                         Even if he were a woman, he'd have 
                         to be a big one...

               IN FLASHBACK

               those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in 
               the funeral home in West Virginia...

               CLOSE ON CLARICE

               as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy.

                         keeps them alive to starve them awhile -

               Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, 
               in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin 
               is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. 
               Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing.

               INTERCUTTING

               as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with 
               disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Sir, that's great news. But how -

                         Johns Hopkins finally came up with a

                         Offenders, and he came up cherries.

                              Burroughs)
                         Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA 
                         "John Grant." Lecter's description 
                         was accurate, he just lied about the 
                         name.

               from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the 
               twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, 
               quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - 
               silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades...

                         psychiatric. Where, Starling, he

                         Take a bow. Customs had some paper 
                         on his alias. They stopped a carton 
                         two years ago at LAX - live 
                         caterpillars from Surinam. The 
                         addressee was "John Grant." Calumet 
                         Power & Light's given us two possible 
                         residences under that alias. We're

                         Chicago's only about 400 miles from
                         here. I could be there in -

                         No, Starling, there isn't time. And 
                         you've still got crucial work to do 
                         in Ohio. We want him for murder, not 
                         kidnapping. I'm counting on you to 
                         link him to the Bimmel girl, before 
                         he's indicted.

               Clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment.

                              (pause; gently)
                         Starling - you've earned back your 
                         place in the Academy. We never 
                         would've found him without you, and 
                         nobody's ever going to forget that. 
                         Least of all me.

               switches off, feeling bad for her. On the console near him, 
               the fax machine starts to CHATTER. He turns, looks.

                         Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a 
                         man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?
                              (Stacy shakes her 
                              head)
                         Do you think she could've had a friend 
                         you didn't know about?

                                     STACY
                         No way. She had a guy, I'da known, 
                         believe me. Sewing was her life, she 
                         was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did you ever work with her?

                         Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to 
                         help her do alterations for old Mrs. 
                         Lippman. Lots of people worked for 
                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? But she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she 
                         could handle.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd 
                         like to talk to her.

                                     STACY
                         She died. She went to Florida to 
                         retire, like two years ago? She dies 
                         own there.

               Clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail.

                                     STACY
                              (beat; shyly)
                         Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think so.

                                     STACY
                         You get to travel around and stuff? 
                         I mean, better places then this?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes you do.

                         Freddie was so happy for me when I 
                         got this job. This - toaster 
                         giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the 
                         speakers all day - she thought this 
                         was really hot shit. What did she 
                         know, big dummy...

               Suddenly she's fighting tears. Clarice reaches to hug her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WIDE ANGLE on what appears to be, at first, a calm, ordinary 
               neighborhood of working class two- and three-story houses. 
               But the street is strangely quiet, deserted.

               After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, 
               dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs 
               to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing 
               and then disappearing...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red 
               night-vision goggles over his eyes. Moths flutter past his 
               face. His mouth is set in a grim line...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An HRT cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd HRT 
               Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him. They both 
               take aim with their scoped rifles at -

               TELEPHOTO ANGLE (WITH RIFLE CROSSHAIRS)

               The front door of a big, nearby, split-level house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON a fuse box, as Mr. Gumb reaches in, flips a switch. 
               The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar 
               is bathed in a green glow...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly 
               startled to find himself staring into the grim face of -

               A MEMBER OF THE HRT

               crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little 
               boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, 
               covering his mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Mr. Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through 
               his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so 
               delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past 
               him in the eerie light...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMENT CITY - DAY

               A florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street 
               and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, 
               in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the 
               cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of 
               the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a 
               long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards 
               the house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MR. GUMB'S POV - MOVING ANGLE on the top of the oubliette, a 
               glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and 
               closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom 
               of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up 
               at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. 
               Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up 
               to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head 
               and neck.

               MR. GUMB

               Looking down at her, smiles...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - SUSPECT'S HOUSE - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he 
               mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked 
               into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic.

               CRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS

               have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, 
               with drawn guns, watching tensely as -

               THE "DELIVERYMAN"

               settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches 
               out with his right hand towards the buzzer...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, 
               which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, 
               surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees -

               DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX

               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is 
               making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but 
               not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, 
               off screen, as -

               MR. GUMB

               raises his gun again, spinning back towards -

               HIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM

               where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly 
               yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the 
               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.

               MR. GUMB

               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to 
               safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, 
               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good afternoon... I wonder if you 
                         could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. 
                         Lippman's family?

               Mr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we 
               get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         They don't live here anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral 
               box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, 
               blowing it through as -

               Crawford and Burroughs race towards the door, guns up...

               Mr. Gumb starts to close the door, only to have Clarice push 
               back against it, politely but firmly. She holds up her ID.

                                     CLARICE
                         Excuse me, but I really do need to 
                         talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's 
                         house. Did you know her?

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (beat)
                         Just briefly. What's the problem, 
                         Officer?

               A bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot 
               through it, EXPLODING on the floor. An instant later, a black-
               clad HRT cop dives through the shattered glass, rolls across 
               the floor, comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed-off

                         I'm investigating the death of

                         Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica 
                         when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?

                         No. Wait... Was she a great, fat 
                         person? I may have seen her, I'm not 
                         sure...

               Burroughs shakes his head: Nothing here...

               Mr. Gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his 
               kitchen, then turns back to Clarice with a smile.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he 
                         could help you. I have his card 
                         somewhere. Do you mind stepping 
                         inside, while I looks for it?

               doorway. THROUGH this doorway, we watch as Mr. Gumb, at the 
               end of his front hall, slips the chain. Clarice enters, 
               closing the door behind her.

               walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once

               CAMERA RUSHES VERY CLOSE

                         every time I think about it...

               Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. One archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. His tone is casual, neutral.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Are they close to catching somebody, 
                         do you think?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think we may be, yes.

               Mr. Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. His back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after Mrs. Lippman died?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes. I bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did she leave any records here? Tax 
                         or business records? Maybe a list of 
                         employees?

               CLOSE ON MR. GUMB'S BACK

               as he continues his rummaging.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No, nothing at all. Has the FBI 
                         learned something? Because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth. 
               It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               CLARICE

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of 
               pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

                                     CLARICE
                         No... no, we don't.

               Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, 
               lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes 
               back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.

               MR. GUMB

               turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business 
               card.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Ahhh. Here's that number.

               CLARICE

               keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you 
                         have a phone I can use?

               MR. GUMB

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He 
               looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open.

               HER EYES

               are unmoving, locked on his.

               HIS EYES

               stare back at her, widen. And they know each other.

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         In the kitchen. I'll show you.

               CLARICE

               whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze!

               MR. GUMB

               slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.

               CLARICE

               tries to force more authority into her voice.

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under 
                         arrest. Down on the floor, hands and 
                         legs spread, move it.

               MR. GUMB

               turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, 
               disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.

               CLARICE

               hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - 
               and then it's too late.

                                     CLARICE
                         Shit!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun.

               HER POV - MOVING

               The kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering 
               on its hinges...

               CLARICE

               rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming 
               her gun down -

               AN EMPTY STAIRWELL

               brightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the 
               bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb.

               CLARICE

               hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: 
               she is very scared, but suddenly hears -

               The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there 
               in that killing maze.

               CLARICE

               rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs.

               BEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; 
               the Colt Python is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More 
               SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice 
               goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over-
               head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; 
               Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes 
               to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to 
               her left, and the BARKING of a dog...

               CLARICE

               follows her gun around the corner, looking right.

               EMPTY PASSAGEWAY

               but doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of 
               them. She looks left... sees an opening onto some kind of 
               chamber. The noises are LOUDER, coming from there.

               CLARICE

               moves cautiously towards this chamber...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUBLIETTE CHAMBER - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling...

               HER POV - MOVING

               the open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, 
               opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either 
               one of them, or come up behind her... She moves to the pit, 
               looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine SCREAMING, 
               hysterical, and a little white dog BARKING...

               CLARICE

               kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover 
               them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing 
               there?

                                     CLARICE
                         FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.
                         GET ME OUT!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're all right! Where is he?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me out!

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I 
                         can hear. Shut that dog up.
                              (still swivelling)
                         Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I don't know! Get me out!!

                                     CLARICE
                         Catherine. Listen to me. I have to 
                         find a rope. I have to leave this
                         room, just for a minute, but -

                                     CATHERINE
                         NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you 
                         LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU 

                                     CLARICE
                         Shut UP!
                              (then, louder)
                         The other officers will be here any 
                         minute! you're perfectly safe now!

               Ignoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs 
               away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it 
               quickly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW PASSAGEWAY - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING down this passageway, towards a new 
               room... pausing at the doorway, straining to hear... no sound 
               except Catherine's CRYING, not in the background, and 
               Clarice's own RAPID BREATHING. Then she crouches -

               LOWER ANGLE - bursts forward, through the doorframe, 
               sidestepping...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back 
               to the wall. Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in...

               HER POV - MOVING NERVOUSLY

               Mr. Gumb's sewing machine... his swivel chair... the old 
               Victrola... Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, 
               overhead; they're everywhere. Suddenly, from just behind 
               her, a CLICK and a HUM, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, almost shoots, before seeing -

               A SMALL REFRIGERATOR

               with its thermostat just switching ON.

               CLARICE

               gasps for breath, fighting for calm. She turns again, slashing 
               her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKINNING ROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... 
               then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot 
               into it. Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its 
               DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... 
               the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is

               A CLOSED DOOR

               Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, 
               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, 
               sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus 
               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Passing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a 
               half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously 
               skirted. She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound 
               inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She 
               twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun 
               inside, all in one quick move...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a 
               big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended 
               from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside.

               CLARICE

               centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks 
               it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something 
               lower down catches her eye.

               She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at 
               first, that she's seeing -

               FEMALE HAND AND WRIST

               sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple 
               plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish 
               and a dainty wristwatch. As -

               CLARICE

               is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to 
               be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow 
               of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns 
               blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand 
               clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. 
               SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice 
               stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches 
               the door frame...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms 
               out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of 
               her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved 
               darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of 
               the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified 
               BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths 
               smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then 
               stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following 
               her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -

               MR. GUMB

               who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a 
               high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and 
               kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, 
               like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed 
               suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a 
               ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, 
               completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. 
               Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his 
               gun in both hands, aiming...

               CLOSE ON

               the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the 
               hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her 
               gun muzzle, as we see -

               THE TWO FIGURES

               almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH 
               from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, 
               overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -

               CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -

               with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the 
               floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; 
               there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but 
               she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her 
               jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, 
               reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her 
               stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled 
               eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is 
               he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears 
               something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps 
               eight feet away...

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, 
               until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on 
               his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against 
               his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't 
               needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips 
               working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches 
               slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize 
               something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand 
               drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, 
               making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to 
               roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.

               OVERHEAD ANGLE

               down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers 
               on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that 
               her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto -

               A DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH -

               perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping 
               slowly.

               SOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK

               The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a 
               glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and 
               vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, 
               EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective 
               barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as

               CLARICE

               dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking 
               protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney.

               They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen 
               with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, 
               is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her 
               up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways 
               with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at 
               once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, 
               desperate for a familiar face.

               AN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. 
               He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, 
               stopping when he sees Clarice.

               THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

               for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with 
               sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any 
               words. And then he does.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling... your father sees you.

               And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, 
               but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. 
               HOLD ON them for a long beat.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Congratulations! You are now officers 
                         of the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY

               The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their 
               best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then 
               turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. 
               Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands 
               behind his podium.

               CLARICE AND ARDELIA

               look at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, 
               in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is 
               radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin 
               scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards 
               the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, 
               searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she 
               locates

               CRAWFORD

               who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little 
               salute.

               CLARICE

               grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to 
               wave towards the crowd with the others.

               MOVING ANGLE

               over the admiring sea of spectators, several hundred of them, 
               still rising from their folding chairs, APPLAUDING in 
               celebration of these special young people, this perfect, 
               sunlit day.

               SOUND UPCUT - rock music, laughter - as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ACADEMY DORM - REC ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               A LOUD party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new 
               grads celebrate ferociously. Ardelia weaves her way through 
               the crowded room, reaches Clarice, who is flanked by her 
               special guests - Pilcher and Roden, the two ardent scientists. 
               Ardelia has to shout at Clarice over the din.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Agent Starling! Telephone!

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised)
                         Agent Mapp! Thank you!

               She nods to Pilcher, leaves them. Roden, who is quite happily 
               drunk, grabs the startled Ardelia around the waist.

                                     RODEN
                         Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down.

               Ardelia looks at Pilcher, confused.

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily.

                                     CLARICE
                         Starling.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped 
                         screaming...?

               She freezes, stunned by the familiar voice. Then she turns, 
               waving frantically towards

               ARDELIA

               who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, 
               lost in conversation with Pilcher and Roden. Ardelia glances 
               at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Don't bother with a trace, I won't 
                         be on long enough.

               CLARICE

               turns back, gripping the phone more tightly.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A CLEAR NIGHT SKY

               Very beautiful, glittering with countless stars.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Where I have a view, Clarice...

               MOVING DOWN

               we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay. Boats ride at anchor, 
               lights shimmering...

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Orion is looking splendid tonight, 
                         and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his 
                         flock...

               DR. LECTER

               smiles into his mobile phone. He is stretched out on a 
               lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a 
               penknife. His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, 
               lighter hair. He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (into phone)
                         Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, 
                         but not forever... You'll have to 
                         earn it again and again, this blessed 
                         silence. Because it's the plight 
                         that drives you, and the plight will 
                         never end.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no plans to call on you, 
                         Clarice, the world being more 
                         interesting with you in it. Be sure 
                         you extend me the same courtesy.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         You know I can't make that promise.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Goodbye, Clarice...
                              (and then, softly)
                         You looked - so very lovely today, 
                         in your blue suit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               As Clarice reacts, the fill weight of his words sinking in.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!

               But only a DIAL TONE comes from the phone. She is still 
               staring at her receiver, in shock, as we -

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. THE MOONLIT PATIO

               Dr. Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises. Popping 
               an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the 
               brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled 
               body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open 
               french doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BOOKLINED STUDY

               In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books, is the writhing figure of Dr. Frederick Chilton. The 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's own 
               former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights.

               DR. LECTER

               Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little 
               pen-knife. His eyes are twinkling.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, 
               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a 
               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, 
               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left 
               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.

               CLOSE ON

               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and 
               the door bursts open.

               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
               the ready in both hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the 
               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, 
               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled 
               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a 
               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...

               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze! FBI!

               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with 
               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his 
               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not 
               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...

               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS

               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use 
               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which 
               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, 
               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW 
               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, 
               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar 
               in these close quarters, but -

               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is 
               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still 
               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one 
               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case 
               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill 
               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal 
               ACTION and SOUND are restored.

                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)
                         Okay, people, good exercise...

               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten.

               PULLING BACK

               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel 
               room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM 
               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-
               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / 
               FBI Academy."

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Starling's reaction time was 
                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in 
                         five.

               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, 
               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. 

               Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her 
               "Hostage" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her 
               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both 
               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of 
               southern accent.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

                                     CLARICE
                              (indicating her gun)
                         Never cock. Just squeeze.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (grins)
                         I love it when you talk dirty.

               As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's 
               little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-
                         Man? She got off four rounds to your 
                         two.

               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her 
               palm.

                                     BRIGHAM
                              (continuing)
                         One hundred reps, each hand, every 
                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief 
                         wants to see you.

               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile 
               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.

               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD

               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He 
               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through 
               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one 
               arm.

               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof 
               vest, follows her worried gaze.

                                     CLARICE
                         What'd I do?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Stay cool. Just remember to call him 
                         "God."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY

               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, 
               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master 
               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Your instructors tell me you're doing 
                         well. Top quarter of the class.

                                     CLARICE
                         I hope so. They haven't posted 
                         anything.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         A job's come up and I thought about 
                         you. Not really a job, more of - an 
                         interesting errand. Walk me to my 
                         car, Starling.

               They begin to cross the academy grounds. A group of trainees 
               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're trying to interview all of the 
                         serial killers now in custody, for a 
                         psychobehavioral profile. Could be a 
                         big help in unsolved cases. Most of 
                         them have been happy to talk to us. 
                         They have a compulsion to boast, 
                         these people... Do you spook easily, 
                         Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You see, the one we want most refuses 
                         to cooperate. I want you to go after 
                         him again today, in the asylum.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who's the subject?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               Clarice stops walking, goes very still. A beat.

                                     CLARICE
                         The cannibal...

               Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad 
                         for the chance, sir, but - why me?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're qualified and available. And 
                         frankly, I can't spare a real agent 
                         right now.

               He walks on again, at a faster clip. She hurried to keep up.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I don't expect him to talk to you, 
                         but I have to be able to say we 
                         tried... Lecter was a brilliant 
                         psychiatrist, and he knows all the 
                         dodges.
                              (hands her the manila 
                              envelope)
                         Dossier on him, copy of our 
                         questionnaire, special ID for you... 
                         If he won't talk, then I want straight 
                         reporting. How's he look, how's his 
                         cell look, what's he writing? The 
                         Director himself will see your report, 
                         over your own signature - if I decide 
                         it's good enough. I want that by 
                         0800 Wednesday, and keep this to 
                         yourself.

               They're reached his car. His driver stamps on a cigarette, 
               climbs in behind the wheel. BURROUGHS, his assistant, says 
               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. 
               But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. His 
               intensity is scary.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Now. I want your full attention, 
                         Starling. Are you listening to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. 
                         Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go 
                         over the physical procedures used 
                         with him. Do not deviate from them, 
                         for any reason. You tell him nothing 
                         personal, Starling. Believe me, you 
                         don't want Hannibal Lecter inside 
                         your head... Just do your job, but 
                         never forget what he is.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit unnerved)
                         And what is that, sir?

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Oh, he's a monster. A pure 
                         psychopath...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE 
               CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               CLOSE ON an ID card held in a male hand. Clarice's photo, 
               official-looking graphics. It calls her a "Federal 
               Investigator."

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         It's so rare to capture one alive. 
                         From a research point of view, Dr. 
                         Lecter is our most prized asset...

               DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks up from her card. A smarmy little 
               peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, 
               hopeless letch for Clarice. He smiles, stroking her card 
               with his beloved gold pen.

                                     CHILTON
                         You know, we get a lot of detectives 
                         here, but I must say, I can't ever 
                         remember one so attractive...

               NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE

               now wearing a more feminine skirt suit. Hair neatly coiled, 
               elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. He has rudely left her 
               standing.

                                     CHILTON
                         Will you be in Baltimore overnight...? 
                         Because this can be quite a fun town, 
                         if you have the right guide.

               Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. 
                         Chilton, but my instructions are to 
                         talk to Lecter and report back this 
                         afternoon.

                                     CHILTON
                              (pause, sourly)
                         I see.
                              (beat)
                         Let's make this quick, then. I'm 
                         busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY

               Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate CLANGS shut behind 
               her, the bolt shooting home. Chilton walks ahead of her.

                                     CHILTON
                         Lecter carved up nine people - that 
                         we're sure of - and cooked his 
                         favorite bits. We've tried to study 
                         him, of course - but he's much too 
                         sophisticated for the standard tests. 
                         And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm 
                         his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, 
                         isn't he? Using you.

                                     CLARICE
                         How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?

                                     CHILTON
                         A pretty young woman, to turn him 
                         on? I don't believe Lecter's ever 
                         seen a woman in eight years. And oh, 
                         are you ever his "taste" - so to 
                         speak.

                                     CLARICE
                         I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. 
                         It's not a charm school.

                                     CHILTON
                         Good. Then you should be able to 
                         remember the rules.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY

               A darker, even grimmer area. Heavy grids over the lights. 
               Distant SLAMMINGS and faint, hoarse SHOUTS. They walk briskly.

                                     CHILTON
                         Do not reach through the bars, do 
                         not touch the bars. You pass him 
                         nothing but soft paper - no pens or 
                         pencils. No staples or paperclips in 
                         his paper. Use the sliding food 
                         carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept 
                         anything he attempts to hold out to 
                         you. Do you understand me?

                                     CLARICE
                         I understand.

                                     CHILTON
                         I'm going to show you why we insist 
                         on such precautions... On the 
                         afternoon of July 8, 1981, he 
                         complained of chest pains and was 
                         taken to the dispensary. His 
                         mouthpiece and restraints were removed 
                         for an EKG. When the nurse bent over 
                         him, he did this to her...

               He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, 
               she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton.

                                     CHILTON
                         The doctors managed to re-set her 
                         jaw, more or less, and save one of 
                         her eyes. His pulse never got over 
                         eighty-five, even when he ate her 
                         tongue.
                              (pauses, he smiles)
                         I keep him in here.

               He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, 
               and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an 
               anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, 
               tranquilizer guns.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quickly blocking him)
                         Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're 
                         his enemy - as you've said - then 
                         maybe I'll have more luck by myself. 
                         What do you think?

                                     CHILTON
                              (annoyed)
                         You might have suggested that in my 
                         office, and saved me the time.

                                     CLARICE
                         But then I would've missed the 
                         pleasure of your company.

               She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching.

                                     CHILTON
                         When she's finished, bring her out.

               He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't 
                         get near the bars?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaking his hand)
                         Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.

                                     BARNEY
                         Okay. Past the others, it's the last 
                         cell. Stay to the middle. I put out 
                         a chair for you.

               Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.

                                     BARNEY
                         I'm watching. You'll do fine.

               Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, 
               takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to 
               her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some 
               are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, 
               barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a 
               dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, 
               his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.

                                     DARK FIGURE
                         I c-can sssmell your cunt!

               Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.

               DR. LECTER'S CELL

               is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall 
               is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted-
               down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, 
               extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European 
               cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon.

               Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears 
               her throat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice 
                         Starling. May I talk with you?

               Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, 
               reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face 
               so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for 
               the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, 
               crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice 
               is cultured, soft.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good morning.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               as Clarice comes a measured distance closer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Doctor, we have a hard problem in 
                         psychological profiling. I want to 
                         ask for your help with a 
                         questionnaire.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "We" being the Behavioral Science 
                         Unit, at Quantico. You're one of 
                         Jack Crawford's, I expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         I am, yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         May I see your credentials?

               Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, 
               holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Closer, please... Clo-ser...

               She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's 
               nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. 
               Then he smiles, glancing at her card.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (continuing)
                         That expires in one week. You're not 
                         real FBI, are you?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm - still in training at the 
                         Academy.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         We're talking about psychology, 
                         Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide 
                         for yourself whether or not I'm 
                         qualified?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of 
                         you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

               She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely 
               till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Now then. What did Miggs say to you?
                              (she is puzzled)
                         "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. 
                         He hissed at you. What did he say?

                                     CLARICE
                         He said - "I can smell your cunt."

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan 
                         skin cream, and sometimes you wear 
                         L'Air du Temps, but not today. You 
                         brought your best bag, though, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         It's much better than your shoes.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe they'll catch up.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no doubt of it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shifting uncomfortably)
                         Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the 
                         Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

                                     CLARICE
                         All that detail, just from memory...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Memory, Officer Starling, is what I 
                         have instead of view.

               A pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, no, no. You were doing fine, 
                         you'd been courteous and receptive 
                         to courtesy, you'd established trust 
                         with the embarrassing truth about 
                         Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue 
                         into your questionnaire. It won't 
                         do. It's stupid and boring.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm only asking you to look at this, 
                         Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed 
                         if he's recruiting help from the 
                         student body. Busy hunting that new 
                         one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty 
                         boy! Did Crawford send you to ask 
                         for my advice on him?

                                     CLARICE
                         No, I came because we need -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How many women has he used, our Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                         Five... so far.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         All flayed...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's 
                         an active case, I'm not involved. If -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you know why he's called Buffalo 
                         Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't 
                         say.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll tell you if you'll look at this 
                         form.
                              (he considers, then 
                              nods)
                         It started as a bad joke in Kansas 
                         City Homicide. They said... this one 
                         likes to skin his humps.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Witless and misleading. Why do you 
                         think he takes their skins, Officer 
                         Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

                                     CLARICE
                         It excites him. Most serial killers 
                         keep some sort of trophies.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I didn't.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. You ate yours.

               A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Send that through.

               She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray. 
               He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, Officer Starling... do you think 
                         you can dissect me with this blunt 
                         little tool?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

               Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG 
               that makes her start. His voice remains a pleasant purr.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...? 
                         You know what you look like to me, 
                         with your good bag and your cheap 
                         shoes? You look like a rube. A well-
                         scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, 
                         taste... Good nutrition has given 
                         you some length of bone, but you're 
                         not more than one generation from 
                         poor white trash, are you Officer 
                         Starling...? That accent you're trying 
                         so desperately to shed - pure West 
                         Virginia. What was your father, dear? 
                         Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of 
                         the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the 
                         boys found you! All those tedious, 
                         sticky fumblings, in the back seats 
                         of cars, while you could only dream 
                         of getting out. Getting anywhere -
                         yes? Getting all the way - to the 
                         F...B...I.

               His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart. But 
               she squares her jaw and won't give ground.

                                     CLARICE
                         You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are 
                         you strong enough to point that high-
                         powered perception at yourself? How 
                         about it...? Look at yourself and 
                         write down the truth.
                              (she slams the tray 
                              back at him)
                         Or maybe you're afraid to.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're a tough one, aren't you?

                                     CLARICE
                         Reasonably so. Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And you'd hate to think you were 
                         common. My, wouldn't that sting! 
                         Well you're far from common, Officer 
                         Starling. All you have is the fear 
                         of it.
                              (beat)
                         Now please excuse me. Good day.

                                     CLARICE
                         And the questionnaire...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A census taker once tried to test 
                         me. I ate his liver with some fava 
                         beans and a nice chianti... Fly back 
                         to school, little Starling.

               He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as 
               still and remote as a statue. Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, 
               then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the 
               questionnaire in his tray. But after just a few steps, as 
               she passes -

               MIGG'S CELL

               She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.

                                     MIGGS
                         I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee! 
                         S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?

               The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -

               CLARICE

               is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with 
               pale droplets of semen. She gives a little cry, touching her 
               fingers to the wetness. Stunned, near tears, she forces 
               herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue. 
               From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Officer Starling... Officer Starling!

               Clarice slows, stops. She shudders, but makes the very 
               difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of -

               DR. LECTER

               Who's shivering with rage. For an instant his face opens, 
               and we catch a glimpse into hell itself. Then he's composed 
               again.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I would not have had that happen to 
                         you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably 
                         ugly to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then please - do this test for me.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. But I will make you happy... 
                         I'll give you a chance for what you 
                         love most, Clarice Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         What's that, Dr. Lecter?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Advancement, of course.
                              (beat)
                         Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an 
                         old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... 
                         Now go. Go.
                              (a smile)
                         I don't think Miggs could manage 
                         again so soon, even if he is crazy - 
                         do you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice 
               rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost 
               stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, 
               and finally, with some relief, spots -

               HER CAR

               an old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR...

               CLOSE ON

               her face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND 
               her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye -

               IN FLASHBACK

               a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year 
               old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the 
               front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -

               MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV

               a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, 
               Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, 
               and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, 
               seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...

               THE YOUNG CLARICE

               rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning 
               her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing 
               both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -

               THE ADULT CLARICE

               alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face 
               is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - 
               a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling 
               headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at

               A MOVING TARGET

               The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, 
               tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target 
               stops, quite close to her, still swaying.

               Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then 
               she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S 
               FOREHEAD.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. 
               Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New 
               Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.

               Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, 
               carrying an armful of books.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, Ardelia.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia 
               past high metal bookstacks.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You missed Fourth Amendment law. 
                         Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. 
                         Where were you all afternoon?

                                     CLARICE
                         Pleading with a crazy man, with come 
                         all over my face.

               Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn. Wish I had time for a social 
                         life.

               Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting 
               on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Mr. Crawford?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

               Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- 
               lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of 
               Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I've read your interim memo on Lecter. 
                         You sure you've left nothing out?

               INTERCUTTING

                                     CLARICE
                         It's all there, sir, practically 
                         verbatim.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit heatedly)
                         Right down to the kleenex I used.
                              (he is silent)
                         Sir, why? Is something wrong?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He mentioned a name, at the very 
                         end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

                                     CLARICE
                         I spent all evening on the mainframe. 
                         Lecter altered or destroyed most of 
                         his patient histories, prior to 
                         capture. No record of anyone named 
                         Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like 
                         it might have have something to do 
                         with divorce. I tracked it down in 
                         the library's catalogue of national 
                         yellow pages.
                              (glancing at her notes)
                         It's a mini-storage facility outside 
                         Baltimore, where Lecter had his 
                         practice.

               She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her 
               cleverness.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well? Why aren't you there right 
                         now?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, that's a field job. It's outside 
                         the scope of my assignment. And I've
                         got a test tomorrow on -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Do you recall my instructions to 
                         you, Starling? What were they?

                                     CLARICE
                         To complete and file my report by 
                         0800 Wednesday. But sir -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Then do that, Starling. Do just 
                         exactly that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, what is it? There's something 
                         you're not telling me.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Miggs has been murdered.

                                     CLARICE
                              (startled, upset)
                         Murdered...? How?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The orderly heard Lecter whispering 
                         to him, all afternoon, and Miggs 
                         crying. They found him at bed check. 
                         He'd swallowed his own tongue... 
                         Chilton is scared stiff the family 
                         will file a civil rights lawsuit, 
                         and he's trying to blame it on you. 
                         I told the little prick your conduct 
                         was flawless.
                              (beat)
                         Starling...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know 
                         how to feel about it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You don't have to feel any way about 
                         it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. 
                         Why not, what can they do? Take away 
                         his books for awhile, and no jello...
                              (a bit softer)
                         I know it got ugly today. But this 
                         is your report, Starling - take it 
                         as far as you can. On your own time, 
                         outside of class. Now carry on.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               as we hear the loud CLICK of Crawford hanging up. She stares 
               at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well God damn it! You old creep. 
                         Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs 
                         squirt you and see how you like it.

               She slams her receiver into its cradle.

               ANGLE ON CRAWFORD

               as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. He leaves 
               his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his 
               slippers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, 
               as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'll take over, Patricia. You get 
                         some rest.

               The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes. He glances at 
               it, then sets it aside. He crosses to -

               BELLA CRAWFORD

               who lies in an elevated hospital bed. Nearby are an oxygen 
               tank and mask, floral arrangements. Her breathing is shallow, 
               very labored. Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a 
               long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into 
               place, then bends over to kiss her forehead. SOUND UPCUT - 
               THUNDER and RAIN...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)

               An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out 
               location. It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed 
               wire. Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds.

                                     MR. YOW (V.O.)
                         Unit 31 was leased for ten years. 
                         Pre-paid in full... The contract is 
                         in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes 
               a FLASH photo of its sealed padlock. EVERETT YOW, a fat, 
               60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both. He looks 
               unhappy.

                                     CLARICE
                         So no one's been in here since - 
                         1980?

               She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then 
               sets aside both keys and lock.

                                     MR. YOW
                         Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a 
                         great concern to my customers. But, 
                         if you say this is an FBI matter...

                                     CLARICE
                         I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I 
                         promise. Be gone before you know it.

               Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, 
               but the door won't budge. Another tug, harder - no good. Mr. 
               Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck. He 
               sighs.

                                     MR. YOW
                         We could return tomorrow, with my 
                         son. Or perhaps some workmen...?

               Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches 
               in to turn on her headlights. Mr. Yow blinks in the sudden 
               brightness. Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and 
               returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor 
               mat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Would you hold these, please?

               She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on 
               the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the 
               center of the door. She pumps on the jack handle as the door 
               SQUEALS slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 
               inches, despite all her exertions. She spreads out the rubber 
               mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr. Yow, then 
               lies on the mat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice, backlit, peers under the door. She reaches in, makes 
               a sweep with her flashlight. We catch shadowy outlines - 
               boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...

               SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small 
               RUSTLINGS. Mr. Yow's chubby face appears down beside 
               Clarice's.

                                     MR. YOW
                         It smells like mice... I think I 
                         hear them, too - don't you?

               Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.

                                     MR. YOW
                         You're going in there?

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her 
               camera from him. She hands him a card, trying to appear 
               nonchalant.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow, if this door should fall
                         down -ha ha! - or anything else - 
                         would you be kind enough to call 
                         this number? It's our Baltimore field 
                         office. They know you're here with 
                         me... Do you understand?

                                     MR. YOW
                         Might I suggest tucking your pants 
                         into your socks? To prevent mouse 
                         intrusion.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Good idea.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As 
               she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal 
               edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight 
               on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Okay, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay, Mr. Yow...

               She shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see -

               CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING

               spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... 
               a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long 
               and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying 
               of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam 
               capturing... an old upright piano.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         That wasn't me.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh.

               Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, 
               but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away 
               cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, 
               she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending 
               with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, 
               she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting 
               clouds of dust make her cough.

               THE CAR

               is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite 
               the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, 
               but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.

               CLARICE

               peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.

               HER POV - SHIFTING

               as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... 
               as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled 
               lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, 
               high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin 
               evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.

               Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks 
                         like somebody is sitting in this 
                         car.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better 
                         come out now, Miss Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet! - just wait for me.
                              (under the breath)
                         Maybe in about two seconds.

               She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the 
               gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front 
               door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle 
               of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. 
               She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends 
               the tip into a hook.

               CLOSE ANGLE

               as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back 
               passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the 
               inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.

               Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't 
               open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her 
               flashlight.

               HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM

               revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in 
               white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other 
               atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands 
               of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white 
               neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head.

               CLARICE

               sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then 
               very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by 
               the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases 
               herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK 
               loudly.

               ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. 

               Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. 
               She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic 
               elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as 
               she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening 
               bag's drawstring.

               A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded 
               material slides away.

               Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart-
               pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more 
               closely.

               The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory 
               specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, 
               by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, 
               into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared 
               badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.

               CLARICE

               staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself 
               quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas 
                         anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)

               A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates 
               the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs 
               through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard 
               admits her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)

               On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his 
               arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

               PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on 
               the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been 
               stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.

                                     CLARICE
                         Hester Mofet... "The rest of me." 
                         Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you 
                         rented that place.

               HER POV

               he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. He doesn't respond.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.

                                     CLARICE
                         You put those - things in there. 
                         Paid for it in advance, ten years 
                         ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?

               The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making 
               her jump up. In its tray is a clean, folded white towel. She 
               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               She sits again, rubbing her wet hair. When he finally speaks, 
               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the 
               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your bleeding has stopped.

                                     CLARICE
                         How did -
                              (she stops herself)
                         It's nothing. A scratch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why don't you ask me about Buffalo 
                         Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised, a beat)
                         Why? Do you know something about 
                         him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I might if I saw the case file. You 
                         could get that for me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Why don't you tell me about "Miss 
                         Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. 
                         Or do I have to wait for the lab?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sighs)
                         His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A 
                         former patient of mine, whose romantic 
                         attachments ran to, shall we say, 
                         the exotic...? I didn't kill him, 
                         merely tucked him away. Very much as 
                         I found him, in that ridiculous car, 
                         in his own garage, after he's missed 
                         three appointments. You'd have him 
                         under "Missing Person" - which, in 
                         poor Raspail's case, could hardly be 
                         more true.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't kill him, then who 
                         did?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who can say...? Best thing for him, 
                         really. His therapy was going nowhere.

                                     CLARICE
                         Wouldn't it have been easier to just 
                         leave him for the police to find?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And have them clomping about in my 
                         life? Oh dear, no... At that time I 
                         still had certain private amusements 
                         of my own.
                              (beat)
                         How did you feel when you saw him, 
                         Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

                                     CLARICE
                         Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Ahhh... Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         Because you weren't wasting my time.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you have something you use, when 
                         you need to get up your courage? 
                         Memories, tableaux... scenes from 
                         your early life?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Next time I'll have to 
                         check.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford is helping your career, 
                         isn't he? Apparently he likes you. 
                         And you like him, too.

                                     CLARICE
                         I never thought about it.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your first lie to me, Clarice. How 
                         sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford 
                         wants you, sexually? True, he's much 
                         older, but - do you think he 
                         visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? 
                         Fucking you?

                                     CLARICE
                         That doesn't interest me, Doctor. 
                         And it's the sort of thing Miggs 
                         would ask.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not anymore.
                              (beat)
                         Surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford 
                         dangles you before me. Then I give 
                         you a bit of help. Do you think it's 
                         because I like to look at you, and 
                         imagine how good you would taste...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Is it?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Or doesn't this all begin to suggest 
                         to you a kind of... negotiation? 
                         There's something Crawford can give 
                         me, and I want to trade for it. I 
                         even wrote to him, offering my help. 
                         But he hates me, so he won't deal 
                         directly.

               Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. As his 
               lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. Gone 
               are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. 
               She stands, too, startled. They face each other.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just 
                         like that gospel program. When you 
                         leave, they'll turn the volume way 
                         up. Chilton does enjoy his petty 
                         torments.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You 
                         know, don't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've been in this room for eight 
                         years, Clarice. I know they will 
                         never, ever let me out while I'm 
                         alive. What I want is a view. I want 
                         a window where I can see a tree, or 
                         even water. I want to be in a federal 
                         institution, away from Chilton - and 
                         I want a view. I'll give good value 
                         for it. Crawford could do that for 
                         me, but he won't. You persuade him.

                                     CLARICE
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Who killed your patient?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you 
                         and Jack Crawford are most anxious 
                         to meet.

                                     CLARICE
                         Buffalo Bill...?
                              (incredulous)
                         Bill killed him, all those years 
                         ago...? That's impossible.

               But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who is he stalking right now, Clarice? 
                         I wonder, don't you? How many more 
                         young women will have to die, before 
                         you trade with me...?

               As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - 
               NIGHT

               CATHERINE MARTIN takes a long toke from a bong pipe. She is 
               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown 
               fair. Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, CODY; they're 
               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished 
               apartment. The TV in on, with low SOUND.

                                     CATHERINE
                         This stuff's givin' me the munchies. 
                         Where's that bag of popcorn?

                                     CODY
                         Shit. Left the groceries in the car.

               He starts to rise, but she pushes him back.

                                     CATHERINE
                         'S okay, I'll go.

               She rises, goes out the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

               Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting 
               her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away -

               A MAN

               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His 
               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, 
               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked 
               nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast-
               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 

               Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Help you with that?

                                     MAN
                         Would you? Thanks.

               His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on 
               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't 
               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above 
               average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, 
               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Let's slide it up, you mind?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT

               He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, 
               and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after 
               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.

                                     MAN
                         Are you about a size 14?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (surprised)
                         What?

               Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of 
               her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding 
               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his 
               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, 
               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. 
               He bends over her face with the lamp.

               We hear her shallow BREATHING.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size 
               tag.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of 
               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no 
               bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.

                                     MAN
                         Gooood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse 
               is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. 
               The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, 
               partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights 
               shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY

               CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually 
               sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.

                         Electron microscopy reveals fiber 
                         "signatures" that are nearly as 
                         distinct as fingerprints...

               Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia 
               is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. 
               Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but 
               straightens, hearing -

                         Both of these blouses were worn by 
                         victims of Buffalo Bill. They were 
                         found in two different states, and 
                         four months apart. He always slits 
                         them up the back, like a funeral 
                         suit...

               ON THE SCREEN

               successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we 
               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts 
               match.

                         The bunching you see - this 
                         compression - is characteristic of 
                         scissor cuts, rather than a single 
                         blade. And, as you see - Bill always 
                         uses the same pair...

                         Clarice Starling! Are you in here?

               Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other 
               trainees. He carries a small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Get your field gear, take stuff for 
                         overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where?

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Some fishermen in West Virginia found 
                         an unidentified girl's body. It's a 
                         Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in 
                         the water about a week, and Jack 
                         needs somebody that can print a 
                         floater. Think you can handle it?

                                     CLARICE
                              (thinking quickly)
                         I'll need the big fingerprint kit... 
                         and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-
                         5, with film packs and batteries.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING)

               Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an 
               airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend 
               bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't 
                         he? Impatient...

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         He's got a lot on his mind besides 
                         Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is 
                         real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' 
                         you about it now, 'cause he may never.

               Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, 
               rather dilapidated Beechcraft. Its door is open, the twin 
               props and beacons already turning. Brigham turns to her, 
               holding out his small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         You're goin' in the field, so you 
                         gotta have full kit. Take this - 
                         it's my own...

               Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in 
               its shoulder holster. She looks up at him, touched.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Wear it, don't ever leave it in your 
                         purse. Dry fire it whenever you get 
                         the chance. And do your exercises.

                                     CLARICE
                         I will... I promise.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Listen, I hope you never need a thing 
                         I've taught you. But you've got 
                         something... Jack sees it, I do too. 
                         If you ever need to, you can shoot.

               She nods, climbs out. Then she looks back in at him. They're 
               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Bless you, Starling...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEECHCRAFT PLANE - DAY (FLYING)

               CLARICE'S POV - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far 
               below. Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.

               Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in 
               her lap. The cover reads "Case File: / BUFFALO BILL." Clarice 
               is moody, distracted. She hesitates, then opens the file, 
               begins to scan.

               INSERTS - HER POV

               Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch 
               words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"... 
               Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched 
               grooves... And then a stack of victim photos. The first one, 
               taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, 
               face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.

               Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at 
               the next. It makes her flinch, just slightly. Quickly she 
               turns through several more photographs, trying hard to 
               concentrate.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         He keeps them alive for three days.

               NEW ANGLE

               shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's 
               motion. Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back. 
               Crawford sits, removing sunglasses. He rubs his eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why, we don't yet know... There's no 
                         evidence of rape or physical abuse 
                         prior to death. All the mutilation 
                         you see there is post-mortem.
                              (a beat; he glances 
                              at her)
                         I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's 
                         too damned hot back here...

               The pilot adjusts a valve. Crawford turns to her again.

                         So. Three days. Then he shoots them,
                         skins them - usually just the torsos - 
                         and dumps them. Each body in a 
                         different river, in a different state, 
                         downstream from an interstate highway. 
                         The water leaves us no fingerprints, 
                         fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence 
                         at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the 
                         first one...

               A COLOR PHOTO - IN CLARICE'S HANDS

               shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school 
               graduation cap and gown. She smiles at us with touching 
               optimism.

                         A big girl, like all the rest. Went 
                         about 160... Her corpse was the only 
                         one he took the trouble to weight 
                         down, so actually, she was the third 
                         girl found. After her, he got lazy...

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved. Crawford pulls 
               a map from the file, spreads it out. It shows the central 
               and eastern U.S., with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings.

                         Blue triangle where her body was 
                         found - down here in Missouri. Same 
                         marks for the other four girls, in 
                         different colors. This new one, 
                         today... washed up here.

                              pen)
                         Elk River, in West Virginia, about 
                         six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

                         There's no correlation at all between 
                         where they're kidnapped and where 
                         they're found...?
                              (he shakes his head)
                         What if - what if you trace the 
                         heaviest-traffic routes backwards 
                         from the dump sites? Do they converge 
                         at all?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea, but he thought of it, 
                         too. We've run simulations, using 
                         different vectors and the best dates 
                         we can assign. You put it all in the 
                         computer, and smoke comes out. No, 
                         this one is different. This one has 
                         seen us coming...

               He glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.

                         Talk about him, Starling. Tell me

                              carefully)
                         He's a white male... Serial killers 
                         tend to hunt within their own ethnic 
                         group. And he's not a drifter - he's 
                         got his own house, somewhere. Not an 
                         apartment.

                         What he does with them - takes 
                         privacy... Time, tools... He's in 
                         his 30's or 40's - he's got real 
                         physical strength, but combined with 
                         an older man's self-control. He's 
                         cautious, precise, never impulsive... 
                         This won't end in suicide, like they 
                         often do.

                         He's got a real taste for it now. 
                         And he's getting better at his work.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (a beat; impressed)
                         Maybe you've got a knack for this... 
                         I guess we're about to find out.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

               He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.

                         Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

                         You haven't said a word today about 
                         that garage. Or what I found there.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What should I say? You did fine work. 
                         We'll wait on the lab.

                                     CLARICE
                         You knew. You knew from the start 
                         that Lecter held the key to this... 
                         But you weren't up front with me. 
                         You sent me in to him naked.

                         He starts this - buzzing in me, in 
                         my head. He makes me feel violated... 
                         You used me, Mr. Crawford.

               A shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers 
               sternly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number One. Maybe there's a 
                         connection, maybe not. Lying and 
                         breathing are the same thing to 
                         Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you 
                         in there with something to hide from 
                         him, he'd have known it, instantly. 
                         He'd never have trusted you.

               She starts to answer, then is silent. He is right.

               By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree-
               lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in 
               the background. They slow, turn.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number Three, I didn't bring you 
                         along today just because you can do 
                         first-rate forensics. If Lecter is 
                         becoming part of this case, you've 
                         got the most current read on him. 
                         And Number Four - you don't have to 
                         like me, or the way I do things. But 
                         you do have to keep a cool head. 
                         Especially now... Because from here 
                         on out, you'll know everything I do. 
                         Are we straight on that?

               Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's 
               likely to get. She stares out the windshield.

               JUST AHEAD OF THEM

               the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other 
               police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads 
               "Potter Funeral Home." Two troopers climb from the car.

               Crawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, 
               removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (softly)
                         You think about him long enough, you 
                         get a feel for him... Then, if you're 
                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, 
                         one little part of it tugs at you, 
                         tries to get your attention... You 
                         let me know when that happens, 
                         Starling. Live right behind your 
                         eyes, today. Don't try to impose any 
                         patterns on this guy. Just stay open 
                         and let him show you...

               One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, 
               peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, 
               then turns back to Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         School's out, Starling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY

               SOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint 
               kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing -

               COUNTRY PEOPLE

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing 
               from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance 
               over at her curiously.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense 
               memory is triggered in her...

               IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from 
               the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We 
               Gather...?"

               THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE

               in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. 
               Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

               CHILD'S POV

               on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally 
               she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, 
               his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Starling...?

               NEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY)

               as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. 
               Like her, he carries a large case.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're around back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY

               A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are 
               all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered 
               corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing 
               machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is 
               closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... 
                         This is Officer Starling. We 
                         appreciate your phoning us.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (grim, unsociable)
                         I didn't call you. That was somebody 
                         from the state attorney's office... 
                         'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' 
                         find out if this girl's local. It 
                         could just be somethin' that outside 
                         elements has dumped on us.

               He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well sir, that's where we can help. 
                         If -

                                     SHERIFF
                         I don't even know you, Mister... Now 
                         we'll extend you ever courtesy, just
                         soon as we can, but for right now -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex 
                         crime has some aspects I'd rather 
                         discuss just between the two of us. 
                         Know what I mean?

               He indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, 
               nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, 
               closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there.

               CLARICE

               burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who 
               peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit 
               tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.

               ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR

               as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. 
               The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the 
                         chapel. And tell Lamar to come on 
                         when he's done playin' that music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY

               Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton 
               Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low 
               voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak 
               loudly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, 
                         Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, 
                         Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can 
                         you hear me...?

               He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.

               CLARICE

               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, 
               turning up her natural accent by several notches.

                                     CLARICE
                         Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! 
                         Listen here a minute, please. There's 
                         things I need to do for her...

               WIDER ANGLE

               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies 
               and troopers. They gradually fall silent, looking at her.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         Y'all brought her this far, and I 
                         know her folks would thank you if 
                         they could. Now please - go on out 
                         and let me take care of her... Go 
                         on, now.

               The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin 
               to to file out, whispering among themselves. As they go, a 
               bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on 
               a porcelain embalming table. It is almost the only modern 
               object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets 
               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.

               FAVORING CRAWFORD

               as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect. Men 
               brush by him, till finally only two are left: DR. AKIN, a 
               family g.p., and LAMAR, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. 
               SOUND of the door closing. Lamar dabs around his nostrils 
               with Vicks VapoRub.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone)
                         We're starting. Tell everybody to 
                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.

               CLARICE

               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint 
               kit. She is lifting out a camera when she hears the ZIPPER 
               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...

               One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, 
               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. She blinks at her 
               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, 
               look at the corpse.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; softly)
                         Bill...

               She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a FLASH 
               photo.

               LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP, FROM BENEATH TABLE

               as Dr. Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. 
               A piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged 
               around it, dangling. Crawford leans in for a closer look.

                                     DR. AKIN
                         Wrongful death... She'll have to go 
                         to the state pathologist at Claxton 
                         when you're done.
                              (Crawford nods)
                         I better - get on back for the rest 
                         of that service. Lamar'll help you.
                              (shaken)
                         Lord almighty...

               He leaves, and Clarice leans INTO SHOT, taking another photo.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What do you see, Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, she's not local. Her ears are 
                         pierced three times each, and she's 
                         wearing green glitter nail polish. 
                         Looks like town to me...

               CLOSE ANGLE

               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the 
               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         She waxed her legs, I think... A big 
                         girl, just like the others - but she 
                         was careful about her appearance...

               UPWARD ANGLE AGAIN

               as Lamar joins them for a closer look.

                                     CLARICE
                         Two of the fingernails are broken 
                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under 
                         the others. She tried to claw her 
                         way through something... I'll scrape 
                         out samples after I've printed her.

               She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.

                                     LAMAR
                         Them fishhooks are set too close 
                         together. No wonder the Franklin 
                         boys was scared to say they found 
                         her.

                                     CLARICE
                         Think they were runnin' a trotline?

               Crawford and Lamar both look at her curiously.

                                     CLARICE
                              (to Crawford)
                         It's a Fish and Game violation. Like 
                         poaching. There's a big fine.

                                     LAMAR
                         Right... Are you from around here?

                                     CLARICE
                         They do it lots of places.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll 
                         fax her fingerprints to Washington, 
                         try to trace her through Missing 
                         Persons.

               SIDE ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DEAD GIRL'S FACE

               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. Clarice sets the 
               Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, 
               while Lamar gently retracts the lips. Each time the camera 
               FLASHES, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.

               NEW ANGLE - CHEST HIGH

               as Clarice examines a developing print.

                                     CLARICE
                         She's got something in her throat.

               She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as 
               she searches in her kit.

                                     LAMAR
                         When a body comes out of the water, 
                         alots of times there's like, leaves 
                         and things in the mouth.

               Clarice holds up a pair of forceps. She glances at Crawford, 
               who nods. She bends over, partially OUT OF SHOT, and after a 
               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical 
               object. She turns this in the air, as they all stare.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What is it - some kind of seed pod?

                                     LAMAR
                         Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how 
                         come that to get way down in there? 
                         'Less somebody shoved it in...

               Clarice and Crawford exchange a glance.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She'll be easier to print if we turn 
                         her over. Lamar, will you give me a 
                         hand?

                                     LAMAR
                         Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar 
                         from her kit, carefully drops the 
                         cocoon inside.

               SOUND of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, 
               off screen. She seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Starling - what do you make of these?

               She turns to look.

               HER POV

               low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, 
               triangular patches of skin are missing.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks at Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. I didn't see those on 
                         any of the other girls...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         They weren't there. Get close-ups.

               Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY

               Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. 
               She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of 
               Coke.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

                                     LAMAR
                         No, hold it under your chin, there, 
                         and on your temples. Cold'll make 
                         you feel better. It does me.

               She smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees 
               Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits 
               beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself 
               with the can.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When I told that sheriff we shouldn't 
                         talk in front of a woman, that really 
                         burned you, didn't it?
                              (she is silent)
                         That was just smoke, Starling, I had 
                         to get rid of him. You did well in 
                         there.

                                     CLARICE
                         It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other 
                         cops know who you are. They look at 
                         you to see how to act... It matters.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Point taken.

               She looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When we get back, I want you to run 
                         that bug by the Smithsonian, see if 
                         they can identify it. Maybe it's got 
                         some limited range, or it only breeds 
                         at certain times of year... You found 
                         it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm wondering if he's done that before - 
                         placed a cocoon, or an insect. It 
                         would be easy to miss in an autopsy, 
                         especially with a floater... Can we 
                         check back on that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         The other girls are in the ground. 
                         Exhumations are upsetting for the 
                         families. I'll do it if I have to,
                         but -

                                     CLARICE
                         Then have the lab check Raspail's 
                         head.
                              (he looks at her)
                         Dr. Lecter's patient - have them 
                         probe his soft-palette tissues... 
                         They'll find another cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You seem pretty sure of that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Raspail was killed by the same man 
                         who's killing these girls. And Lecter 
                         knows him. Maybe even treated him... 
                         You think so, too, don't you? Or 
                         you'd never have sent me to that 
                         asylum.

               He looks at her for a moment, then sips again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Before we caught him, Lecter had a 
                         big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. 
                         But he traveled all over the country - 
                         teaching, consulting... Christ, even 
                         testifying in murder trials. Who 
                         knows how many potential psychos he 
                         turned loose, just for the fun of 
                         it...?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               A shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the 
               edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his 
               arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka "Buffalo Bill."

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it 
                         in gooood...

               CATHERINE MARTIN

               looks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the 
               pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit 
               is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, 
               from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's 
               soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle 
               of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister... my family will pay cash. 
                         Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
                         they -

               REVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose 
                         again.

               The little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It 
                         will get the hose!

               SIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM

               as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (under her breath)
                         Oh God... oh God...

               She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the 
               lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister, if you let me go, I won't 
                         press charges, I promise. You've 
                         only had me here a couple days, and -

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         No. Just one day...

                                     CATHERINE
                         Is that all...? See - see, my mom is 
                         a real important woman... Well, I 
                         guess you already know that. She'll 
                         pay you, no questions asked. Whatever 
                         cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - 
                         she'll see that -

               A sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, 
               shielding her eyes.

               HER POV

               a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Put the bottle in the basket. No 
                         funny business, or you'll be sorry...

               NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE

               as the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips 
               the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe 
               of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to 
               scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand 
               hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on 
               the concrete walls, all around her -

               BLOODY FINGER TRACKS

               dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - FBI ACADEMY - DAWN

               Clarice is at her desk, exercising her right hand with the 
               grip flexer, while simultaneously studying a thick law book. 
               Ardelia sticks her head in the door, excited.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You better come see this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON a TV screen, filled with a photo of Catherine Martin.

                                     TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
                         ...was listed at first simply as a 
                         missing person, but is now believed 
                         to have been kidnapped by the serial 
                         killer known only as "Buffalo Bill."

               The photo disappears, replaced by the TV ANCHOR himself.

                         Memphis Police sources indicate that 
                         the missing girl's blouse has been 
                         identified, sliced up the back, in 
                         what has become a kind of grim calling 
                         card. Young Catherine Martin, as 
                         we've said, is the only daughter of 
                         U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -

               CLARICE

               looks at Ardelia, surprised. Other trainees are drifting 
               into the rec room, some whispering among themselves. Clarice 
               stares back at the TV intently.

                                     TV ANCHOR (O.S.)

                         kidnapping is not at this point 
                         considered to be politically 
                         motivated, nevertheless it has stirred 
                         the government -

                         and I quote, "intensely concerned." 
                         Just moments ago, Senator Martin 
                         made this dramatic personal plea...

               SENATOR MARTIN (TV FOOTAGE)

               fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to 
               a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her 
               Georgetown home. A tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, 
               taut face.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         I'm speaking now to the person who 
                         is holding my daughter. Her name is 
                         Catherine... You have the power to 
                         let Catherine go, unharmed. She's 
                         very gentle and kind - talk to her 
                         and you'll see. Her name is 
                         Catherine...

               Clarice is moved by what she sees. Other trainees are all 
               around her.

                         Somebody's coaching her... They're 
                         trying to make him see Catherine as 
                         a person - not just an object.

                         I don't know whether to say "I'm 
                         sorry," or "Congratulations." But 
                         girl? - you just went prime time.

               The massive Victorian building looms over Constitution Avenue. 
               Clarice quickly mounts the steps, carrying a small plastic 
               box.

                         I don't think he knew that she's a 
                         Senator's child. She's a big girl, 
                         Starling, like all the rest. We're 
                         going on the theory she was randomly 
                         targeted by size...

               Clarice, now accompanied by a museum guard, walks through an 
               eerie landscape of dinosaur bones - crouching skeletons with 
               blank eye sockets, gaping fangs.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours. 
                         That leaves us just 36 more, before 
                         he kills her... But maybe, just maybe, 
                         Starling, we caught a real break 
                         this time - thanks to you.
                              (beat)

               CLOSE ON an live, enormous, rhinoceros beetle, as it weaves 
               its clumsy way among the men on a chessboard, before finally 
               stepping off the edge, onto a lettuce leaf.

                                     RODEN (V.O.)
                         Time, Pilch! My move.

                                     PILCHER (V.O.)
                         No fair! You lured him with produce.

               shows two entomologists, both 30ish, hunched over the board. 
               RODEN is a pudgy redhead; PILCHER is lean, quite handsome.

                                     RODEN
                         Tough noogies! It's still my turn.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         If the beetle moves one of your men, 
                         does that count?

               They look up, delighted to see Clarice in the doorway. Both 
               men are hopelessly smitten by her.

                                     RODEN
                         Of course it counts. How do you play?

                                     PILCHER
                              (grins)
                         Officer Starling. Welcome back.

               MOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a 
               hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. 
               Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box.

                                     RODEN
                         Where the hell did this one come 
                         from? It's practically mush.

                                     CLARICE
                         You really don't want to know.

                                     PILCHER
                         Your West Virginia specimen gave us 
                         quite a bit of trouble, but I finally 
                         managed to narrow his species through 
                         chaetaxy - studying the skin.

                                     RODEN
                         I'm the one who found his perforating 
                         proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, 
                         right now?
                              (Clarice nods)
                         Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               chrysalis.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         The whole trick is to remove the 
                         chrysalis without destroying it... 
                         The wings are just like wet tissue 
                         paper...

               THE TWO MEN

               are hunched over a formica table, peering through square 
               magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. 
               Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better 
               condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on 
               towel paper.

                                     PILCHER
                              (without looking up)
                         What do you do when you're not 
                         detecting, Officer Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

                                     PILCHER
                         Ever get out for cheeseburgers and 
                         beer? The amusing house wine...?

                                     CLARICE
                              (smiles)
                         Not lately. But maybe someday.

               He looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between 
               them, before Roden straightens, exultant.

                                     RODEN
                         Positive match!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're sure?

                                     RODEN
                              (points with his dental 
                              probe)
                         West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer 
                         Starling, meet Mister Acherontia 
                         Styx.

               He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's 
               specimen. She leans forward, intently.

               HER POV (MAGNIFICATION)

               the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right 
               between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is 
               nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         Better known to his friends as the 
                         Death's-head Moth...

                                     PILCHER (O.S.)
                         The Latin name comes from two rivers 
                         in Hell. Your man - he drops these 
                         girls into rivers, every time. Didn't 
                         I read that?

               FAVORING CLARICE

               as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         And there's no way - no natural way - 
                         these could've wound up in the bodies?

                                     PILCHER
                              (shakes his head)
                         They live in Malaysia. In this 
                         country, they'd have to be specially 
                         raised, from imported eggs.

               CLARICE AND CRAWFORD

               sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice 
               can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, 
               awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         But for Catherine Martin, it all 
                         comes down to you and Lecter. You're 
                         the one he talks to.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's already offered to help... What 
                         would happen if we just showed our 
                         cards - asked him for Bill?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He offered to help, Starling, not to 
                         snitch. That wouldn't give him enough 
                         chance to show off. Remember, Lecter 
                         looks mainly for fun. Never forget 
                         fun.

                                     CLARICE
                         But if he knew we have so little 
                         time -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If we act too anxious, he'll make us 
                         wait. He'll let the Senator keep 
                         hoping, day after day, until Catherine 
                         finally washes up. That'd be the 
                         most fun of all.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think he means it, this time. I 
                         think he'll deal.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What would it take?

                                     CLARICE
                         Transfer to a new prison. With a 
                         view of trees, he said, or even 
                         water... Can we swing that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         State to federal jurisdiction... We 
                         can do it - eventually - but we'll 
                         never get all the clearances in time. 
                         Can you convince him a deal's already 
                         in place?

                                     CLARICE
                         You'll back me up with some paperwork?
                              (he nods)
                         Then I'll try. But wouldn't this 
                         have more weight coming from the 
                         Senator herself?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (hesitates)
                         She doesn't know what we're up to. 
                         And we can't afford to let her find 
                         out.

               Clarice looks at him, surprised.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She's the mother, Starling. She can't 
                         possibly comprehend what Lecter is. 
                         She'd make the mistake of pleading 
                         with him. Begging him... He'd feast 
                         on her pain till the last second of 
                         that girl's life...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BALTIMORE STATE HOSP. FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the 
               administration wing. He looks quite agitated.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         We can't trust Frederick Chilton, 
                         either. He's greedy and ambitious. 
                         If he knew about Lecter's link to 
                         Bill, he's go straight to the 
                         newspapers...

               Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase. 
               He points his gold pen at her accusingly.

                                     CHILTON
                         What you're doing, Miss Starling, is 
                         coming into my hospital to conduct 
                         an interview, and refusing to share 
                         information with me. For the third 
                         time!

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is 
                         just routine follow-up on the Raspail 
                         case.

                                     CHILTON
                         He's my patient! I have rights!
                              (grabs her arm, 
                              stopping her)
                         I'm not just some turnkey, Miss 
                         Starling. I shouldn't even be here 
                         this afternoon. I had a ticket to 
                         Holiday on Ice.

               She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm acting on instruction, Dr. 
                         Chilton.
                              (handing him a card)
                         This is the U.S. Attorney's number. 
                         Now please - either discuss this 
                         with him, or let me do my job.

               She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and 
               hostility. He clicks his pen, watching her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - DAY

               Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with 
               charcoal on butcher paper.

               He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other 
               drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for 
                         a United States Senator, you're an 
                         odd choice of messenger?

               Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers 
               from her briefcase.

                                     CLARICE
                         I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You 
                         chose to speak to me. Would you prefer 
                         someone else now? Or perhaps you 
                         don't think you can help us.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That is both impudent and untrue... 
                         Tell me, how did you feel when you 
                         viewed our Billy's latest effort?
                              (beat; he smiles)
                         Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

                                     CLARICE
                         By the book, he's a sadist.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Life's too slippery for books, 
                         Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from 
                         the same God.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was 
                         she a large girl?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Big through the hips. Roomy.

                                     CLARICE
                         They all were.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmm. And what else...?

                                     CLARICE
                         She had an insect deliberately 
                         inserted in her throat. That hasn't 
                         been made public yet. We don't know 
                         what is means.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Was it a butterfly?

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; staring at 
                              him)
                         A moth... How did you predict that?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. 
                         Enchant me.

               Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect 
               her thoughts. She looks up at him again, evenly.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you help us find Buffalo Bill in 
                         time to save Catherine Martin, the 
                         Senator promises you a transfer to 
                         the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, 
                         New York, with a view of the woods 
                         nearby. Maximum security still 
                         applies, but you'd have reasonable 
                         access to books.

               He is silent. She rises, moves closer, carrying papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Best of all, though - one week a 
                         year you'd get to leave the hospital 
                         and go here.
                              (points to a map)
                         Plum Island. Every afternoon of that 
                         week you can walk on the beach or 
                         swim in the ocean for up to one hour. 
                         Under SWAT team surveillance, of 
                         course...

               His face remains neutral. She puts the papers in his food 
               tray.

                                     CLARICE
                         Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, 
                         copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her 
                         offer is final and non-negotiable. 
                         If Catherine dies -
                              (she slides his tray 
                              through)
                         You get nothing.

               A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks 
               down at the papers, without touching them.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "Plum Island Animal Disease Research 
                         Center." Sounds charming.

                                     CLARICE
                         That's just part of the island. It 
                         has a very nice beach. Terns nest 
                         there.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it 
                         will be "turns" with us, too. Quid 
                         pro quo. I tell you things, you tell 
                         me things. Not about this case, though - 
                         about yourself. Yes or no?
                              (she is silent)
                         Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is 
                         waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

               She looks at him. A beat. They are standing uncomfortably 
               close.

                                     CLARICE
                         Go, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What's your worst memory of childhood?
                              (she hesitates)
                         Quicker than that. I'm not interested 
                         in your worst invention.

                                     CLARICE
                         The death of my father.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

               Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She 
               looks past him, hesitating again.

                                     CLARICE
                         He was a town marshal... one night 
                         he surprised two burglars, coming 
                         out the back of a drugstore... They 
                         shot him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Killed outright?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He was strong, he lasted almost 
                         a month. My mother - died when I was
                         very young, so my father had become - 
                         the whole world to me... After he 
                         left me, I had nobody. I was ten 
                         years old.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're very frank, Clarice. I think - 
                         it would be quite something to know 
                         you in private life.

                                     CLARICE
                         Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The significance of the moth is 
                         change. Caterpillar into cocoon into 
                         beauty... Billy wants to change, 
                         too, Clarice. But there's the problem 
                         of his size, you see. Even if he 
                         were a woman, he'd have to be a big 
                         one...

                                     CLARICE
                              (puzzled)
                         Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation 
                         in the literature between 
                         transsexualism and violence. 
                         Transsexuals are very passive.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clever girl. You're so close to the 
                         way you're going to catch him - do 
                         you realize that?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. Tell me why.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         After your father's death, you were 
                         orphaned. What happened next?
                              (Clarice drops her 
                              gaze)
                         I don't imagine the answer's on those 
                         second-rate shoes, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                         I went to live with my mother's cousin 
                         and her husband in Montana. They had 
                         a ranch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A cattle ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Horses - and sheep...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How long did you live there?

                                     CLARICE
                         Two months.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why so briefly?

                                     CLARICE
                         I - ran away...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (angrily)
                         No.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did he try to?

                                     CLARICE
                         No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Billy's not a real transsexual, but 
                         he thinks he is. He tries to be. 
                         He's tried to be a lot of things, I 
                         expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         You said - I was very close to the 
                         way we'd catch him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         There are three major centers for 
                         transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, 
                         the University of Minnesota, and 
                         Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't 
                         be surprised if Billy has applied 
                         for sex reassignment at one or all 
                         of them, and been rejected.

                                     CLARICE
                         On what basis would they reject him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The personality inventories would 
                         trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, 
                         House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't 
                         test like a real transsexual.

                                     CLARICE
                         How would he test?

               Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take 
               a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement 
               into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. 
                         Oh, and Clarice - next time you will 
                         tell me why you ran away. Shall I 
                         summarize?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaken)
                         Yes, Doctor. Please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               VERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living 
               Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free. Trembling and 
               damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         You should try to obtain a list of 
                         males rejected from all three gender 
                         reassignment centers...

               PULLING BACK

               we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They 
               crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings 
               pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous 
               SOUND of show music.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Check first the ones rejected for 
                         lying about criminal records...

               CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE

               at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL 
               through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.

               As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the 
               dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom 
               briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... 
               a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming 
               knives...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Among those who tried to conceal 
                         their past, look for severe childhood 
                         disturbances, associated with 
                         violence... Possibly you'll find a 
                         childhood incarceration... Then go 
                         to their personality tests...

               We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing 
               colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various 
               stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese 
               lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty 
               background.

               MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye 
               Baby." And now we hear something else, too - the rapid 
               CLICKING of a sewing machine...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Study their drawings, especially. 
                         Billy's house drawings will show no 
                         happy future... No baby carriage, 
                         out in the yard. No pets, no toys, 
                         no flowers, no sun...

               We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we 
               APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old-
               fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a 
               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female 
               wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a 
               beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         His females will be more crudely 
                         sketched than him males - but he'll 
                         compensate by adding exaggerated 
                         adornments... jewelry, big breasts... 
                         And his tree drawings - oh, his trees 
                         will be frightful...

               Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the 
               MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. 
               As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting 
               happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, 
               the music starting to fade behind us...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy hates his own identity, he 
                         always has - and he thinks that makes 
                         him a transsexual. But his pathology 
                         is a thousand times more savage... 
                         He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He 
                         will be reborn...

               At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a 
               low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in 
               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. 
               Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail 
               wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly 
               moan from below.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         Pleeeeeeeease.....!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, which 
               rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. RISING along his 
               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel 
               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are 
               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a 
               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Bad news, Hannibal...

               WIDER ANGLE

               shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed 
               down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Gourmet magazine has rejected your 
                         recipe for braised kidneys...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL - DAY

               Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his 
               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations 
               with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the 
               floor.

                                     CHILTON
                         Perhaps you should have been less 
                         specific about what kind.
                              (to Barney)
                         Stand him by the toilet. Then leave 
                         us.

               Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies 
               go. Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.

                                     CHILTON
                         Such a lot of correspondence! I can 
                         hardly wait to analyze it in more 
                         detail... But first things first.

               Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the 
               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from 
               underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. 
               Lecter.

                                     CHILTON
                         I thought she might be looking for a 
                         civil rights violation in Migg's 
                         death, so I bugged you... Not a word 
                         to me in all these years, Hannibal. 
                         Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff 
                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. 
                         It's too pathetic.

               SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the 
               front of Dr. Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         You still think you're going to walk 
                         on some beach, and see the birdies? 
                         I don't think so, Hannibal... I called 
                         Senator Ruth Martin, and she never 
                         heard of any deal with you. She never 
                         heard of Clarice Starling, either. 
                         They scammed you, Hannibal...

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.

                                     CHILTON
                         When Crawford gets through milking 
                         you, he's giving you to Baltimore 
                         Homicide for the Raspail murder. And 
                         they're preparing some special 
                         surprises for you right now, in my 
                         electroshock room.

               DR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS)

               first looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to 
               his soft, white, inviting throat...

                                     CHILTON
                         The Starling bitch wants you to rot 
                         here, in this little box, till your 
                         teeth fall out and you're soiling 
                         diapers. You've seen the old ones, 
                         Hannibal. They weep when their stewed 
                         peaches get cold. That'll be you, 
                         too. Unless - you trade with me.

               FAVORING CHILTON

               as he sits chummily on the table.

                                     CHILTON
                         There never was a deal with Senator 
                         Martin - but there is now. I've been 
                         on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on 
                         your behalf. Here's what you get: if 
                         you identify Buffalo Bill, and the 
                         girl is found in time, Senator Martin 
                         will have you transferred to Brushy 
                         Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...

               CLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES

               as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly 
               lock onto something. They widen with interest.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         The Governor has already agreed. You 
                         get books, a view of the woods, and 
                         plenty of exercise time...

               DR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under 
               the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         And best of all, you'd be out of 
                         Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The 
                         Senator will verify these terms on 
                         the phone, and guarantee them in 
                         writing...

               BACK ON DR. LECTER

               as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his 
               eyes towards Chilton. We can almost hear his brain clicking.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         In exchange, I get your full 
                         cooperation in publishing a 
                         professional account of this - my 
                         successful interviews with you. You 
                         publish nothing. And I get exclusive 
                         access to any material from Catherine 
                         Martin... So. Do you accept my 
                         demands?
                              (pause)
                         Answer me, Hannibal.

               A beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INTO 
               SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated.

                                     CHILTON
                         You'll answer me now, or by God, 
                         you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. 
                         Who is Buffalo Bill?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (pause; then softly)
                         I'll tell the Senator herself. But 
                         only in Tennessee...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNS HOPKINS - GENDER IDENTITY CLINIC - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a 
               folder, strides down a hall beside DR. DANIELSON - early 
               50's, severe, in a lab coat. Nurses, doctors, glance as they 
               pass.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I'm not having a witch hunt here, 
                         Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, 
                         non-violent people with a real 
                         problem.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Dr. Danielson, the man we want was 
                         never your patient. It would be 
                         someone you refused because he tries 
                         to conceal a record of criminal 
                         violence. Please, Doctor - time is 
                         eating us up. Just show me the ones 
                         you've turned away.

               Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, 
               with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (adamantly)
                         Examination and interview materials 
                         are confidential. We've never violated 
                         an applicant's trust, and we never 
                         will.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You want to see a violation? This is 
                         a violation...

               He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it 
               down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it 
               clearly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, 
                         she was just ID'd. I met her on a 
                         slab in West Virginia. And sometime 
                         tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's 
                         going to do the same thing to 
                         Catherine Martin.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         That's a childish, bullying stunt, 
                         Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield 
                         surgeon, so you can put away your 
                         picture.

               Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford.

                                     BURROUGHS
                         Phone, Jack. Director Burke.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (snaps)
                         In a minute!

               Burroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Look... search your own records, if 
                         you prefer. You can do it a lot faster 
                         than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo 
                         Bill through your information, I'll 
                         suppress it. Nobody has to know this 
                         hospital cooperated.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I doubt very much that the FBI or 
                         any other government agency can keep 
                         a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will 
                         out... And then what? Will you give 
                         Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a 
                         big pair of sunglasses on this 
                         building, and a funny nose?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. 
                         Very humorous. You like the truth? 
                         Try this.
                              (right in his face, 
                              enraged)
                         He kidnaps young women and kills 
                         them and rips their skin off. We 
                         don't want him to do that anymore. 
                         If you don't help me, just as fast 
                         as you can, then the Justice 
                         Department is going to ask publicly 
                         for a court order, We'll ask twice a 
                         day, just in time for the morning 
                         and evening news. And each one of 
                         our press conferences will focus on 
                         Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, 
                         and how we're still hoping for his 
                         cooperation. And every time there's 
                         any news on the case - when Catherine 
                         Martin floats, when the next one 
                         floats, and the next one - why, we'll 
                         just issue another press release 
                         about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over 
                         at Johns Hopkins - complete with all 
                         his humorous fucking remarks.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (pause; stiffly)
                         It may be that - I could confer with 
                         my colleagues on this. And get back 
                         to you.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Would you, Doctor? That would be so 
                         kind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Crawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches 
               silently.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone; stunned)
                         Transferred...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               HAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. 
               Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by 
               flags.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         Already airborne for Memphis. Senator 
                         Martin's meeting him at the airport.
                              (uneasily)
                         Jack - did you make some sort of 
                         promise to Lecter, in the Senator's 
                         name?

               Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his 
               desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, 
               very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         We're going to have to talk about 
                         this, Jack. The Senator's mad as 
                         hell. Paul Krendler's over here from 
                         Justice, she's asking him to take 
                         charge in Memphis... I know that... 
                         But you're still in command of the 
                         task force, and Lecter's plane can 
                         still be ordered back. It's your 
                         call, Jack - but I want it now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills 
               him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (into phone)
                         Let him land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY

               Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just 
               slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's 
               furious.

                                     CLARICE
                         Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? 
                         That slimy little bastard! We were 
                         so close with Lecter - and now her 
                         last chance is gone.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Let's get some coffee and talk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a 
               sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails 
               them slowly, radios CRACKLING.

                                     CLARICE
                         Are you in trouble over this, Mr. 
                         Crawford? Can Senator Martin do 
                         something to you?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy 
                         Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have 
                         to retire in two years. It's not a 
                         consideration. But you are...
                              (beat)
                         You've done enough. If I keep you 
                         out of school any longer, you'll be 
                         recycled. Cost you six months, at 
                         least. I can guarantee you readmission 
                         here, but that's about it.
                              (he stops, looks at 
                              her)
                         Now's your chance, Starling. Go back 
                         to class. Leave Bill to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't want me chasing him, 
                         you shouldn't have taken me to that 
                         funeral home.

               He looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on.

                                     CLARICE
                         Lecter is still the key, I know he 
                         is. Whatever he told me about Bill 
                         is just as good now as it was before.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Or just as worthless. But I want you 
                         in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when 
                         he gets tired of toying with Senator 
                         Martin, he'll talk to you again. 
                         There's a plane waiting for you now 
                         at the airstrip.

               She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's 
               quit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I lied to Lecter. I'll need some 
                         kind of peace offering... Can I get 
                         the drawings from his cell?

                         Good idea. Meantime, try to get a 
                         feel for Catherine Martin. Her 
                         apartment, her friends... how he 
                         might've stalked her. I'm going to 
                         the other two clinics, Minnesota and 
                         Ohio.
                              (he crumples his cup, 
                              tosses it)
                         Now's the hardest part, Starling. 
                         Use your anger, don't let it keep 
                         you from thinking. Just keep your 
                         eyes on Catherine. We've got less 
                         than 30 hours.

                                     CLARICE
                              (hesitates)
                         Mr. Crawford... can those cops down 
                         there handle Dr. Lecter?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (grimly)
                         They'll use their best men. But they 
                         better be paying attention...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AIR NATIONAL GUARD HANGER - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - DAY

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter. Behind his mask, the alert, searching 
               eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         He will...

               OFFICERS PEMBRY AND BOYLE

               two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking 
               Dr. Lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.

                                     BOYLE
                         Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm 
                         Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry. 
                         We aim to treat you just as nice as 
                         you treat us. Act like a gentlemen, 
                         you'll get three hots and a cot.

                                     PEMBRY
                         But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, 
                         buddy ruff. You get cute, try to 
                         bite somebody? - we'll tie your 
                         asshole in a knot. You savvy?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly 
                         do.

               The officers turn away, Boyle signing a clipboarded form.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. 
                         Won't be no trouble as all if he 
                         don't flip out.

                                     BOYLE
                         Dr. Chilton...?

               NEW ANGLE - WIDER

               as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. Parked to one 
               side: an EMS ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a 
               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. 
               Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances 
               towards the open hanger doorway.

                                     BOYLE
                         If you'll please sign right here, 
                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

               Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold 
               pen; it's gone. He searches other pockets, with growing 
               unhappiness.

                                     BOYLE
                         Use mine.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Here they come.

               TWO BLACK STRETCH LIMOUSINES

               glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. Secret Service agents 
               pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. A driver opens the 
               rear door of the second car, and Krendler steps out, followed 
               by the Senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as 
               last, by the Senator herself. Barely glancing around, she 
               strides towards Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - DR. LECTER AND SEN. MARTIN

               as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his 
               restraints. The others instinctively keep a distance, but 
               Chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes Dr. 
               Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               They stare at one another for a long moment: the Senator 
               tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit 
                         guaranteeing your new rights... You'll 
                         want to read it before I sign.

               He assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I won't waste your time and 
                         Catherine's time bargaining for petty 
                         privileges. Clarice Starling and 
                         that awful Jack Crawford have wasted 
                         far too much already. I only pray 
                         they haven't doomed the poor girl... 
                         Let me help you now, and I'll trust 
                         you when it's all over.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have my word. Paul?

               Krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Buffalo Bill's real name is William 
                         Rubin. I met him just once. He was 
                         referred to me in April or May, 1980, 
                         by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They 
                         were lovers, but Raspail had become 
                         very frightened. Apparently Rubin 
                         had murdered a transient, and - done 
                         things with the skin. He thought if 
                         I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be 
                         safe from the police, and he's be 
                         safe from Billy... Obviously, he was 
                         wrong.

                                     KRENDLER
                         We need his address, a physical descr-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you nurse Catherine?

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (pause; startled)
                         What...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you breast-feed her?

               He flicks his tongue obscenely.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You son-of-a -

               The Senator stills him with a hand. She is trembling.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Yes... I did.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?
                              (a beat; then rapidly, 
                              bored)
                         Six foot one, strongly built, about 
                         190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale 
                         blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said 
                         he lived in Philadelphia, but may 
                         have lied. That's really all I can 
                         remember, Senator - but if I think 
                         of any more, I'll let you know.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (to the others)
                         Let's go with it.

               They start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Senator Martin...! You can't trust 
                         Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. 
                         It's such a game with these people. 
                         They're determined to get the arrest 
                         for themselves. The "collar," I think 
                         they say.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in 
                         mind.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.

               INT. MR. GUMB'S BASEMENT - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLOSE ON scraps of food - peas, chicken bones - lying on the 
               cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a TV dinner.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                              (muttering, feisty)
                         Close enough to fuck is close enough 
                         to fight...

               CATHERINE

               is hunched over in concentration. The plastic toilet bucket 
               is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get my legs round your neck, you 
                         goddamn creep, I'll send you home to 
                         Jesus...

               HER FINGERS

               are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it 
               meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her 
               wrist.

               SHE STANDS

               gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket 
               by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement 
               floor.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Okay, Precious. Time for a treat...

               She hurls the bucket upwards.

               AT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE

               the bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside.

               ANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS

               who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks 
               an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate.

               DOWN IN THE PIT

               Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast.

               THE BUCKET LANDS

               two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops.

               PRECIOUS TROTS UP

               then pauses, staring curiously towards...

               VERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV)

               the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as 
               Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards 
               the pit.

               Precious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious.

               CATHERINE

               staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (softly)
                         Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice 
                         yummy bone... c'mon, you little 
                         shit...

               PRECIOUS

               edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing 
               the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but 
               Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like 
               a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop.

               CATHERINE

               stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hang on, boy... hang on...

               PRECIOUS

               still fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks 
               precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... 
               until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily 
               into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over 
               the edge.

               CATHERINE

               crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Nooooo...!

               THE LITTLE DOG

               furious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust.

               CLOSE ON CATHERINE

               as she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil 
               tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held 
               in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on 
               the glass.

               Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at -

               A young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He 
               smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. 
               He also wears gloves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around.

               A big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the 
               breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new 
               red phones are hooked up as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks 
               inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ATTIC CRAWL-SPACE

               A ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds. Clarice, 
               lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               Flat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's 
               bed. She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               CLOSE ON an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a 
               bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry.

               Clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure 
               suddenly looms INTO SHOT, giving her a bad start; she cries 
               out softly.

               Senator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Who are you, please? I thought the 
                         police were through in here.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (softly, very angry)
                         Clarice Starling...
                              (calls out)
                         Paul? Would you come in here, 
                         please...?

               Krendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy 
                         Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul, 
                         this is the trainee that Jack Crawford 
                         sent to Lecter... She lied to him, 
                         pretending to have my authority, and 
                         thus jeopardized this entire 
                         investigation. Now she has the further 
                         gall to invade my daughter's privacy, 
                         again without permission. If her 
                         little games have killed my baby...

               Overcome, she hurries from the room. Krendler shuts the door 
               behind her, points sternly at Clarice.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You're out of line, Starling, and 
                         you're off this case. Back to 
                         Quantico.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Your instructions are what I'm giving 
                         you now. Jack Crawford answers to 
                         the Director, and the Director answers 
                         to me. My God, Crawford's losing 
                         it...! He shouldn't even be on this, 
                         with his wife sick as she is... How 
                         the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
                         He gave you - what? Some kind of 
                         special ID? Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (stubbornly)
                         I need the ID to fly with my gun. 
                         The gun belongs in Quantico.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon 
                         as you get back. The gun, too. Be on 
                         the next plane, Starling, there's 
                         one in 90 minutes.

               Clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts 
                         me. Or at least, he used to. If I 
                         could just -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Lecter has already named Buffalo 
                         Bill.

               Clarice reacts, surprised. Krendler takes a folded computer 
               sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. She takes it, reads.

                                     KRENDLER
                         He gave us a perfectly good 
                         description, and we're on it now, so 
                         we won't be needing your little 
                         novelty act any longer - or his, 
                         either. He's under close guard at 
                         the courthouse, pending a prison 
                         transfer. The next plane, Officer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" 
                         strike you as - I don't know - kind 
                         of vague?

               Krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Do you need a police escort, Starling? 
                         Or do you think you can find the 
                         airport by yourself?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHELBY COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an 
               armada of police cruisers parked at the curb.

               Clarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door angrily. 
               Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawings - 
               she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion 
               makes her pause.

               Dr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, 
               is preening grandly. 

               Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and 
               inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

               SGT. TATE, a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's ID. He 
               looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?

                                     CLARICE
                         I just left him.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Access to Lecter is strictly limited. 
                         We've been getting death threats.
                              (hesitates again)
                         Log in, and check your weapon.

               He picks up a phone, murmurs into it. As he does so, Clarice 
               glances around this main ground floor lobby.

               HER POV

               The building looks like an armed fort. Cops with shotguns 
               guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the 
               stairs, the single elevator. More of them are coming and 
               going.

                                     MURRAY (V.O.)
                         Shoot, we haven't had this kinda 
                         security since the President came 
                         through town...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING

               Clarice and OFFICER MURRAY, a young patrolman, ride up in an 
               old-fashioned, CREAKING, metal-cage elevator. He is excited.

                                     MURRAY
                         Every cop in Tennessee wants a look 
                         at this guy. 'Sit true what they're 
                         sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         I don't have a name for what he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - 5TH FLOOR

               Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the 
               unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings.

                                     PEMBRY
                         You know the rules, ma'am?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned 
                         him before.

               He waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now.

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. A 
               massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer 
               Boyle sits facing its barred door. He rises, nods, moving 
               away to allow her privacy.

               INSIDE THE CAGE

               a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a 
               flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. Dr. Lecter sits at the 
               table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file. 
               He now wears a green prison jumpsuit. A small cassette player 
               is chained to the steel table.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (without turning)
                         Good afternoon, Clarice.

               She stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.

                                     CLARICE
                         I thought you might want your drawings 
                         back... Just until you get your view.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford
                         send you here for one last wheedle - 
                         before you're both booted off the 
                         case?

                                     CLARICE
                         Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

               He spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         People will say we're in love.
                              (beat)
                         Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? 
                         Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...

               He spins again in his chair, playfully.

               MOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE

               as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. 
                         You couldn't have talked with this 
                         "William Rubin", even once, and come 
                         out knowing so little about him... 
                         You made him up, didn't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clarice... you're hardly in a position 
                         to accuse me of lying.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think you were telling me the truth 
                         in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell 
                         me the rest now.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've studied the case file, have 
                         you...? Everything you need to find 
                         him is right in these pages. Whatever 
                         his name is.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then tell me how.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. 
                         Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each 
                         particular thing, ask: What is it, 
                         in itself, what is its nature...? 
                         What does he do, this man you seek?

                         No! That's incidental.

               CLOSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT as he rises, pained by her ignorance, 
               and crosses to the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What is the first and principal thing

                         killing?

                         No, he covets. That's his nature. 
                         And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? 
                         Do we seek out things to covet? Make 
                         an effort to answer.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. We just -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. Precisely. We begin by coveting 
                         what we see every day. Don't you 
                         feel eyes moving over your body, 
                         Clarice? I hardly see how you 
                         couldn't. And don't your eyes move 
                         over the things you want?

                                     CLARICE
                         All right, then tell me how -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. It's your turn to tell me, 
                         Clarice. You don't have any more 
                         vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. 
                         Why did you run away from that ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         We don't reckon time the same way, 
                         Clarice. This is all the time you'll 
                         ever have.

                                     CLARICE
                         Later, listen, I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'll listen now. After your father's 
                         murder, you were orphaned. You were 
                         ten years old. You went to live with 
                         cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch 
                         in Montana. And - ?

                                     CLARICE
                         And - one morning I just - ran away...

               She turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not "just," Clarice. What set you 
                         off? You started what time?

                                     CLARICE
                         Early. Still dark.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Then something woke you. What? Did 
                         you dream...? What was it?

               IN FLASHBACK

               The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, 
               frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn. 
               Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, 
               partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I heard a strange sound...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What was it?

               THE CHILD RISES

               crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't know. I went to look...

               HIGH ANGLES (2ND STORY) - THE CHILD'S POV

               Shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby 
               barn, carrying mysterious bundles. The mens' breath is 
               steaming... A refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine 
               adding more steam. A strange, almost surrealistic scene...

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Screaming! Some kind of - screaming. 
                         Like a child's voice...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               is terrified; she covers her ears.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What did you do?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Got dressed without turning on the 
                         light. I went downstairs... outside...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn 
               door. She ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who 
               passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. He goes 
               into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I crept up to the barn... I was so 
                         scared to look inside - but I had 
                         to...

               THE LITTLE GIRL'S POV

               as the open doorway LOOMS CLOSER... Bright lights inside, 
               straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         And what did you see, Clarice?

               A SQUIRMING LAMB

               is held down on a table by two ranch hands.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Lambs. The lambs were screaming...

               A third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody 
               knife. Just as he's about to slice its throat -

               BACK TO THE ADULT CLARICE

               staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the 
               child's shock. We see Dr. Lecter, over her shoulder, studying 
               her intently.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         They were slaughtering the spring 
                         lambs?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...! They were screaming.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         So you ran away...

                                     CLARICE
                         No. First I tried to free them... I 
                         opened the gate of their pen - but 
                         they wouldn't run. They just stood 
                         there, confused. They wouldn't run...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         But you could. You did.

                                     CLARICE
                         I took one lamb. And I ran away, as 
                         fast as I could...

               IN FLASHBACK

               a vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the 
               little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Where were you going?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I don't know. I had no food or water. 
                         It was very cold. I thought - if I 
                         can even save just one... but he got 
                         so heavy. So heavy...

               The tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the 
               ground, hunched over in dispair.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't get more than a few miles 
                         before the sheriff's car found me. 
                         The rancher was so angry he sent me 
                         to live at the Lutheran orphanage in 
                         Bozeman. I never saw the ranch 
                         again...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         But what became of your lamb?
                              (no response)
                         Clarice...?

               BACK TO SCENE

               as the adult Clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. 
               She shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You still wake up sometimes, don't 
                         you? Wake up in the dark, with the 
                         lambs screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you think if you saved Catherine, 
                         you could make them stop...? Do you 
                         think, if Catherine lives, you won't 
                         wake up in the dark, ever again, to 
                         the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (a pause; then, oddly 
                              at peace)
                         Thank you, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a whisper)
                         Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Dr. Chilton... I believe you know 
                         each other?

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice turns, startled, and the fuming Chilton seizes 
               her elbow. Pembry and Boyle are beside him, looking grim.

                                     CHILTON
                         Out. Let's go.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to 
                         have you put on a place.

               Clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Brave Clarice. Will you let me know 
                         if ever the lambs stop screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                              (moving closer to the 
                              bars)
                         Yes. I'll tell you.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Promise...?
                              (she nods. He smiles)
                         Then why not take your case file? I 
                         won't be needing it anymore.

               He holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. She 
               hesitates, then reaches to take it.

               VERY CLOSE ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

               as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, 
               and lingers there, just for a moment.

               DR. LECTER'S EYES

               widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good-bye, Clarice.

               CLARICE

               hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her, pushing her away.

               HER POV - MOVING

               as Dr. Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GARMENT SWEATSHOP - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - MR. GUMB'S POV as he pushes a rolling rack of 
               completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as 
               aisle. SOUND of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, 
               as he passes row on row of work tables. The seamstresses, 
               mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly 
               avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some 
               nameless way.

               A thin FOREMAN in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching. He 
               rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack 
               rolls to a stop.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And 
                         what have you brought us today?

               He seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic 
               wrapper. He examines it, stroking the sleeve.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Oh, marvelous... You know, I always 
                         say you're the Leonardo of leather.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (a harsh whisper)
                         Oil.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Pardon...?

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You're leaving oil on the skin.

               The foreman quickly releases the jacket.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Of course... You'll be wanting your -

               Mr. Gumb's hand reaches INTO SHOT, snatching an envelope 
               from him. The foreman is watching him walk away, as a 
               seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments. The 
               foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off. He strokes 
               the jacket again, admiringly.

                                     FOREMAN
                              (to seamstress)
                         I wish we had a dozen like him...

               Clarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly 
               towards a departure ramp. Through a huge plate glass window, 
               we can see her plane. She glances back over her shoulder at

               A pair of UNIFORMED COPS brawny and impassive, their arms 
               folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight.

               Clarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway. The 
               BACH CONTINUES, as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHELBY CO. COURTHOUSE - HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM -

               NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried 
               by Pembry, as he approaches Dr. Lecter's cell.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (shouts)
                         Ready when you are, Doc!

               IN THE CELL

               the BACH is issuing from the cassette player. Beside it, on 
               the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is 
               an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice. 
               Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind 
               the paper screen. He calls out from there.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Just another minute, please!

               Pembry grunts, sets the tray down. Boyle joins him, handing 
               him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens 
               to belt clips. Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring 
               of keys.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for 
                         dinner, extra rare.

                                     BOYLE
                              (laughs)
                         What you reckon he'll want for 
                         breakfast - some fuckin' thing from 
                         the zoo?

               INSIDE THE SCREEN

               Dr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying 
               slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in 
               his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of 
               metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled 
               pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar 
               at one end, a square edge at the other.

               DR. LECTER

               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then 
               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He pushes 
               down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment he 
               smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, 
               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL

               Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet FLUSHES, and Dr. Lecter 
               reappears, looking jaunty.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same 
                         drill as lunchtime.

               Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles 
               backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists 
               through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his 
               hands.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm ready when you are, Officer 
                         Pembry.

               Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. He 
               tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his 
               wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods 
               to Boyle.

               NEW ANGLE - AT CELL DOOR

               as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around. 
               Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and 
               pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray.

               DR. LECTER

               watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from 
               him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear 
               off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift 
               key, held between the tips of his right index and middle 
               fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds 
               it.

               NEW ANGLE - FAVORING BOYLE

               as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards 
               Dr. Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray.

               BOYLE'S RIGHT HAND

               is just inches from the tray when Dr. Lecter's hand darts 
               INTO SHOT, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.

               BOYLE

               looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning 
               face of Dr. Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and 
               snaps -

               THE OTHER CUFF

               around the bolted leg of the table. And suddenly all natural 
               SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much 
               louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and 
               we see...

               VARIOUS ANGLES - EACH BLURRING INTO STOP-ACTION

               Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... 

               Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into 
               Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door 
               frame...

               Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his 
               pants pocket for his handcuff key...

               Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he 
               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... 

               Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at...

               Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...

               Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it 
               like a dog shakes a rat...

               Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...

               Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed 
               Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing 
               him to his knees...

               Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, 
               unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, 
               seeing...

               Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised 
               high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and 
               again...

               Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -

               CLOSE ANGLE ON

               the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now 
               flecked with blood. In addition to the Bach, we now hear 
               soft PANTING, close by, and whimpering SOBS in the background.

               ANGLE ON DR. LECTER

               eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His 
               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing 
               slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks 
               down.

               HIS POV

               By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled 
               from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.

               DR. LECTER

               picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a four-
               inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off screen, 
               turns.

               LOW ANGLE ON PEMBRY

               as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command 
               desk, and the phone. He is crying, but frantically determined.

               PEMBRY'S POV - PARTIALLY BLURRED, THEN CLEARING

               Above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and Boyle's 
               holstered revolvers...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then 
               indicates a stop there, at the top floor.

               FAVORING SGT. TATE

               at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. Another 
               cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a 
               magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in 
               the lobby.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         What is this shit...? Did somebody 
                         go up to five?
                              (Jacobs shakes his 
                              head)
                         Call Pembry, ask him what -

               A GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, 
               echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt. Tate jumps to his feet, 
               grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and 
               noisy.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         CP, shots fired on five! Repeat, 
                         shots fires on five! Outside posts 
                         look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly 
                         shit.

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4...

               BACK ON SGT. TATE

               as he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full 
               uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (to the others)
                         SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up 
                         on your outside posts. Bobby, get 
                         the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover 
                         that fucking elevator if it comes 
                         all the way to -

                                     A COP (O.S.)
                         It stopped!

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone 
               again.

                                     SGT. TATE

                         Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me 
                         the SWAT team and an ambulance, double 
                         quick. We're going up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in 
               bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but 
               carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with 
               drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a 
               ghostly echo in here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               A thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator 
               door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer.

               SGT. TATE

               approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind 
               him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the 
               various office doors - all locked - as they creep up.

               MOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER

               as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins 
               to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (shouts at ceiling)
                         Pembry? Boyle...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               ANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on 
               the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD.

               After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for 
               the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving 
               low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. 
               They all freeze, staring in utter horror.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Oh no... no...

               THEIR POV

               is a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one 
               sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the 
               cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. 
               The faces are unrecognizable.

               SGT. TATE

               struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around 
               him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)

                              throat)
                         Two officers down. Prisoner is 
                         missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... 
                         He's stripped the bed, might be making 
                         a rope, check all windows. Where the 
                         fuck is my ambulance?

               IN THE CELL

               a cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his 
               fingers on Boyle's neck.

                                     JACOBS
                         Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's 
                         gone...

               AT THE OTHER BODY

               a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, 
               the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the 
               gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, 
               very softly.

                                     MURRAY
                         This one's alive!

               Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Take ahold of him where he can feel 
                         your hands, son. Talk to him.

                                     MURRAY
                         What's his name, Sarge?

                                     SGT. TATE
                         It's Pembry, now talk to him, God 
                         dammit.
                              (into radio, looking 
                              around)
                         Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. 
                         Lecter is missing and armed - he 
                         took Boyle's gun...

               The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds 
               up one finger to Tate.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into radio)
                         Pembry got off one round - there's a 
                         chance Lecter was hit. We heard a 
                         total of three shots fired, so he's 
                         got four left... He's got a knife, 
                         too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

               VARIOUS ANGLES on a floodlit scene of barely controlled 
               pandemonium. Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, 
               SIRENS in the distance. SWAT members, in full gear, leap 
               from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... EMS 
               orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... Cops kneel 
               for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the 
               windows...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT

               A trio of EMS orderlies work fast over the body, already 
               strapped on its gurney. They bandage a big plastic airway 
               into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at 
               the neck. Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody 
               fist.

                                     MURRAY
                         You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' 
                         good, buddy, you're gonna make it...

               One orderly massages the heart. Another is popping a plasma 
               bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts 
               convulsing.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Downstairs - let's go!

               Quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, 
               with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, SWAT 
               men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the 
               ready...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE ELEVATOR - DESCENDING - NIGHT

               Sgt. Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the 
                         elevator, bringing it down. Pembry 
                         and Boyle are both cleared, top three 
                         floors secured, main stairwell 
                         secured. He's somewhere on -

               A spot of blood falls on his cheek. He and Jacobs stare at 
               each other. Another spot hits his shoulder. They look up.

               THEIR POV

               Blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch.

               Sgt. Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere 
                         on two, sir... That's all for now, 
                         over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, 
               stepping quickly to the side. Tate reaches back in and -

               CLOSE ANGLE

               Locks the elevator into position, with its doors open.

               OTHER COPS are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate 
               frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (whispers)
                         He's on the roof of the elevator!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Two SWAT officers, PETERSON and KUBELL, turn a key, unlocking 
               and opening this floor's elevator doorway. The shaft is dark. 
               Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a 
               mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft.

               IN THE MIRROR (DISTORTED BY THE ANGLE)

               Is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on 
               his stomach, atop the elevator. A shiny revolver is near one 
               hand.

               PETERSON

               whispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault 
               rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge.

                                     PETERSON
                         I see him... There's a weapon by his 
                         hand. He's not moving...

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Can you get the drop?

                                     PETERSON
                         We got the drop.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         One warning. Then take him out.

               Peterson nods to Kubell, who switches ON the flashlight, as 
               Peterson shouts down the shaft.

                                     PETERSON
                         Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

               IN THE MIRROR

               the green figure shows no movement.

               ANGLE ON THE COPS AGAIN

               as Peterson mutters to Kubell.

                                     PETERSON
                         Put one in his leg.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               The figure below, as Kubell's gunshot ROARS, echoing hugely 
               in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. 
               The figure doesn't stir.

               PETERSON

               staring down the shaft, raises his mike again.

                                     PETERSON
                         No movement.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Okay, Johnny, hold your fire...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               A small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, 
               from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER.

                                     SWAT COMMANDER
                              (into radio mike)
                         We're coming into the car, we're 
                         opening the hatch. Watch his hands. 
                         Any fire will come from us. Affirm?

                                     PETERSON'S VOICE
                         Got it.

               The SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks 
               at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body 
               armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the 
               corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets 
               a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big 
               Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch.

               CLOSE ON

               ...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a 
               body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught 
               at the waist. We see the back of the head.

               SGT. TATE

               shoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns 
               towards the SWAT commander, astonished.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         That's Pembry!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMS AMBULANCE - MOVING

               In the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against 
               the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his 
               patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND 
               of the siren.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (into radio mike)
                         He's comatose, but his vital signs 
                         are good. Pressure's 130 over 90... 
                         Yeah, 90! Pulse 85...

               Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure 
               sits slowly upright...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         His convulsions have stopped, but 
                         he's got so much loose skin on his 
                         face, it's hard to tell if -

               Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He 
               turns, puzzled...

               THE POCKETKNIFE BLADE

               in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS)

               MOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, 
               its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make 
               way for it.

               Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, 
               before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. 
               Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the 
               wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then 
               the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts 
               rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing 
               speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - 
               and we LINGER on...

               BIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN

               ...that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles."

               CLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

               Dr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it 
               with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, 
               over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at 
               last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in 
               despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from 
               us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last 
               to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is 
               standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards 
               the sheriff...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN

               CRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards 
               the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to 
               the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb.

               The dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly 
               takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - 
               stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open 
               barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, 
               a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His 
               knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, 
               his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. 
               Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's 
               face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the 
               dangling receiver...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHOWER STALL - FBI DORM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a shower head, as water suddenly blasts out. Clarice 
               moves INTO SHOT, as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively, 
               almost desperately, unable to get clean...

                                     ARDELIA (V.O.)
                         They found the ambulance...

               INT. CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

               Clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet. 
               The Buffalo Bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her 
               feet. Ardelia hovers anxiously nearby.

                                     ARDELIA
                         In the parking garage at Memphis 
                         airport. The crew was dead. He killed 
                         a tourist, too. Got his clothes, 
                         cash... By now he could be anywhere.

               Clarice looks up. Her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, 
               and something close to despair. She reads Ardelia's thought.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He won't come after me.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                              (bitterly)
                         It would be rude. And he wouldn't 
                         get to ask any more questions...

               Ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Clarice - you did the best anybody 
                         could have for Catherine Martin. You 
                         stuck your neck out for her and you 
                         got your butt kicked for her and you 
                         tried. It's not your fault it ended 
                         this way.

                                     CLARICE
                         The worst part - the thing that's 
                         making me crazy - is that Bill is 
                         right in front of me. Only I can't 
                         see him...
                              (touching the case 
                              file)
                         Lecter said, everything I need to 
                         catch him is right here, in these 
                         pages...

                                     ARDELIA
                         Lecter said a lot of things.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shakes her head)
                         He's here, Ardelia.

               Ardelia stares back at her.

               SOUND UPCUT - the low throb of a washing machine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - ACADEMY DORM - NIGHT (VERY LATE)

               Clarice has spread out the case file across two washing 
               machines. Ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another 
               pile of forms. Nearby is their laundry basket, detergent 
               box.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (surprised)
                         Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting? 
                         She holds up the map, with its 
                         location markings for the kidnapping 
                         and body dump sites. Clarice takes 
                         it, looks.

               INSERT - THE MAP

               with newly inked words in Dr. Lecter's precise, elegant hand.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Clarice, doesn't this random 
                         scattering of sites seem overdone to 
                         you? Doesn't it seem desperately 
                         random - like the elaborations of a 
                         bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks up at Ardelia, puzzled but excited.

                                     CLARICE
                         "Desperately random." What does he 
                         mean?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Not random at all, maybe. Like there's 
                         some pattern here...?

                                     CLARICE
                         But there is no pattern. There's no 
                         connection at all among these places, 
                         or the computers would've nailed it! 
                         They're even found in random order.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Well, except for the one girl.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         What girl?

                                     ARDELIA
                         The one that was weighted down. Where 
                         is she...? Fred something.

               They search among the inserts. Clarice finds the graduation 
               photo.

                                     CLARICE
                         Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, 
                         Ohio. The first girl taken, but the 
                         third body found... Why?

                                     ARDELIA
                         'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted 
                         her down.

                                     CLARICE
                         But why? He didn't weight the others.

               Clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.

                                     CLARICE
                         The first, what the hell did Lecter 
                         say about... "First principles," he 
                         said. Simplicity... What does this 
                         guy do, he "covets." How do we first 
                         start to covet? "We covet what we 
                         see -"

               She stops, turns. She grabs the photo of Fredrica from 
               Ardelia, stares at it. She looks up, trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         "- every day."

                                     ARDELIA
                              (softly)
                         Hot damn, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         He knew her...!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford are seated in front of Director Burke, 
               who's at his desk. Another chair is empty, because Krendler 
               is pacing. All four are nearing their boiling points.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe he lives in this, this 
                         Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw 
                         her every day, and killed her sort 
                         of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant 
                         to... give her a 7-Up and talk about 
                         the choir. But then -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Starling -

                                     CLARICE
                         But then he had to cover up, make 
                         her seem just like all the rest of 
                         them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

                                     KRENDLER
                         The market in Lecter hints is way 
                         down, today, okay? I've got two good 
                         men dead in Memphis, and three
                         civilians. I've got -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Who the hell's fault is -

                                     KRENDLER
                         - a U.S. Senator who's half out of 
                         her head because her daughter's going 
                         to be murdered today! And all because 
                         of your mind games with fucking 
                         Lecter!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If you hadn't interfered, he'd still 
                         be in custody in Baltimore!

                                     BURKE
                         Jack -

                                     KRENDLER
                         You sent in a green recruit, with a
                         phony goddamn offer -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're just trying to cover your ass 
                         for letting him escape!

                                     BURKE
                         THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...

               A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. 
               Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally 
               retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice.

                                     BURKE
                              (very reluctantly)
                         Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. 
                         You're suspended from the Academy.
                              (Crawford starts to 
                              interrupt)
                         Not another word!
                              (to Clarice)
                         This is pending a reevaluation of 
                         your fitness for the service. I 
                         promise you'll get a fair hearing.
                              (pause)
                         Jack... you're ordered to take 
                         compassionate leave. You'll spend 
                         the rest of the day briefing the 
                         AG's office, then transfer command 
                         of the task force, effective by 1800 
                         hours.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take 
                         care of Bella.

               Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and 
               very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, 
               not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other.

                                     CLARICE
                         All his victims are women... His 
                         obsession is women, he lives to hunt 
                         women. But not one women is hunting 
                         him - except me. I can walk in a 
                         woman's room and know three times as 
                         much about her as a man would.
                              (beat)
                         I have to go to Belvedere.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You heard them. I don't have that 
                         authority anymore.

                                     CLARICE
                         You do until six p.m.

               He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, 
               defeated, old beyond his years.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, 
                         ten months ago. Our people worked 
                         it, so did the locals.

                                     CLARICE
                         But not from this angle. Not thinking 
                         he knew her. You've got to send me!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I 
                         won't disobey orders, not even now.

                                     CLARICE
                         But I just became a private citizen. 
                         I can go anywhere I want to.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         With ID and a gun...? Impersonating 
                         a federal agent is a felony.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. 
                         This morning, or maybe at noon, but 
                         today, and Belvedere's our last 
                         chance. I'm flying there, right now, 
                         unless you stop me. You want my ID? 
                         Here - take it...

               He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's 
               passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pulls out his wallet)
                         There's about $300 here... And a 
                         hotline code number. They'll patch 
                         you through to me, wherever I am.

               She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or 
               his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, 
               smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.

               SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, 
               as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, 
               as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in 
               background.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (calling out)
                         Preeeeecious...!

               CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through 
               the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The 
               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult 
               moths flutter out.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Precious, come on Precious! Busy 
                         busy day today...

               CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently 
               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!

               CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch 
               barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a 
               practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note 
               of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You come here this minute, you little 
                         scamp!

               LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through 
               his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking 
               anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. 
               Genuinely scared.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious...?

               LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING

               Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the 
               oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Sweetheart...?

               From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         She'd down here you sack of shit.

               Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the 
               doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with 
               a series of YIPS.

               UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM

               as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious, are you all right?

               REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE

               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing 
               Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me a telephone. Lower it down to 
                         me. Do it now, mister! I don't want 
                         to have to hurt this little dog.

               UPWARD ANGLE

               on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from 
               inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim.

               Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming 
               at him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You shoot motherfucker you better 
                         kill me quick or I'll break her 
                         fucking neck, I swear to God!

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (wails)
                         Nooooooo!

               Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting 
               the head. The dog WHINES piteously.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Back off, you son of a bitch! Back 
                         off!

               UPWARD ANGLE

               as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream 
               of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               On Catherine, as she maintains her grip.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's better... Now get me a live 
                         telephone. Get a long extension and 
                         lower is down here... And you better 
                         do it fast, too, 'cause I think her 
                         leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, 
                         she needs a vet.

               MR. GUMB

               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         You think she's in pain? You don't 
                         know what pain is. But you're going 
                         to find out...

               And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing 
               off.

               CATHERINE

               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She 
               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in 
               its fur, sobbing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BELVEDERE, OHIO - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops. 
               After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly. Double-
               checking this address, she glances up from a folded street 
               map to -

               AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE

               in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow 
               river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along 
               this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from 
               there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

               An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish 
               water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, 
               gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a 
               new coop.

               CLARICE

               approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red-
               rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Bimmel...? 

               He stares back at her, warily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIMMEL HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN as Mr. Bimmel leads Clarice up a 
               steep flight of steps. The bannister is worn, sags a bit.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         I don't know nothin' new to tell ya. 
                         The police been back here so many 
                         times already... Fredrica went into 
                         Columbus on the bus to see about a 
                         job. She left the interview OK. She 
                         never come home.

               Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: 
               the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show 
               Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful 
               at each age.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         Her room's how she left it. Just 
                         shut the door when you're done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FREDRICA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING SLOWLY as she takes in flowery chintz 
               curtains... posters of Madonna and Blondie... a twin bed, 
               with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow... a big sewing 
               machine in the corner.

               CLARICE

               turns, absorbing nuances. There is loneliness here, an echo 
               of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling. A shrill 
               MEOW, and she looks down...

               BIG TORTOISESHELL CAT

               is rubbing against her ankles.

               CLARICE

               picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears. She glances up.

               IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR

               she and the cat stares back at their own reflection...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school 
               yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs 
               and singles. The cat has wandered off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               pulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised 
               and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from 
               the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing 
               supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging 
               clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer 
               look.

               THE DRESS

               is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of 
               the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a 
               blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back.

               FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE

               as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on 
               the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She 
               takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool 
               metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. 
                         But there's the problem of his size, 
                         you see...

               She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she 
               straightens, her attention riveted by something...

               CLARICE'S POV

               On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined 
               dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there 
               shapes, before jumping back to -

               CLARICE

               who stares at them, starting to tremble.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Even if he were a woman, he'd have 
                         to be a big one...

               IN FLASHBACK

               those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in 
               the funeral home in West Virginia...

               CLOSE ON CLARICE

               as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sewing darts. You bastard.

               Clarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn 
               furniture.

                              (into phone)
                         He's making himself a "woman suit," 
                         Mr. Crawford - out of real women! 
                         And he can sew, this guy, he's really
                         skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -

                         That's why they're all so big - 
                         because he needs a lot of skin! He 
                         keeps them alive to starve them awhile - 
                         to loosen their skin, so that -

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Starling, we know who he is! And 
                         where he is. We're on our way now.

                              (pause; surprised)
                         Where?

               INT. FBI TURBOJET - FLYING - DAY

               Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, 
               in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin 
               is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. 
               Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing.

                         Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll 
                         be on the ground in 45 minutes with 
                         the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in 
                         charge, Starling. He's mine.

               INTERCUTTING

               as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with 
               disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Sir, that's great news. But how -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Johns Hopkins finally came up with a 
                         name for us. We fed him into Known 
                         Offenders, and he came up cherries.

                              Burroughs)
                         Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA 
                         "John Grant." Lecter's description 
                         was accurate, he just lied about the 
                         name.

               INSIDE THE JET - MOVING ANGLE

               from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the 
               twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, 
               quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - 
               silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades...

                         This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered 
                         both his grandparents when he was 
                         twelve, and did nine years in juvenile

                         Take a bow. Customs had some paper 
                         on his alias. They stopped a carton 
                         two years ago at LAX - live 
                         caterpillars from Surinam. The 
                         addressee was "John Grant." Calumet 
                         Power & Light's given us two possible 
                         residences under that alias. We're 
                         hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking 
                         the other.

                              (eagerly)
                         Chicago's only about 400 miles from
                         here. I could be there in -

                         No, Starling, there isn't time. And 
                         you've still got crucial work to do 
                         in Ohio. We want him for murder, not 
                         kidnapping. I'm counting on you to 
                         link him to the Bimmel girl, before 
                         he's indicted.

               Clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir... I'll do my best.

                              (pause; gently)
                         Starling - you've earned back your 
                         place in the Academy. We never 
                         would've found him without you, and 
                         nobody's ever going to forget that. 
                         Least of all me.

               the fax machine starts to CHATTER. He turns, looks.

               Clarice walks slowly across the yard, absorbing all this 
               news, before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her 
               fist in triumph, with a happy yelp. Then she sees -

               MR. BIMMEL

               staring at her in surprise. He sits by his coops, smoking.

               CLARICE

               somewhat embarrassed, crosses over to him.

                         She sewed for everybody. Stores,

               her desk, talking to Clarice, who jots in her notebook. In 
               the background. beyond them, bank tellers, lines of waiting 
               customers, MUZAK.

                         somebody -

                         Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a 
                         man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?
                              (Stacy shakes her 
                              head)
                         Do you think she could've had a friend 
                         you didn't know about?

                                     STACY
                         No way. She had a guy, I'da known, 
                         believe me. Sewing was her life, she 
                         was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did you ever work with her?

                                     STACY
                         Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to 
                         help her do alterations for old Mrs. 
                         Lippman. Lots of people worked for 
                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? But she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she 
                         could handle.

                         Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd 
                         like to talk to her.

                                     STACY
                         She died. She went to Florida to 
                         retire, like two years ago? She dies 
                         own there.

               Clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail.

                                     STACY
                              (beat; shyly)
                         Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think so.

                                     STACY
                         You get to travel around and stuff? 
                         I mean, better places then this?

                         Freddie was so happy for me when I 
                         got this job. This - toaster

                         speakers all day - she thought this 
                         was really hot shit. What did she 
                         know, big dummy...

               Suddenly she's fighting tears. Clarice reaches to hug her.

               WIDE ANGLE on what appears to be, at first, a calm, ordinary 
               neighborhood of working class two- and three-story houses. 
               But the street is strangely quiet, deserted.

               After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, 
               dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs 
               to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing 
               and then disappearing...

               night-vision goggles over his eyes. Moths flutter past his 
               face. His mouth is set in a grim line...

               The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar 
               is bathed in a green glow...

               startled to find himself staring into the grim face of -

               A MEMBER OF THE HRT

               crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little 
               boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, 
               covering his mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so 
               delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past 
               him in the eerie light...

               A florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street 
               and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, 
               in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the 
               cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of 
               the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a 
               long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards 
               the house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and 
               closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom 
               of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up 
               at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. 
               Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up 
               to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head 
               and neck.

               MR. GUMB

               Looking down at her, smiles...

               MOVING ANGLE on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he 
               mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked 
               into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic.

               CRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS

               have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, 
               with drawn guns, watching tensely as -

               THE "DELIVERYMAN"

               settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches 
               out with his right hand towards the buzzer...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, 
               which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, 
               surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees -

               DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX

               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is 
               making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but 
               not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, 
               off screen, as -

               MR. GUMB

               raises his gun again, spinning back towards -

               HIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM

               where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly 
               yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the 
               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.

               MR. GUMB

               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to 
               safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, 
               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling.

                         Good afternoon... I wonder if you 
                         could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. 
                         Lippman's family?

               Mr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we 
               get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         They don't live here anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT DOOR OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY

               The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral 
               box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, 
               blowing it through as -

               MOVING ANGLE

               Crawford and Burroughs race towards the door, guns up...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Mr. Gumb starts to close the door, only to have Clarice push 
               back against it, politely but firmly. She holds up her ID.

                                     CLARICE
                         Excuse me, but I really do need to 
                         talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's 
                         house. Did you know her?

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (beat)
                         Just briefly. What's the problem, 
                         Officer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMENT CITY - DAY

               A bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot 
               through it, EXPLODING on the floor. An instant later, a black-
               clad HRT cop dives through the shattered glass, rolls across 
               the floor, comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed-off 
               shotgun...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Clarice and Mr. Gumb, still eyeing each other through the 
               door crack...

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm investigating the death of 
                         Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Jack Gordon.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica 
                         when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No. Wait... Was she a great, fat 
                         person? I may have seen her, I'm not 
                         sure...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE as Burroughs moves quickly down a hallway and 
               enters the living room, where Crawford is standing, with his 
               gun held down by his side, surrounded by several other cops. 
               Burroughs shakes his head: Nothing here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

               Mr. Gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his 
               kitchen, then turns back to Clarice with a smile.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he 
                         could help you. I have his card 
                         somewhere. Do you mind stepping 
                         inside, while I looks for it?

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks.

               ANGLE FAVORING THE COLT PYTHON

               which rests on a counter, just inside the open kitchen 
               doorway. THROUGH this doorway, we watch as Mr. Gumb, at the 
               end of his front hall, slips the chain. Clarice enters, 
               closing the door behind her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT YARD OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - towards the front door, as frustrated HRT 
               cops file out of the empty house, rifles slung across their 
               shoulders.

               WE PICK OUT CRAWFORD

               walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once 
               he stops in his tracks, shaken by a sudden flash of intuition.

               CAMERA RUSHES VERY CLOSE

               on his stricken face...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Clarice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S PARLOR - DAY

               Clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances 
               around the musty-looking room.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         That horrible business, I shiver 
                         every time I think about it...

               Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. One archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. His tone is casual, neutral.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Are they close to catching somebody, 
                         do you think?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think we may be, yes.

               Mr. Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. His back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after Mrs. Lippman died?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes. I bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did she leave any records here? Tax 
                         or business records? Maybe a list of 
                         employees?

               CLOSE ON MR. GUMB'S BACK

               as he continues his rummaging.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No, nothing at all. Has the FBI 
                         learned something? Because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth. 
               It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               CLARICE

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of 
               pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

                                     CLARICE
                         No... no, we don't.

               Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, 
               lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes 
               back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.

               MR. GUMB

               turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business 
               card.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Ahhh. Here's that number.

               CLARICE

               keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you 
                         have a phone I can use?

               MR. GUMB

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He 
               looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open.

               HER EYES

               are unmoving, locked on his.

               HIS EYES

               stare back at her, widen. And they know each other.

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         In the kitchen. I'll show you.

               CLARICE

               whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze!

               MR. GUMB

               slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.

               CLARICE

               tries to force more authority into her voice.

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under 
                         arrest. Down on the floor, hands and 
                         legs spread, move it.

               MR. GUMB

               turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, 
               disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.

               CLARICE

               hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - 
               and then it's too late.

                                     CLARICE
                         Shit!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun.

               HER POV - MOVING

               The kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering 
               on its hinges...

               CLARICE

               rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming 
               her gun down -

               AN EMPTY STAIRWELL

               brightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the 
               bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb.

               CLARICE

               hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: 
               she is very scared, but suddenly hears -

               The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there 
               in that killing maze.

               CLARICE

               rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs.

               BEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; 
               the Colt Python is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More 
               SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice 
               goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over-
               head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; 
               Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes 
               to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to 
               her left, and the BARKING of a dog...

               CLARICE

               follows her gun around the corner, looking right.

               EMPTY PASSAGEWAY

               but doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of 
               them. She looks left... sees an opening onto some kind of 
               chamber. The noises are LOUDER, coming from there.

               CLARICE

               moves cautiously towards this chamber...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUBLIETTE CHAMBER - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling...

               HER POV - MOVING

               the open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, 
               opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either 
               one of them, or come up behind her... She moves to the pit, 
               looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine SCREAMING, 
               hysterical, and a little white dog BARKING...

               CLARICE

               kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover 
               them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing 
               there?

                                     CLARICE
                         FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.
                         GET ME OUT!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're all right! Where is he?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me out!

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I 
                         can hear. Shut that dog up.
                              (still swivelling)
                         Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I don't know! Get me out!!

                                     CLARICE
                         Catherine. Listen to me. I have to 
                         find a rope. I have to leave this
                         room, just for a minute, but -

                                     CATHERINE
                         NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you 
                         LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU 

                                     CLARICE
                         Shut UP!
                              (then, louder)
                         The other officers will be here any 
                         minute! you're perfectly safe now!

               Ignoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs 
               away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it 
               quickly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW PASSAGEWAY - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING down this passageway, towards a new 
               room... pausing at the doorway, straining to hear... no sound 
               except Catherine's CRYING, not in the background, and 
               Clarice's own RAPID BREATHING. Then she crouches -

               LOWER ANGLE - bursts forward, through the doorframe, 
               sidestepping...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back 
               to the wall. Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in...

               HER POV - MOVING NERVOUSLY

               Mr. Gumb's sewing machine... his swivel chair... the old 
               Victrola... Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, 
               overhead; they're everywhere. Suddenly, from just behind 
               her, a CLICK and a HUM, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, almost shoots, before seeing -

               A SMALL REFRIGERATOR

               with its thermostat just switching ON.

               CLARICE

               gasps for breath, fighting for calm. She turns again, slashing 
               her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKINNING ROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... 
               then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot 
               into it. Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its 
               DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... 
               the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is

               A CLOSED DOOR

               Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, 
               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, 
               sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus 
               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Passing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a 
               half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously 
               skirted. She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound 
               inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She 
               twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun 
               inside, all in one quick move...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a 
               big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended 
               from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside.

               CLARICE

               centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks 
               it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something 
               lower down catches her eye.

               She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at 
               first, that she's seeing -

               FEMALE HAND AND WRIST

               sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple 
               plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish 
               and a dainty wristwatch. As -

               CLARICE

               is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to 
               be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow 
               of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns 
               blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand 
               clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. 
               SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice 
               stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches 
               the door frame...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms 
               out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of 
               her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved 
               darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of 
               the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified 
               BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths 
               smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then 
               stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following 
               her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -

               MR. GUMB

               who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a 
               high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and 
               kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, 
               like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed 
               suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a 
               ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, 
               completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. 
               Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his 
               gun in both hands, aiming...

               CLOSE ON

               the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the 
               hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her 
               gun muzzle, as we see -

               THE TWO FIGURES

               almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH 
               from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, 
               overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -

               CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -

               with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the 
               floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; 
               there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but 
               she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her 
               jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, 
               reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her 
               stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled 
               eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is 
               he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears 
               something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps 
               eight feet away...

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, 
               until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on 
               his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against 
               his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't 
               needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips 
               working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches 
               slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize 
               something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand 
               drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, 
               making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to 
               roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.

               OVERHEAD ANGLE

               down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers 
               on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that 
               her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto -

               A DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH -

               perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping 
               slowly.

               SOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK

               The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a 
               glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and 
               vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, 
               EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective 
               barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as

               CLARICE

               dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking 
               protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney.

               They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen 
               with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, 
               is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her 
               up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways 
               with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at 
               once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, 
               desperate for a familiar face.

               AN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. 
               He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, 
               stopping when he sees Clarice.

               THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

               for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with 
               sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any 
               words. And then he does.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling... your father sees you.

               And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, 
               but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. 
               HOLD ON them for a long beat.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Congratulations! You are now officers 
                         of the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY

               The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their 
               best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then 
               turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. 
               Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands 
               behind his podium.

               CLARICE AND ARDELIA

               look at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, 
               in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is 
               radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin 
               scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards 
               the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, 
               searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she 
               locates

               CRAWFORD

               who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little 
               salute.

               CLARICE

               grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to 
               wave towards the crowd with the others.

               MOVING ANGLE

               over the admiring sea of spectators, several hundred of them, 
               still rising from their folding chairs, APPLAUDING in 
               celebration of these special young people, this perfect, 
               sunlit day.

               SOUND UPCUT - rock music, laughter - as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ACADEMY DORM - REC ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               A LOUD party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new 
               grads celebrate ferociously. Ardelia weaves her way through 
               the crowded room, reaches Clarice, who is flanked by her 
               special guests - Pilcher and Roden, the two ardent scientists. 
               Ardelia has to shout at Clarice over the din.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Agent Starling! Telephone!

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised)
                         Agent Mapp! Thank you!

               She nods to Pilcher, leaves them. Roden, who is quite happily 
               drunk, grabs the startled Ardelia around the waist.

                                     RODEN
                         Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down.

               Ardelia looks at Pilcher, confused.

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily.

                                     CLARICE
                         Starling.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped 
                         screaming...?

               She freezes, stunned by the familiar voice. Then she turns, 
               waving frantically towards

               ARDELIA

               who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, 
               lost in conversation with Pilcher and Roden. Ardelia glances 
               at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Don't bother with a trace, I won't 
                         be on long enough.

               CLARICE

               turns back, gripping the phone more tightly.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A CLEAR NIGHT SKY

               Very beautiful, glittering with countless stars.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Where I have a view, Clarice...

               MOVING DOWN

               we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay. Boats ride at anchor, 
               lights shimmering...

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Orion is looking splendid tonight, 
                         and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his 
                         flock...

               DR. LECTER

               smiles into his mobile phone. He is stretched out on a 
               lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a 
               penknife. His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, 
               lighter hair. He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (into phone)
                         Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, 
                         but not forever... You'll have to 
                         earn it again and again, this blessed 
                         silence. Because it's the plight 
                         that drives you, and the plight will 
                         never end.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no plans to call on you, 
                         Clarice, the world being more 
                         interesting with you in it. Be sure 
                         you extend me the same courtesy.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         You know I can't make that promise.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Goodbye, Clarice...
                              (and then, softly)
                         You looked - so very lovely today, 
                         in your blue suit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               As Clarice reacts, the fill weight of his words sinking in.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!

               But only a DIAL TONE comes from the phone. She is still 
               staring at her receiver, in shock, as we -

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. THE MOONLIT PATIO

               Dr. Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises. Popping 
               an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the 
               brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled 
               body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open 
               french doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BOOKLINED STUDY

               In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books, is the writhing figure of Dr. Frederick Chilton. The 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's own 
               former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights.

               DR. LECTER

               Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little 
               pen-knife. His eyes are twinkling.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
SILVER BULLET by Stephen King Based on his story "Cycle of the Werewolf"


 
FADE IN:


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm late summer air.

SOUND: Crickets.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:


EXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT

CREDITS BEGIN.

A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is
ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino
pants. He is drinking beer.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses
it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.

ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox
on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He
shines it on the switch.

He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a
pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also
gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back
pocket.

ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT

He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the
light on the switch for a moment. During this:

		ARNIE (sings)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat, won't you try, won't you
	buy Rheingold beer...

He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.

		ARNIE
	Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!

He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and
drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then
he picks up his crowbar.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -
something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is
a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes
still hang from it.

What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as
wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we
should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick
ourselves for not knowing earlier.

It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on
the whole rail-rider.

CREDITS CONCLUDE.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as
hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly,
both the tracks and the switch move.

		ARNIE
	Hot damn! Now... a little oil...

He turns back toward the rail-rider.


EXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

		ARNIE
	It's not bitter, not sweet... it's
	a big fuckin' treat...

A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling.
ARNIE looks around.


EXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of
his tools.


EXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching
point.


EXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT

A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws
on that hand.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT

Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is
still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow.
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy
Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.


EXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the
long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving
the can.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...

He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.


EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of
course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,
half wolf, half human.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see
what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is
in extremely deep shit.

SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF  NIGHT

It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow
green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of
horror.

		ARNIE
	Oh n-

A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is
granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his
body.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand
reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.
The hand is dripping blood.

It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.

The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible
grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.

		WEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the
bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams
out.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW  NIGHT

He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth
and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU  NIGHT

The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins
to eat the bottle.

Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in
pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.

Looks up. It HOWLS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS  NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might
be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be
1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time
moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and
forth. No one is in a hurry.

We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);
Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett
neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see
the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.
We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia
Loren in "Two Women."
It's Our Town, U.S.A.

		JANE (voice-over)
	This place is Tarker's Mills, where I
	grew up... and this is how it was when I
	was fourteen - a place where people cared
	about each other as much as they cared
	about themselves. This is how my town
	looked as, all unknowing, it approached the
	rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.

SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.


EXT./INT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a
car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.
b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.
They both look around.
c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at
the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.


EXT.  THE SETTING MOON, CU  NIGHT

As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.

		JANE (v-o)
	The killing had begun, but at first no
	one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic
	drunk, and what happened seemed like an
	accident.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY  NIGHT

Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO
DAWN.

SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.

CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There
is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of
ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.

SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.

		JANE (v-o)
	The county coroner concluded that Arnie
	passed out on the tracks. There wasn't
	enough evidence to conclude anything else.

And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn
blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears
underneath. We see something flopping and moving under
there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON  DAY

The common is more or less in the center of town, either
surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on
the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but
the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE
TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!

Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been
set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked
breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit
down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are
tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.

		JOE HALLER (amplified voice)
	I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,
	of Holy Family Catholic Church!

Enthusiastic applause greets this.


INT.  THE CROWD  DAY

Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're
looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her
husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It
is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard
speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has
been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she
leans toward her mother.

		JANE
	I'm going out for a while, 'kay?

		NAN
	All right. Stay close. And make sure your
	brother's all right.

As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.

NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue
to wear it through the whole movie.


INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY

To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.
It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency
medical unit.

Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in
one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and
beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning
to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the
applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years...

No amplification. He taps the mike.


INT.  JANE

She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people
should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of
about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.

		GIRL (mocking)
	"Make sure your brother's all right."

		JANE (low)
	Marty's a booger.

She reaches the aisle and starts out.


INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE

He taps the mike again.


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW

		BOB (good-natured)
	Just pretend you're in your own church
	askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!

Good-natured laughter greets this.


INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM

A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF
SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years, I have had a
	dream. A dream of a time when modern
	medical care would come to this small
	community, which sometimes seems so far
	from Durham, with her lifesaving
	hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at
	which I see so many of my friends
	gathered, will be the start of making my
	dream come true.

SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.


EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU

It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling
through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF
APPLAUSE.

		MARTY (voice)
	Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're
	not poisonous?

		BRADY (voice)
	Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -
grab the blacksnake.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU

BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with
respectful wonder.

NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,
and will through the whole movie.

		MARTY
	Lemme hold him!

BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY
sees:


EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY

		JANE (v-o)
	I was almost fifteen that summer. My
	brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his
	friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I
	had to bear. Brady was actually the worse
	of the two, but I was rarely disposed to
	see that. Not when my younger brother was
	so constantly thrown in my face by my
	parents.

		LOWE (v-o from the tent)
	$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you
	think of the lives this unit might save, it
	seems very inexpensive indeed.

Applause greets this.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from
waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.

		BRADY
	I got an idea.

		MARTY
	What?

BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes
widen.

		MARTY
	You wouldn't.

BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.

		MARTY
	You would.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE

		LOWE
	An endeavor like this seems to me to be
	the very definition of community - all
	of us pulling together as one, farmers
	and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...


EXT.  JANE

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing
under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.

		BRADY (teasing voice)
	Jane... Jane...

She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost
touching her upturned face.

JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over
her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a
nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose
shredded at the knees.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing
wildly.


EXT.  JANE

She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's
near tears.


EXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT

The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part
of this little stunt, as he ought to be.

		MARTY
	It was just a blacksnake, Jane-


EXT.  JANE

She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and
something very close to hate.

		JANE
	Look at my knees! Look at my dress!
	I hate you!


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her
	teddies?


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Stop it, Brady.


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

He throws the snake.


EXT.  JANE

She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning
to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.


EXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Ooooh, naughty!


EXT.  MARTY

He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural
in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for
the time being we must be puzzled.

		MARTY
	Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We
	didn't mean-

He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.

		JANE
	Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,
	you booger!

She runs away.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He swings down and comes over to MARTY.

		BRADY (with satisfaction)
	Really got her goat that time.


EXT.  MARTY

He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.

		MARTY
	Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.


EXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY

She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she
steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt
of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.

		STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)
	Wait! Don't go!

Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress
down. No one in sight.

		MAN (voice; rough)
	Just leave me alone!

Now she looks toward:


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV

A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who
has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about
the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the
bandstand.

STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to
the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -
but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara
Falls.

		STELLA (calls)
	Please! You have to help me!


EXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER

		DECEIVER (keeps walking)
	It's your oven, but it ain't my bun
	you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.

B.g. SOUNDS: More applause.


EXT.  JANE

We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the
bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.
JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in
this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the
stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose
absently in a litter can.

JANE mounts the steps timidly.

		JANE
	Stella? Is that you?


EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is
bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she
is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the
sound of JANE's voice.

		STELLA (alarmed)
	Who - ?

		JANE (approaching closer)
	It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.

STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.
JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she
approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.

		JANE (tenderly)
	What's wrong?

		STELLA (weeping)
	He's going away. I know he is.

		JANE
	Who's going away?

STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.

		STELLA
	What am I going to tell my mother? If
	he won't marry me, what am I going to
	tell my mother?

		JANE (bewildered)
	Stella, I don't know what-

		STELLA
	Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me
	alone, you stupid thing!

STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE
stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little
frightened.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION

		O'BANION
	Let us pray.


INT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING

Most of them bow their heads.


INT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM

		O'BANION
	May the Grace of God shine upon those
	gathered here... and lift them up... and
	grant success to the endeavor to which
	they have so openheartedly declared their
	support. Amen.


INT.  THE GATHERING

They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross
themselves.


EXT.  THE PICNIC AREA

People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down.


EXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

Traveling along a country road. Headed home.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are
in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.
She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.

MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the
wagon.

NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE
she's mad at.

		NAN
	I want you two to bury the hatchet.
	You're being very silly, Jane.

		JANE (hot)
	Did you see my knees?

		MARTY
	Jane, I-

		NAN
	I think you're being mean as well as
	silly. Your brother has never had a
	scraped knee in his whole life.

Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against
her brother and the source of most of the tension in the
COSLAW family.

MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this
always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how
to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.

		JANE
	You always take his side because he's a
	cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's
	a cripple!

		MARTY
	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I
	couldn't stop him.

		JANE
	Brady's a booger and so are you!

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

		BOB (roars)
	Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of
	you out!

In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of
Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains
thundery.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

Train tracks run near the road.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY

		BOB (points)
	That's where poor old Arnie Westrum
	pitched his last drunk.

He crosses himself and they all look toward:


EXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV)


INT.  THE CAR  DAY

		BOB
	They had to pick up what was left of
	him in a peach basket.

		JANE
	Oh, Daddy! Gross!

		MARTY
	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?
	That's what Brady said.

		JANE
	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit.
	I mean it.

		NAN (no sympathy)
	You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I
	think we've all had quite enough of this
	horror-movie talk.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER  DAY

Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust.
His face is thoughtful, solemn.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls
on her unhappy face as the door is opened.

		MARTY (v-o)
	Janey?... Are you awake?

JANE says nothing.


INT.  THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY  NIGHT

He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he
was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get
a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A
box, for sure.

		MARTY
	Can I come in?


INT.  JANE

Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the
wall.


INT.  MARTY

He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night
table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over
and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can
of mixed nuts.

		JANE
	What's the money for?

		MARTY
	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

		JANE
	I don't want your money. You're a booger.

		MARTY
	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God.
	Please take the money. I want to make up.

She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite.
She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.

		JANE
	I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the
	pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.

She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She
picks it up, curious.

		MARTY
	That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it
	to me-

		JANE (scorn)
	That drunk!

		MARTY
	-but I want you to have it.

He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother
is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has
been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly
at him.

		MARTY
	Yeah, go ahead.

She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring
inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.

		JANE
	You booger!

MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.

		MARTY (grinning)
	It really is for your birthday, though -
	try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.

		JANE
	Go to hell!


INT.  MARTY, BY THE DOOR

		MARTY (smiling)
	I love you, Janey.


INT.  JANE, IN BED

She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a
response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL
evoke). She smiles at him a little.


INT.  MARTY

He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and
leaves.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON  NIGHT

We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.

SOUND: A HOWL.


EXT.  A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY

There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also
downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.

An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.

SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE

STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.


INT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU

A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her
vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the
mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.

[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the
window!]

There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the
vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty
prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture.
We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also
a large glass of water on the vanity table.

STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but
probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills,
starts to lift them to her mouth-

A HOWL outside... closer.

STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with
some water. She pauses, looking at herself.

		STELLA
	Suicides go to hell. Especially if
	they're pregnant. And I don't even care.

She takes another five pills. And another five.

SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.


EXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT

Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse,
guttural breathing.


INT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE

She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind
her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the
werewolf throws itself through.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

She sits up, startled awake.

From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A
SCREAM.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA

She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of
her nightgown.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

		MOTHER
	Oh my dear God... Stella!

She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a
confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering
glass.


INT.  STELLA'S BED, CU

One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping
through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.

Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.


EXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE

The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.

SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL.


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER

She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it
gamely along.

		MOTHER
	Stella!...Stella!

She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates
there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.

A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


INT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU

She shrieks again.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE

It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the
mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is
broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy
wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.

STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around
her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure
isn't what happened.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING

a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the
"Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The
scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can
see STELLA'S photograph.
b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see
the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a
bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER,
VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer
we'll meet later.
c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big
hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON
SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY!
d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out
and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the
parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.


EXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET

The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE.


INT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL

Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY.
And below this: JOSEPH HALLER.

		JOE HALLER (voice)
	Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER

HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks
like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy
deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly
found himself batting in the World Series.

		PETE
	What'd they say, Joe?

		HALLER
	They said they'd be here by noon.

		PETE (nervous)
	Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling
	that Smokey Bear from the Detective
	Division to fuck off, Joe.

		HALLER (morosely)
	I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a
	mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's
	go on out there.

He gets slowly up.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL  AFTERNOON

It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy
climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along
one side of the building.

SOUND: The bell rings.

A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids
spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they
are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids
book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes
and riding or just running.

Everyone has a pink report card.


EXT.  A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY
STURMFULLER

BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of
a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver
Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.
Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing
car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with
a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright
metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.
Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have
thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER
BULLET.

		BRADY
	Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and
	the Silver Bullet!

TAMMY laughs.

		BRADY
	You glad to be back in jail, Marty?

		MARTY
	Sure - I like school.

		TAMMY
	You booger.

		MARTY
	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty
	soon I'm going to start checking the
	mirror to see if I'm turning green.

		BRADY
	I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.


EXT.  THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WALNUT, A WIDER SHOT  AFTERNOON

TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his
bike.
MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He
bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by
side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY FROM THE FAR CURB, REVERSE

He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the
little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!

		MARTY
	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the
	regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.

		TAMMY
	What's that?

		MARTY
	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime
	this summer and we'd soup up the engine...
	but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and
	he's in the doghouse with my mother.

		TAMMY
	For getting a divorce?

		MARTY
	Well... it is his third.


EXT.  A STREET ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, WITH MARTY AND
TAMMY

The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has
ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road.
They look toward:


EXT.  THE RANDOLPH HOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the
stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled
with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of
state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.

We can see a large black wreath on the door.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		TAMMY
	Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was
	scared to go past her house by myself.

		MARTY (matter-of-fact)
	Yeah... it is a little scary.

		TAMMY
	I mean, I saw her. All the time.

TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.

		TAMMY
	I used to see her every day, and she never
	knew what was going to happen to her, and
	neither did I! I mean I know how stupid
	that sounds, but...

		MARTY
	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.

He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal
along to catch up.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

They stop at the end.

		TAMMY
	There's something else scary.

		MARTY
	What?

		TAMMY (points)
	That.


EXT.  OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place.
Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many
- have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle
of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a
mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She is quite deeply troubled.

		TAMMY
	I've been hearing noises in there.

		MARTY
	What kind of noises?

		TAMMY
	Rattling. Rustling.

		MARTY
	Rats...

		TAMMY
	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not
	rats and it's not kids. It's-


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT

Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic
for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of
pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap
with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of
beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold
the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching
his crotch.

		MILT
	Tammy, you get on in here and do some
	dishes!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE

Sinister...spooky.

		TAMMY (voice)
	I've got to go.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'd go out and take a look myself, but I
	think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden.
	It looks sorta greasy.

She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth.
MARTY is stunned... but happy.

		TAMMY
	You would, wouldn't you?

		MARTY (Joe Cool)
	Sure. No sweat.

		TAMMY
	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked
	since... you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises,
	tell your father. Okay?

		TAMMY
	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,
	Marty?

		MARTY (Startled)
	Jeez!


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV

There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.

		MILT (voice)
	TAMMY!

		TAMMY (calls)
	Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks
	again for coming home with me.

She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors
back onto the street and turns toward town.


EXT.  TAMMY

She brings her bike to a stop by her father.

		MILT
	'Bout time. Why you want to hang around
	that cripple?

		TAMMY
	I like him.

		MILT
	Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.
	Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance
	the fucking budget.

Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now
scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward
THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.


EXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW


			DISSOLVES TO:


EXT.  MARTY

He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some
distance away - but at least he's made it back to the
sidewalk again.

		MARTY (prayerfully)
	Come on, baby-

He looks down at:


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

Now the needle is lying all the way over on "E."


EXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON

MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug
and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the
island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS
comes over.

		VIRGIL
	Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!

		MARTY
	Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?

		VIRGIL
	Want me to check the oil?

		MARTY
	Sure!

		VIRGIL
	Wipe the windshield an check the driver's
	bullshit level?

MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the
Silver Bullet's small tank.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you
	a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a
	Rod Carew.


INT.  THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW  NIGHT

She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she
just bit into a lemon.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's
thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got
both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with
butts.

He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball
cards. Each has a pile in front of him.

MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he
looks at him.

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. I call.

He tosses in three baseball cards.

		UNCLE AL
	Wait a minute, wait a minute!

He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it
back.

		UNCLE AL
	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager!
	Stone the crows!

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

		UNCLE AL
	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.

He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.


INT.  THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE

NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She
favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at
MARTY.

		NAN
	Come on, Marty- bedtime.

She starts to wheel him away.

		MARTY
	Mom-!

		UNCLE AL
	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back
to the table.

		NAN
	Make it quick.

UNCLE AL lays down his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	Three kings.

		MARTY (delighted)
	I got a straight to the queen!

		UNCLE AL
	Bullshit luck!

		NAN (outraged)
	That's enough!

		MARTY (as his mother wheels him away)
	Aww, Mom-!


INT.  THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME

MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the
second floor. He looks dejected and glum.

SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can
make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women
like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian
household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even
bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.

A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is
no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by
arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY
hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down
the hall toward the bathroom.

Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I
mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another
is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile
of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the
table bending down to pick them up.

		NAN
	I don't want you drinking around Marty.
	That's too much. If you can't stop it,
	you better stay away.

AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this
man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal
drunkenness so we can see it.

		UNCLE AL
	I come here because Marty needs a friend.

		NAN
	Yes... you've always been that to him.
	But if you can't leave your booze in
	whatever dump you call home, you better
	just stay away.

She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after
her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering
ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire
but creating something that looks even worse. He begins
drunkenly picking up again.

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's
	house! Heeyyy!


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM

MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.

JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.

		MARTY
	Mom was really mad at him this time,
	wasn't she?

		JANE
	What do you expect, when he comes in
	smelling like a brewery and looking like
	an unmade bed?

		MARTY
	Stop it!

He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY
overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush
clatters across the tile.

		BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice)
	Hey! That you, Marty?

		JANE
	He's okay, Dad!

She looks around swiftly, then bends down.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT

One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes
are shut. He's weeping.

		JANE (low)
	Marty, are you all right?

		MARTY
	Yes. Go away.

		JANE
	Let me help you up.

		NAN (voice)
	Marty?

SOUND of her climbing the stairs.

JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then
helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink
counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please
don't tell on me," it says.

NAN comes in.

		NAN
	Jane, have you been teasing your
	brother again?

		MARTY
	She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush
	and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane
	helped pick me up.

He bats his eyes at her.

		MARTY (syrupy voice)
	Jane's wunnnderful.

JANE picks up his toothbrush.

		JANE (hands it to him)
	Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that
	shit in your head might leak down into your
	mouth and poison you.

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good
put-down.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT

We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to
pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She's deeply asleep.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door
closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from
the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer
pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer
in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.

		MILT (drunk)
	Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something-
one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and
SHATTERS.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT

He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on
the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.

		MILT (all eyes again)
	Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER

A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.


INT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM

Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks
out.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)

SOUND of another crash. Plants move.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT

He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks
inside.

		MILT
	Let's see if you want to come back and
	break my pots all to shit after I put
	some rock salt in your asses!


INT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding
the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is
really overgrown.

MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the
director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense.
I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe
even a big plump spider- will land on him.

He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.

		MILT (shouts)
	Who's there?


INT.  GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV  NIGHT

A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have
pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).


INT.  MILT  NIGHT

He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to
happen, but it keeps not happening.

Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big,
hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two
of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-
and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.

SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.

MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it
is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is
pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only
from the knees up.


INT.  TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM

She sits up in bed.

SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.

MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in
rollers, comes into Tammy's room.

		MRS. STURMFULLER
	Tammy, where's your father?

SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.


INT.  THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT

He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by
broken, splintered boards.

SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.

He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from
the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning,
splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over
it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.

A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked
all the way into the hole, board and all.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER

They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG  DAY

The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As
we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER
are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas
bags.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER

He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the
bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3  DUSK

a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home,
obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and
nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the
endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she
lurches inside and slams the door.
b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER
O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them.
c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some
plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him,
the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him
in.
d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an
automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a
pugnacious, unpleasant look.
e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber
shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to
make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I
guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE
CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's,
where he also goes in.
f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The
"Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS
SECOND VICTIM.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID  MAGIC HOUR

They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the
b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as
he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on
Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.

In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL)
WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at
the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.

Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER
ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at
the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY
McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER
LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing
a beer and listening closely to the conversation.

		ELMER (to VIRGIL)
	Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man
	up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!

		VIRGIL
	But the woman's bed was ripped right down
	the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to
	do something like that!

		PORTER
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter. (To VIRGIL) What about the
	tracks?

ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.

		VIRGIL
	That could be something to throw off the
	cops. And it ain't animals that try to
	confues the law; it's people do that.

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Law around here don't need much confusing.

PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and
ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.

		ANDY (deep disgust)
	Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if
	someone rammed it full of radium and gave
	him a Geiger counter.

		PETE SYLVESTER (comes over)
	Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd
	over getting fined two hundred bucks for
	that little fender bender out on the Ridge
	Road last year.

		ANDY
	Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to
	take care of his mouth before someone comes
	along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe
	Haller's salary to keep the people in this
	town safe, and he ain't doing it.


INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR

He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.

		BILLY (mildly)
	Last town report said you was in arrears
	your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid
	up, huh?


INT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY
	What are you, trying to be smart?

OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.

		OWEN
	You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm
	gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?

		ANDY (sulks)
	Bring me a Schlitz.


EXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK

SOUND of panting.

MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms.
His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply
behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch,
untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.

		MARTY (calls)
	Here it comes!


EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY

		BRADY
	Drop it!

As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.

		JANE
	Marty Coslaw, you get down out of
	that tree!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE

He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.

		MARTY
	Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (makes no immediate move to do so)
	Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.

		MARTY (hanging)
	Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?

		JANE
	They both are. At me, for not getting you
	sooner. I ought to let you fall.

But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He
pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.


EXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK

		MARTY (voice)
	Hey, Brady! You coming?

		BRADY (looking into the sky)
	In a while!

BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves
vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks
in Marin County might say.


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.

		JANE
	Come on, Marty.

She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and
looks at:


EXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the
bluish-purple sky.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK

The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of
LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have
appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR.
ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A
barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.

Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair
amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's
more belligerent than ever.

		ANDY (holding forth)
	This whole investigation has been as
	efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-

		PETE (bravely)
	I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If
	you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to
	shut it for you.


INT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE

It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes
in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.


INT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY (astounded)
	What did you say?


INT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER

		OWEN
	Jesus wept.

He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat.
Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically
toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries
around the bar with it.


INT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP

PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face
trembling with determination.

		PETE
	You heard what I said, motormouth.

ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a
brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table.
HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems
of his own.


INT.  HERB KINCAID

He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't
like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the
imperatives of the situation demand it right now.

		HERB (quite loudly)
	Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?


INT.  THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE

Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE
freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing
statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and
PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.


EXT.  THE TOWN COMMON, LONG

Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer
moon is rising over the horizon.

SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the
door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright
overlies each face.

NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.


INT.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL

JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry,
letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun
belt.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND

BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the
steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face
grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

		HERB
	Brady!

He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.

		HERB
	Get out of my way!

He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE
and several of the others.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND  NIGHT

		JOE HALLER (low voice)
	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
	thee. Blessed art thou among women...

He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his
side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of
his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down
two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S
smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at
nothing.

		HALLER (low)
	...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.
	Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
	us sinners now...now...

He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over
his face and starts to cry.


EXT.  THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET  NIGHT

A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a
few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID
is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.

SOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID

As HERB KINCAID approaches.

		HALLER
	Stay off the bandstand, Herb.

		HERB
	Is it my boy? Is it Brady?

		HALLER
	Don't go up-

		HERB (lunges past him)
	Brady! Brady!

Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.

		HERB
	Br-(CUTS OFF)

The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look
up.

		PETE
	Joe, is it-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh.

		PETE
	Is it the Kicaid b-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh, I said.

The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON
shoves forward.

		ANDY
	What the fuck is going on h-

SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men
flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness
on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back
further, looking more uneasy than ever.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	We'll bury his shoes.

Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury
	his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan
	cigar boxes.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV  NIGHT

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his
son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.

		HERB
	We'll bury his shoes because his feet are
	still in them and they're the only part of
	him that makes sense anymore.

HERB laughs harder.

		HERB
	It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this
	town ever saw!

HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON
BRADY'S KITE.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

SOUND: HERB SCREAMING.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In
The Sheaves."

There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but
there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG.
MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.

		JANE (v-o)
	My mother and father- my mother in
	particular- did not much care for Uncle
	Al...


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the
mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ.
BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course.
There are lots of flowers.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...but when it came to such unpleasant
	duties as taking Marty to the funeral
	of his best friend...


INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW

As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,
TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.

UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his
hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the
word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He
pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...they didn't at all mind drafting him.
	As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may
	have been able to offer him...

UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him
questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at
TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking
away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers
her the flask. Her eyes widen.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...I now believe that was best kept between
	the two of them...

After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask
and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,
who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her
mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL
smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as
if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER
looks distractedly back toward the service.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...or among the three of them.

UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. There
	will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid
	this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word
	of comfort to you, if I could.

He looks out at them.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION

They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in
understanding this awful thing.


INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN

		LOWE
	If there is any word of comfort I can give
	you, it's just this: the face of the beast
	always becomes known; the time of the beast
	always passes.

He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.

		LOWE
	If there are times when we feel alone and
	afraid, only small creatures in the dark,
	then these are the times when we must turn
	to one another for our comfort and our hope.
	To our neighbors. To our community. To our
	love for each other. I alone cannot ease
	the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can
	I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if
	I believe anything it's this: we can comfort
	each other. We can heal each other. We can
	go on together.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she
puts her head on his shoulder.


INT.  FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	The Bible tells us not to fear the terror
	that creepeth by night or that which flieth
	by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because
	there is much we don't know, and we feel
	very small. But we must not be alone. We must
	not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is
	the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to
	each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try
	to remember that the face of the beast always
	becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast
	always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.


EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY

MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins
to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would
think- and she and MARTY embrace.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU

He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY
home.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	You all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	Yeah.

		UNCLE AL
	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than
	a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You
	ever hear that one?

		MARTY
	No.

		UNCLE AL
	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They
	better get the guy.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?

		UNCLE AL
	Huh?

		MARTY
	What if it's some kind of monster?

		UNCLE AL (laughs)
	Jesus, Marty! Come off it!


EXT.  UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET

It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front,
but there are also lots of pickup trucks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?

		UNCLE AL
	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend
	they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't
	anybody ever tell you that the only monsters
	are in comic books and drive-in movies?


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  LATE AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in
	that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a
	big animal. Her father was killed that night.

UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost
believing. Then he shakes his head.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, you have to get this idea out of
	your head. Psychotics are more active
	when the moon is full, and this guy is a
	psycho. He's going to turn out to be as
	human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of
	speaking. Now let's get you inside.

He opens his door and gets out.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER

He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE AFTERNOON

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Okay, you all know what group you're in and
	what area you'll be covering, right?

		PORTER ZINNEMAN
	Damn straight!

		ELMER ZINNEMAN
	Shut up, Porter.

The men are all dressed in hunting clothes-
red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all
have guns. Among their number are a few women as well,
looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've
met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply
troubled.

ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his
vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho
football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they
really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for
the Gipper.

		ANDY
	Groups one through four are in the woods
	north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and
	six west of Carson Creek.

The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE
HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much
from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort
of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to
explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie
and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has
seriously weakened his authority.

		ANDY (continuing)
	Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.

Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and
PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up
next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.

		ANDY (continuing)
	If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight
	tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.


INT.  THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER

		PORTER (happily)
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter.


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not
	each other. So look before you-


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER

		HALLER
	I want all of you folks to go home!

A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit,
and turns to face them.

		HALLER
	I can't remember deputizing a single one
	of you!


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is
	that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one
	of you has done a damn thing about solving
	this case.

There is a mutter of agreement.


INT.  A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER

ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.
we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing
a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).

		HALLER (without much force)
	We'll catch him.

		ANDY
	You couldn't catch a cold.

HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the
crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we
see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER
speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.

		HALLER
	The law has a name for what you men are
	planning. It's private justice, and private
	justice is about a step and a half away
	from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no
	J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's
	Mills, and I want you men to go home.

They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is
getting to them.

		ANDY
	Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done
	since this thing started but hang his face out?

It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both
ANDY and themselves.

		ANDY (louder)
	He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!

		OWEN KNOPFLER
	Ah, shut up, Andy.

		ANDY
	Don't tell me to-

HERB KINCAID steps forward.

		HERB
	Yes. Correct. Shut up.

ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks
grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.

		HERB (quietly)
	I just came from my boy's funeral.

		HALLER
	Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken
	you must be...but-

		HERB (quietly)
	He was torn apart.

Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,
rapt.

		HALLER
	Yes. Yes, but-

		HERB (still quiet)
	Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.
	Constable, you don't know what those words
	mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!

HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his
face.

		HERB
	My son was torn to pieces!
		(turning back to HALLER)
	You come in here and talk to these men
	about private justice. You dare to do that.
	Constable Haller, why don't you go out to
	Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady
	and explain to him about private justice.
	Would you want to do that?

HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.

		HERB
	No. I thought not.
		(to the others)
	You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't
	ask anyone to do anything that runs counter
	to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out
	and hunt up a little private justice.

ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at
the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other
men start to follow.


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB

Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and
pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing
out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some
high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood
is up.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his
way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.
He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.

		LOWE
	Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...

		BILLY (not looking at LOWE)
	Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.

He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says
he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER
ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of
others with mounting desperation.

HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and
draws him aside.

		HALLER
	Let them go.

		LOWE
	But-

		HALLER
	This is that spirit of community you were
	talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll
	shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can
	mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit
	the Medcu van, of course.

HALLER laughs.

		LOWE
	But can't we do anything?

OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one
shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the
peacemaker bat.

		HALLER
	Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them
	get killed.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S

More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford
"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing
impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and
BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman
named MAGGIE ANDREWS.

OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.

		ANDY
	Well, it's about frigging time! They'll
	have his hide tacked to somebody's barn
	door before we get out there!

They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it
into gear and backs out onto Main Street.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE

We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of
town.


EXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE

He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in
procession, some honking their horns, others yelling
cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT


EXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT

ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a
barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged.
The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see
ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.

		ELMER
	Help me Porter, goddammit!

PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING
SOUND. ELMER screams.

		ELMER
	Don't pull me! You want to rip the right
	cheek of my ass right off?

		PORTER
	Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say
	you've been half-assed most of your-

		ELMER
	Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?

PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.


EXT.  IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS
NIGHT

O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that
priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.

SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD

		VIRGIL
	Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.

		O'BANION
	Come on. Be careful.

They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some
knee-high brush.

SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.

O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.

		VIRGIL
	Rev'runt! What is it?

		O'BANION (screaming)
	My foot! My foot!

VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.


EXT.  O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV

A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably
catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty
teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.


EXT.  O'BANION AND VIRGIL

		O'BANION (SCREAMING)
	Get it off me! Get it off me!

		VIRGIL (flustered)
	Sure...okay...

He kneels down.


EXT.  VIRGIL

He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.


EXT.  O'BANION

Relaxing.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.


EXT.  VIRGIL

Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his
hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.


EXT.  REVEREND O'BANION

He screams.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

It slides behind a cloud.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING.


EXT.  ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP

ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and
MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR.
ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.

They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES.
We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has
gone out of the evening.

They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is
filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of
it. There are woods on the far side.

		ANDY (pointing across)
	It came from over there.

		BOBBY ROBERTSON
	As far as I could tell, it could have come
	from anywhere.

		ANDY
	We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the
	bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.

		BOBBY
	I dunno-

		MAGGIE
	I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade
	in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in
	it, Bobby?

ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY
McCLAREN smile a little.

		OWEN (quietly)
	Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.

		BOBBY (stoutly)
	I ain't scared! Let's go!

		ANDY
	Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE

Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still
over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is
holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY
McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.

They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for
anything- at least, they think so.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT

They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their
way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push
toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.

SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.

They all stop, scared.

		BILLY McCLAREN
	Where's it coming from? Other side?

		BOBBY
	No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't
	trust-

		ASPINALL
	It isn't on either side.

		ANDY
	What are you-

ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.

		ASPINALL
	It's under the fog. It's right in with us.

The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:

SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.

SOUND: A SCREAM.


EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE

He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,
that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.
He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He
goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and
then it disappears.

SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.

ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a
drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE

They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in
the ranks where EDGAR was.


EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU

		BOBBY (moaning)
	I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE

The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE
LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath.


EXT.  ASPINALL, CU

		ASPINALL (low)
	I think we better start backing up, Andy.
	Real slow. Real-

The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist,
snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S
voice:

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"

SOUND: CHOMP!

ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist.
There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face
is gone.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow!"

A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP

They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one
side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.


EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV

THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like
being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.

		WEREWOLF (voice; laughing)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"


EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER

He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He
whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.

		OWEN
	Come on, then! You want to rock and roll
	with me?


EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV

For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises
out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with
gore.

		WEREWOLF
	"REEEEEL SLOW!"


EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY

		MAGGIE (shrieking)
	Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!

		ANDY (groaning with fear)
	I don't want to look at it.

He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:


EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF

The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with
the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and
slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.

		OWEN
	Come on, come on! You want to do the bop?
	I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!

The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.

Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his
hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The
peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN
shrieks.

		OWEN (voice)
	Come on, you bastard!

The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands
holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM
from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the
WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.


EXT.  THE RAVINE

THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping
down the draw.

Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a
congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the
accompaniment of a pipe organ.

		WEREWOLF (sing-songy voice)
	Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the
	sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing
	in the sheaves...

THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn
overwhelm it and we

				DISSOLVE TO:


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING

It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners
are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair
parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and
MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S
funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that
event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's
below us. The hymn ends.


INT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. They
	did ask me to say a word of comfort to you
	if I could.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID

He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.

		HERB
	There is no comfort, Father. Only private
	justice.


INT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an
actor trying to remember his lines.

		LOWE
	Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can
	give you, it's just this: the face of the
	beast always becomes known; the time-

He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.


INT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV

Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was
formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.

		LOWE
	The time... the time of the beast always
	passes. There are answers... ways... ways
	to... to cope... if we turn to each other...

		HERB (bestial voice)
	Father-

LOWE looks toward:


INT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV

He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up
and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green.
As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning
into a werewolf.

		HERB (snarling)
	It tore out his heart.

And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart
up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming
paws.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He staggers back, in terror.

		LOWE (shrieks)
	No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the
church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.

		CONGREGATION
	Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of
	kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the
	dewy eve...

We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is
happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks
up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are
split. He grins, showing big teeth.

They are all changing. Among the things we see are:

PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the
aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two
of them grapple in the aisle.

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket
covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already
the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.

TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;
the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.

At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters
of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled
hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the
organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee
Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the
tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."
It changes into the Rheingold jingle.

		CONGREGATION (snarling chorus)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


INT.  LOWE

FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.
The man is in an extremity of terror.

		REV. LOWE
	No! No! No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at
each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of
them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves-
for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the
aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously,
singing.

		CONGREGATION (snarling it out)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat...


INT.  LOWE

He looks toward:


INT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN

She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold
jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to
bubble up between the keys.

		MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL
	Won't you try, won't you buy...


INT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION

The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing
werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell.

		CONGREGATION (big finish)
	...Rheiinngold beer!

Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins.
And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them,
bites the hand's claw off.


INT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM

He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where
there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY
KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a
zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like
it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.

BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU

He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running
down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy
and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an
expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.

		LOWE (praying)
	Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please
	let it end.


EXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY

An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY
STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with
possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff
in it.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		HALLER (indifferently)
	Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.

		PETE
	Yeah... but what are they doing?

		HALLER
	Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
	cap, I deduce that they are leaving.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY

They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which
perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place
is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.


EXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK

		HALLER
	She's not the only one. Lot of people
	leaving town. And I guess if we want a
	beer, we'll have to drink it at home.

He nods toward:


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV)

A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black
wreath.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		PETE
	Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't
	never seen you like this.

		HALLER (thoughtful)
	I lost my guts.

		PETE (startled)
	Bullshit.

		HALLER
	It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him...
	and I felt it happen. It was no big deal.
	No worse than pissing down your own leg.
	You ever do that? Maybe when you were
	real scared?

PETE, distressed, does not respond.

		HALLER
	One minute I had me some guts- as much as
	the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.

PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.

		PETE
	Joe... you are going to feel better than
	this. This... this feeling of yours...
	it's gonna pass...

		JOE
	Is it?

He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign
out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while
PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.


EXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY

It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted.

THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS
FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON
EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND!

A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued
diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED.
		MARTY (voice)
	It's not fair.


INT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY

It's parked across the road from the sign.

		JANE (voice)
	Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't
	get something he wanted!

They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at
this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream
cones; they are coming home from a family outing.

		NAN COSLAW
	Stop it, Jane.

		JANE
	Well, I don't see why everybody just about
	breaks down and cries whenever he-

		BOB
	Stop it, your mother said.

They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB
pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE IN THE BACKSEAT

JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.


EXT.  ANGLE ON THE COSLAW GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the
CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.


INT.  THE GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver
Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working
through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE
AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor
and pulls it off.

		MARTY
	It isn't enough that the monster killed all
	those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's
	got them to cancel the fair.

		UNCLE AL
	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.

MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed
Shop" printed on it.

		MARTY
	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's
	all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing
	that is just a... a...

		UNCLE AL
	It's just an outward symbol of everything
	that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not
	bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in
	college. I can jive that shit all day.

		MARTY
	Well... I like it that you always know how
	to say things, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my
	ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested
	to hear that.

		MARTY
	Don't call me dear boy.

		UNCLE AL
	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.

		UNCLE AL
	Look at this.

He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated
four-barrel.

		UNCLE AL (gleeful)
	This is gonna turn your wheelchair into
	a fucking F-14, Marty-

He looks around quickly, guiltily.

		UNCLE AL
	Your mom's not around, is she?

		MARTY
	She and dad are out back lighting the
	barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's
	King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

		UNCLE AL
	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be
	Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that
	adjustable.

MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and
starts attaching bolts.

		UNCLE AL
	The guy killed your best friend, drove your
	girl out of town, and stole the second-best
	holiday in the year. Have I got it right?

		MARTY (glum)
	You got it right, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that...
	but I got something that just might cheer
	you up.

		MARTY
	What?

		UNCLE AL
	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, AT THE SIDE OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  DAY

He peeks into the backyard.


EXT.  THE BACK YARD, UNCLE AL'S POV

BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a
badminton birdie.


EXT.  THE ROAD IN FRONT OF COSLAWS', WITH MARTY

MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.

UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.

		UNCLE AL
	All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.

MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the
tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a
poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a
hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.

MARTY looks startled.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Gun it.

MARTY guns it. The engine roars.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus! Not too much!

		MARTY (awed)
	Wow.

		UNCLE AL
	You got a pilot's license, Marty?

		MARTY
	Do I need one?

		UNCLE AL
	We're gonna find out. Take it down the
	road a ways and back. Be careful.

MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but
he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving
along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the
hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying
this.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING

He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!
VRROOM!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU

A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle
engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.

SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!


EXT.  MARTY, CU

Grinning. Looking at:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV

It's about a quarter of a mile away.


EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver
Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts
back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that
of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a
motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on
his face.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG

Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke
jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the
seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's
laughing like a lunatic.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	The kid's dead meat. What have I done?
		(shouts)
	Put a rock in it, Marty!


EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET

He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing
rubber.


EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL

The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near
UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns
the engine once and then lets it idle.

		UNCLE AL
	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm
	dying. I hope you're happy, because you
	are looking at a dying man.

		MARTY
	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother
	finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have
	a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna
	Boys' Choir.

		MARTY
	I don't get you.

		UNCLE AL
	I know you don't. But I want this to be our
	secret. You get that, don't you?

		MARTY
	Sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Good.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD

The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs
on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the
f.g.

		UNCLE AL
	I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.

He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.

		NAN
	So have I, actually... I wish it could always
	be like this.

		UNCLE AL
	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure
	I stay out of trouble at least that long.

		MARTY
	Okay.

He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them
with troubled love.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Now I said I had something for you, as
	I believe you will recall.

		MARTY
	Yeah! What is it?

AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper
shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens
the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches
in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,
Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.

An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he
inventories these goodies.

		UNCLE AL
	You're gonna have the Fourth of July in
	October, Marty. Just don't blow your head
	off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't
	just the fireworks. It's because no crazy
	shithead should be able to stop the good
	guys, if you can dig that.

		MARTY (respectfully)
	I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!

		UNCLE AL
	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake-
	someone's killing people. I have to be out of
	my mind to be doing this, you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah, I know. It's great!

		UNCLE AL
	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that
	you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't
	set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?
	Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?

		MARTY
	Yeah... sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Save this one for last.

He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A
fat fuse sticks out behind the head.

		MARTY
	What is it?

		UNCLE AL
	A tracer. You'll like it.

		MARTY
	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em
	in the bushes for now.

MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a
line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets
in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out
	for the werewolves!

He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.


EXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now
the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the
downspout and begins working his way down. This should not
be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong
MARTY'S arms are.

His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he
reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple
under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the
back porch.

MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a
tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and
gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the
porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he
looks up at:


EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT

Still a light on up there.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

		MARTY (whispers)
	Shit!

Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:


EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE

MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of
exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of
silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes
and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and
starts moving again.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD

The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily
out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly
along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We
can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns
back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's
not going to be deprived of his treat.


EXT.  MARTY

He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the
starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some
more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary
choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It
cranks, but doesn't start.

MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries
again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few
times, it starts.

		MARTY (softly)
	All right!

He puts it in gear and starts off.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG

What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along
a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.

DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.


EXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT

SOUND: Fast-rushing water.

The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with
picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in
the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER
FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the
bottom.

SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.

MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He
stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of
fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time
selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole
cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a
twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top
and lights the fuse.

When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.

		MARTY (soft)
	Here's one for the good guys!


EXT.  THE TWIZZER

It flies in an arc over the drop.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT

THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of
the waterfall's catch pool.

SOUND: Growling.


EXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half
human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but
its face is in shadow.

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS

It's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back
quickly.

SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA

He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses
and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the
waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it
on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.

The fountain bursts into a shower of light.

		MARTY (delighted)
	All right!


EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

The waterfall is in the b.g.

The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It goes out.


EXT.  MARTY

He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The
Roman candle shoots into the sky.


EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE

Bursts into colored light.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the
sky.


EXT.  MARTY

He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in
the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.

		MARTY
	Is someone there?


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT

It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.


EXT.  MARTY

With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and
sets it on the ground, as before.


EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT

Claw-hands settle over the top.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die
down.


EXT.  MARTY

He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice
when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.


EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it
aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.
Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as
easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a
Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and
advances, hunched over on two legs.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (terrified)
	Who's there?


EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV

The grove is a darkened shadowland.


EXT.  MARTY

He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and
cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,
alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with
terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.


EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV

Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.


EXT.  MARTY

Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor
only cranks. Still no start.


EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET


EXT.  MARTY

He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table
where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the
matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly
drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV

We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much
closer.


EXT.  MARTY

He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same
time.
He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He
puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries
again.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS

He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.

		MARTY (voice; moaning)
	Oh, please...


EXT.  WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING


EXT.  MARTY

He is in an extremity of terror.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU

He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It
lights.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague
shadow.

(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is
not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption
that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,
toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change
at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide
coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this
point, I think we would recognize him.)


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to
the fuse. It splutters alight.


EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT

The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer
flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a
pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at
the WEREWOLF's head.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of
fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.


EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET

The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the
fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the
tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in
fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches
out of its way.


EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping
and weeping with fear.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE

It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from
its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.


EXT.  THE TRACER, CU

It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with
blood.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY

The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of
breath, still deeply frightened.


EXT.  THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF

We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles
through its fingers.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you!
	Reeeal slow!


EXT.  COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY

He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he
has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.


INT.  MARTY'S BEDROOM

His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the
windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto
his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING

SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)


INT.  THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room,
holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND
goes on.

A CLICK as the phone is picked up.

		UNCLE AL (muzzy voice)
	'Lo? Go away.

		MARTY
	It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-


INT.  UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM

Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American
Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side
of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his
skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and
heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.

		UNCLE AL
	You dreamed it, Marty.

		MARTY (voice)
	No! I went out late last night- and-

		UNCLE AL
	There are no such things as werewolves.
	Please, dear boy, have some pity.

He hangs up and falls back into bed.

		GIRL (muzzy voice)
	Whowuzzit?

		UNCLE AL
	Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.


EXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY

He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard.
JANE comes out.

		JANE
	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting
	here all morning.

		MARTY
	Where's Mom?

		JANE
	Went shopping. Why?

		MARTY
	Jane, I have to talk to you.

		JANE (mistrustfully)
	About what?

MARTY looks at her earnestly.

		MARTY
	I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't
	believe me, and if you won't help me, I...
	I...

MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying.

		JANE (concerned)
	Marty, what is it?


EXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE

JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of
beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading
MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the
Medcu unit.

		JANE (voice-over)
	He told me something that was clearly
	unbelievable... and yet, somehow I
	believed most of it. And I understood
	one thing with total clarity: Marty
	himself believed it all.

She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the
door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT

A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and
a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear
bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being
unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane?

		JANE (politely)
	I'm collecting returnable bottles and
	cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer-
	I just wondered if you had any.

Her husband comes up the hall.

		MR. THAYER
	Who is it?

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane Coslaw.


EXT.  JANE

What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.

		JANE
	Hi, Mr. Thayer.


INT.  LON THAYER, ECU

What we see mostly are his brown eyes.

		MR. THAYER
	Hello, Jane.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER

		MRS. THAYER
	Bring your cart around to the back, Jane-
	we'll look in the garage.

		JANE
	Thank you.

She starts down the steps and we


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY

Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing
her cart. Even more bottles in it now.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al
	was thirty-five that summer and I was
	fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe
	the unbelievable, although even then that
	ability is growing rusty, is preparing to
	squeal to a stop.

She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out
front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back
to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around
collar hangs informally on a bush.

		JANE (calls)
	Hi, Father Lowe!

		LOWE (without turning)
	Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!

		JANE
	I'm going to bring in a monster load
	of bottles in an hour or so!

		LOWE (still digging)
	That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.


EXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET

She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart
outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we
see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while
a few men seated at the counter listen.


INT.  JANE, ECU

Wide eyes, mostly.


INT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU

Mostly eyes.


INT.  ROBERTSON'S, FEATURING JANE

As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.


INT.  THE MEN, JANE'S POV

Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others
are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING
THEIR EYES.


EXT.  OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE

She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down
Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.

		JANE (v-o)
	Marty had seen where the tracer had
	struck home, he said, and I went out
	that day doing more than just looking
	for returnable cans and bottles- I was
	looking for a man- or woman- with only
	one eye.


INT.  THE BARBER SHOP  DAY

As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.
Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.
Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial
beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only
one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.

		BILLY
	I know what you're after, Jane, and you're
	out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in
	yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.

		JANE
	Oh... okay.

But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the
man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.


INT.  JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON

		JANE
	That you, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY FAIRTON (muffled)
	No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for
	a shave and a burger.

The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel
away from his eyes. His two eyes.

		JANE (sweetly)
	Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY
	No!

		JANE (just as sweet)
	Oh... okay.

She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she
returns to the door.

		JANE
	'Bye, Mr. McClaren.

		BILLY (amused)
	'Bye, Jane.

		ANDY (muffled)
	Jesus!

JANE goes out.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE RECTORY

She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and
goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She
leaves it there and climbs to the porch.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV

Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe-
or maybe we can't tell.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

She knocks on the screen door.

		JANE
	Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my
	bottles and cans!


INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a
raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood
smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as
you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say),
but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares-
his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.

		JANE (voice)
	Father?

		LOWE
	Take your cart around to the garage
	and unload, Jane! Then bring me your
	tally sheet!


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

		JANE
	Okay!


EXT.  JANE, A WIDER SHOT

She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around
the house.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody
chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.


EXT.  JANE, LOWE'S POV

She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage
and utility shed at the back.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the
meat again.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE SHED-GARAGE

She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE

This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and
cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which
way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload
her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.

SOUND: SQUEAKING.

JANE looks down.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV

A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked
bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.


INT.  JANE

She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,
bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an
overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING
several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then
slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.

JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.


EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY

JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-
her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She
knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It
opens.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?

No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters
the kitchen.


INT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN

She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on
the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down
here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and
into the dark hall.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...

Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.

		LOWE (voice)
	Very good, Jane!

She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:


INT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU

Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered
with a black eye-patch.

		LOWE (grins)
	Good, Jane. Very... very good.

He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it
like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black
patch, which tells her everything.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE

		LOWE (concerned)
	Jane! You're trembling!

		JANE
	I... I don't feel so well, I guess
	maybe I got too much sun.

		LOWE
	Would you like to come in the parlor and
	lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink?
	I have some soda-

		JANE
	No! (softer) That is, I have to get home
	and help my mom with lunch.

		LOWE
	I'll give you a ride!

JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.

		JANE
	No- she... she was going to meet me at the
	market. I'll be fine.


INT.  LOWE, CU

How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell
from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.

		LOWE
	Give my best to your brother, Jane.


INT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY

		JANE
	I will.

She bolts.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY

CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.

		LOWE (soft)
	Real slow.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY

His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.

		MARTY (almost moaning)
	Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?


EXT.  JANE AND MARTY

She's changed into shorts and a blouse.

		JANE
	I ran faster than I ever ran in my life-
	what do you think, dummox? By the time I
	got back here, I really thought I was
	going to faint. (Pause) What are we going
	to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody-
	grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are
	we going to do?

		MARTY (thoughtfully)
	I think I know.


INT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU

A hand- MARTY'S- comes into the frame and prints: I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.


INT.  MARTY'S ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp
focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a
moment, then begins to write again.


INT.  THE NOTEBOOK PAD, CU

He is adding: WHY DON'T YOU KILL YOURSELF?


INT.  MARTY, AT HIS DESK

He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens
a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into
it.


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET

She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox,
opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope
again.


EXT.  THE ENVELOPE, JANE'S POV

Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY
RECTORY; 149 MAIN STREET/TARKER'S MILLS, MAINE.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAILBOX

She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the
fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward
home.


INT.  THE RECTORY LIVING ROOM, WITH LESTER LOWE

He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open
envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the
lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter
hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper
in his fist.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAIN STREET MAILBOX

She drops in another letter and walks away.

		JANE (v-o)
	I mailed another letter for Marty the
	next day... a third the day after that.
	Then, on Saturday...


EXT.  THE TARKER'S MILLS COMMON, LONG

Parked at the curb is UNCLE AL'S sports car.

		JANE (v-o)
	...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.
	(Pause) His reaction was less than serene.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY, ON THE COMMON

		UNCLE AL
	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!

		JANE
	Uncle Al-

		UNCLE AL (to JANE)
	From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think
	his common sense got paralyzed along with
	his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little
	Polly Practical!

		JANE (quiet)
	You don't understand.

		UNCLE AL (wildly)
	Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that
	my niece and nephew are sending the local
	Catholic priest little love notes suggesting
	that he gargle with a broken light bulb or
	eat a rat-poison omelet!

		MARTY
	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's
	wearing an eye-patch!

		UNCLE AL
	I called Peltzer on my way over here,
	Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore
	two days ago for a bottle of otic solution.
	That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's
	got a corneal inflammation.

		MARTY
	Was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	What the hell does that matter?

		MARTY
	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because
	to get a prescription he'd have to see a
	doctor.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!

		MARTY
	Well... was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't know. But I know you didn't see
	any werewolf the other night, Marty. You
	had a dream, that's all. An extremely
	realistic nightmare brought on by what's
	been happening in this town.

		MARTY
	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in
	his shed? You know who used to have a
	baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He
	was so proud of it he used to carry it in
	the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it
	looked like the Green Giant used it for
	a toothpick!

		UNCLE AL
	You want to know what I think?

		MARTY
	No- we just got you out here so we could
	admire your pretty face.

		UNCLE AL
	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a
	hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or
	something.

		JANE (indignant)
	It was not! You want me to show you! Come
	on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!

		UNCLE AL
	No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for
	palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic
	Werewolf.

JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of
	it by now anyway.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OF ROBERTSON'S LUNCHEONETTE

The Silver Bullet stands outside. The door opens and UNCLE
AL, JANE, and MARTY come out. UNCLE AL is carrying MARTY
piggyback. MARTY has an ice cream cone. JANE is holding two.

UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY
starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone.
The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS
THEM.

		JANE
	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb,
	why hasn't he picked up the telephone and
	called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's
	sending poison-pen letters?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his
	letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept
	the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw
	Marty in his wheelchair.

		JANE
	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told
	Constable Haller that someone is sending
	him poison-pen letters?

UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:


EXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV

LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed)
	Well... he probably did. I mean, he could
	make a complaint without taking an ad out
	in the paper, couldn't he?

		MARTY
	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff
	was nonprescription. And I'll bet you
	another quarter he hasn't said anything
	to Mr. Haller.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, do you see your suspect?


EXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE

Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE
waves back.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		MARTY (grim)
	Yes, I see him.

		UNCLE AL
	Do you really think that a man who took
	a rocket in the eye three nights ago
	could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either
	be in the hospital... or dead.

		MARTY
	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot
	him when he was-

		UNCLE AL
	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.
	Jane, you don't really believe this madness,
	do you?

		JANE
	I don't know exactly what I believe. But I
	know that what I saw was a baseball bat and
	not a broomstick. I know there was something
	strange about the way the house smelled that
	day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I
	believe in Marty. I mean- there are times
	when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but
	I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to
	believe in him, too, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he
throws his hands up in disgust.

		UNCLE AL
	Kids!

He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.

She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to
catch up.


EXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY

It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In
the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back
to us in his wheelchair, watching.


EXT.  AN OLD COUPE

It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER
LOWE is behind the wheel.

SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK.


EXT.  LESTER LOWE

		LOWE (quietly)
	Little bastard.


EXT.  A FLY BALL


EXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT

The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward
town.


EXT.  MARTY

The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances
his way.

		OUTFIELDER
	You comin' down to Robertson's for a
	soda, Marty?

		MARTY
	No- I guess I'll go home.

I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression
in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.

		OUTFIELDER
	Okay- seeya!

		MARTY
	Yeah... seeya.

He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

He starts it up.


EXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV

He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the
other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the
road.


EXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV

MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer
to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL

He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.

		LOWE (whispers)
	Bastard.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's
playing center field for the Dodgers.

SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA


EXT.  MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE

MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across
the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way
by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.

LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into
the ditch.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE

		LOWE
	Oh, you bastard!

He floors the engine.


EXT.  THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS

Spinning helplessly in the dirt.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE COUPE

He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever
into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto
the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing
Silver Bullet.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY

He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks
behind.


EXT.  THE COUPE

Roars toward THE CAMERA.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.


EXT.  CHASE MONTAGE

The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple:
LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country
road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a
couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have
him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE
ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers:
ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE
JESUS!

As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is
gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he
looks down at:


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

The needle is all the way over on "E."


EXT.  MARTY

He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.


EXT.  THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET

LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves
from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for
the moment but almost overturning in the process.

They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in
fact.


EXT.  THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE

Now the needle is actually past "E."


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Come on, baby... come on...

His face registers hope as he sees:


EXT.  ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV

AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES
PROHIBITED!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going
for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's
motor COUGHS.


EXT.  THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:
BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow
makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the
Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the
mouth of the covered bridge.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a
halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND
SPLUTTERING.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL

His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become
the face of a gargoyle.


EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET

It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of
the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine
through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.
The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair
sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage
is about seventy feet.

About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last
cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along
silently, going on its dying momentum.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under
the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.


EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE

Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE
CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair
is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:


EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the
sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when
one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal
maniac close behind.


EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE

		LOWE (soft voice)
	Marty...

MARTY'S head whips around.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S
silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of
footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.


INT.  LOWE'S SHOES

Sensible black Oxfords.

		LOWE
	I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if
	you believe that or not, but it's true. I
	would never willingly hurt a child. You
	should have left me alone, Marty.

SOUND of footfalls resumes.


EXT.  MARTY

He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he
wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS

		LOWE (soft; soothing)
	I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our
	religion teaches that suicide is the
	greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.
	Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide;
	if she had done so, she would be burning in
	hell right now. By killing her I took her
	physical life but saved her life eternal.
	You see, Marty? You see how all things serve
	the will and the mind of God? You see, you
	meddling little shit!

He begins to walk forward again.


EXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV

He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not
hurrying.

		LOWE
	You're going to have a terrible accident,
	Marty. You're going to fall into the river.

SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.


EXT.  MARTY

TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER.

MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward:


EXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV

THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER
ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure
spreader which is mostly empty.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (waving madly)
	Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE

He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal
cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile.
Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?


EXT.  ELMER AND MARTY

ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it
around. MARTY looks back at:


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Empty.

SOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT.


EXT.  MARTY AND ELMER

MARTY looks back at ELMER.

		MARTY
	I ran out of gas.

		ELMER
	Spooky in there, ennit?

		MARTY (with feeling)
	It sure is!

He looks back once more toward:


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD  DAY

MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking
croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.

MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls
over.

		UNCLE AL
	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow
	without the hair and the foaming jaws.
	Also, I checked on the otic solution.
	It was counter brand. No prescription
	needed.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		UNCLE AL
	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.

		JANE (sits down)
	Did you talk to the constable?

		UNCLE AL
	After Marty called me with his latest
	Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause)
	He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged
	at all.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		JANE
	Shut up, Marty.

		UNCLE AL (reluctantly)
	There's something else.

	MARTY					JANE
What is it?					What other thing?

		UNCLE AL
	I probably shouldn't tell you- you're
	both hysterical on the subject. I'm
	starting to feel like a guy handing
	out free Arthur Murray coupons to
	victims of the dancing sickness.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-

He makes strangling gestures.

		UNCLE AL (reluctant)
	I went out to that rest area.

		MARTY (triumph)
	You found the tracer?

		UNCLE AL
	No... but I found some blood, smeared on
	a tree trunk in that grove.

		MARTY
	There! You see!

		UNCLE AL
	It could have been anything, Marty.

		MARTY
	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his
	car and trying to run me down? You don't
	think that was a dream, do you?

		UNCLE AL
	No.

UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He
looks down at:


EXT.  THE FRAME OF THE BULLET

There's a scrape and a dent where LOWE'S coupe dented it.
There is also a fleck of paint.


EXT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE, CU

		UNCLE AL
	Lowe's car-?

		JANE
	Blue. This blue.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

Three-quarters full.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE
AL'S sports car is parked out front.


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL

HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands
laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL.
There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it,
UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.

		HALLER
	That's just about the craziest damn story
	I've ever heard, Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I know. I could have edited out all of the
	completely crazy stuff, but I thought you
	deserved to hear it with the bark on.

		HALLER
	I appreciate that. Now, the next question:
	Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?

		UNCLE AL
	Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should
	be checked out.

HALLER rises.

		HALLER
	That can be arranged.

They shake hands.


EXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT

A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the
side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he
does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over
his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's
shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember
them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the
picture. He goes up the walk.

HALLER rings the doorbell.

No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one
comes. He leans down and looks through a side window.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV

No one there.


EXT.  HALLER

He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and
then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and
looks in.


EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV

LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans.


INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER

He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down.
In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda
cans.

HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He
lights it and looks at:


INT.  THE COUPE, CU

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in
the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come
into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE
CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY
has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does
LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.


INT.  HALLER

His eyes widen.

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about
nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum
scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and
werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In
one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.

HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA
CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and
falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy,
but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and
again and again.


EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE
DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.
The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.

		MARTY
	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and
	guess what? No one sees him again!

		UNCLE AL
	And what do you suggest I do about it,
	dear boy?

MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it
to UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	I want you to turn this into a silver
	bullet.

		UNCLE AL
	You're not going to let it go, are you?

		MARTY
	I saw what I saw.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

		JANE (quietly)
	In the made-up stories, the guy who's the
	werewolf only changes when the moon is full.
	But maybe he's really that way almost all
	the time, only as the moon gets fuller...

		MARTY (finishes)
	...the guy gets wolfier.

		JANE (hands AL her crucifix)
	Here. Take mine, too.

		MARTY
	Jane... you don't have to do that.

		JANE
	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I
	don't, booger-brains.

		MARTY
	Will you marry me, Jane?

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy
	Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?

		JANE
	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

		MARTY
	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or
	exactly what it is- but people still
	believe in it.

		UNCLE AL
	The kid is eleven years old and already
	he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

		MARTY
	I think he's going to come for me. Not
	just because I know who he is, but
	because I hurt him. Only I don't think
	he'll try again as Lowe.

		UNCLE AL
	Dear boy, you have gone right out of
	your mind.

		MARTY
	Will you do it?

UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the
wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short
lane and into a gravel pit.

THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can
see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's
bloody and chewed.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY

The wagon pulls in.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Please, Uncle Al.

		JANE
	Will you?

The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from
the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the
medal and looks at it.

		UNCLE AL
	All right. I give up. Yes.

  MARTY							JANE
All right! Thanks!				Thank you, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	If either of you ever tells anyone I even
	bought a piece of this story, werewolves
	will be the least of your problems.


EXT./INT.  SILVER BULLET MONTAGE

a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a
	gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an
	old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard
	of weapons.

b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All
Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,
using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale
is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	God knows what sort of story my uncle
	told him, but I think that for men who
	have been married as often as Uncle Al,
	invention on short notice becomes
	something of a specialty.

c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
	silver content of my crucifix and Marty's
	medallion...

d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S
melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...melted them down...

e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...and molded them into a silver bullet.


INT.  MAC'S GUN SHOP, WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL  DAY

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He
puts it down on the glass counter top.

		MAC
	Here it is.


INT.  THE BOX, CU

MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on
dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a
pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet
optically- not much, just a little- to make it look
absolutely magical. Almost holy.


INT.  MAC AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to
the light.

		MAC
	Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think.
	It's got a low-grain load so it won't
	tumble. Should be pretty accurate.

		UNCLE AL
	It's just a gag, that's all. What would
	you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?

		MAC (joking)
	How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy
	Halloween, Al.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm summer air.

		JANE (voice-over)
	By the time Marty's silver bullet was done,
	it was Halloween... and the full moon had
	come around again. Earlier that afternoon,
	my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer
	for over seven years, finally finished the job.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved
jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door.
UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon
is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway;
MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.

NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has
obviously been crying.

		NAN
	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton
	in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral
	parlor. It's Stickney and-

		UNCLE AL
	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!

The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.

		NAN
	And don't open the door for any trick or
	treaters even if they come!

		UNCLE AL
	We won't!

The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out
again.

		NAN
	You kids go to bed on time! You've got
	school tomorrow!

		UNCLE AL
	If you keep doing that, you're going to
	bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama-
	tell her I'll see her Thursday.

		NAN
	I will- be good, kids.

  MARTY							JANE
'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!				We will! 'Bye!

The station wagon accelerates away.

		UNCLE AL
	Can I tell you kids something?

		JANE
	Sure, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	When me and sissy were kids, we were
	just like you two.

		MARTY
	Yeah? Really?

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still
	are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

He ushers them inside and closes the door.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN

		BOB
	I can't believe that you'd agree to leave
	the kids with him. A year ago I would have
	laughed at the idea. You used to almost
	breathe fire when Al came in the house.

		NAN
	He's changed. Just this summer. Or
	something's changed him. Marty, maybe.
	And the drinking- I think it's almost
	stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful.
	And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure
	of it.

		BOB
	I know they'll be safe with him... but will
	he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?

		NAN (firmly)
	If I told him to, he will.


INT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

It reads 1:00.

SOUND: The National Anthem.


INT.  THE TV, CU

The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card.

		ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	This concludes WDML's broadcast day.

The TV goes to snow.


INT.  JANE ON THE COUCH

She's mostly asleep in one corner.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's also dozing.


INT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV

He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans
in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is
smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his
lap.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE

The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side
yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of
the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom).


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-
it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this,
its one eye flaring.

DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to
his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.

MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its
jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS
GROW LOUDER.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY

UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette
out of his lap and puts it out.

		JANE (sleepy)
	You'll burn yourself up sometime doing
	that, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

		MARTY
	But Uncle Al! You said-

		UNCLE AL
	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten
	past one. He's not coming.

		JANE
	The moon's not down yet...

		UNCLE AL
	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this
	stupid gun in my lap because I promised,
	but you two are going to bed. Go on,
	now, scoot.

JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.

		MARTY
	What if I say no?

		UNCLE AL
	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.
	(more kindly) Go on, now.

MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs,
where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the
living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and
stops.

		MARTY
	If that'd gone off, it would have been the
	end of our silver bullet.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down
and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five
chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet
into his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.

Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its
green eye flaring.


INT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is
looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.

		JANE (shrieking)
	It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!
	IT'S THE WEREWOLF!

She's pointing at the window.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL
has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the
silver bullet loosely held in the other.

Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to
the kids.

		UNCLE AL (sharply)
	You see it, Marty!


INT.  MARTY

		MARTY (shakes his head)
	I was looking at you...


INT.  UNCLE AL

His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare
is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're
just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is
actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!

		UNCLE AL
	A very familiar feeling is beginning to
	creep over me.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

JANE is crying.

		MARTY
	What's that, Uncle Al?


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	I feel like a horse's ass.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

		JANE (weeping)
	I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!

MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a
comforting arm around her shoulder.

		JANE
	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!

		MARTY
	Jane-


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids go to bed? My head's
	starting to ache.


EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, ECU

We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close
around a thick wire.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	Reeeal slow...

It yanks.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

The lights go out.

JANE SHRIEKS.

		MARTY
	It's here! It's outside!


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Jane, it's just a power fai-

He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall-
not just the window it was looking through before but the
whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way
through, roaring.

UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire-
but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are
empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF
smashes him aside.


INT.  UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE

He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver
bullet another.


INT.  THE GUN

It spins into a living-room corner.


INT.  THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION

We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes
down, hits the floor, and rolls.


INT.  THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION

In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling
toward it.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE

		MARTY
	Get the gun!

He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into
the hall.


INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION

The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In
the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.

He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.

His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in
the heating vent.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his
shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the
pistol.

The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through
the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and
hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward
her.


INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Comes toward her.


INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER

She makes as if to run one way.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is
toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.


INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU

A bloodstained hand grabs a poker.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE

As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and
strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.

UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.

It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it
aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that
now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.


INT.  JANE

She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward
the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Its head whips around.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille
off. One arm is down inside.

		MARTY (scream)
	Janey! The gun! THE GUN!


INT.  JANE

She tosses it awkwardly.


INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION

It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,
awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

		WEREWOLF (snarls)
	Maa-aaa-rty...

It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing
things out of its way.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the
heating duct again...


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping
fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an
inch out of reach.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF (foaming)
	Maaa-aaa-rty...


INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR

		JANE (sobbing)
	Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!

She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back
into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this
is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't
have to pay for.

		WEREWOLF
	Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-


INT.  MARTY, CU

He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the
approaching WEREWOLF.


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet
blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the
cylinder closed.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!


INT.  MARTY

He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a
click. An expression of dismay on his face.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Kill you...


INT.  MARTY

He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.
He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The
Bullet hits the wall.


INT.  MARTY

Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a
third time. Click!

The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.


INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!

It bends down, reaching.


INT.  MARTY, ECU

Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls
the trigger again.


INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE

The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He
flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and
crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits
there, roaring... and then it begins to change.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE

She lies there, sobbing.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	You okay, Janey?


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps
JANE up.

		JANE
	I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU

Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;
it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.

It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.


INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR

		MARTY (calls)
	I'm all right. He's dead.


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in
the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying
on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...
and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at
her.

She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really
dead. I think. Until the sequel.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY

UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing
again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and
draws her down beside himself and MARTY.

		UNCLE AL (to MARTY)
	There. I told you there weren't any such
	things as werewolves.

They smile at each other with love.

		JANE (nervous)
	Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or
	whatever it is?

		UNCLE AL
	If it isn't now, it will be after I pound
	one of your mother's silver candlesticks
	through its heart.

		JANE (grimaces)
	Oh Uncle Al, no!

		UNCLE AL (grim)
	Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I
	believe it all the way.

He gets up and leaves.

		JANE
	Are you all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

		JANE
	You're a real booger, you know it?

		MARTY (smiles)
	I love you, Jane.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG  NIGHT

Quiet. Sleeping.

		JANE (voice-over)
	It wasn't always easy for me to answer
	that... but I could answer it that night,
	and I find I can say it now that the
	terrible events of that fall have receded
	to memories which seem little more than
	dreams in my mind.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (hugging him)
	I love you, Marty.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG

		JANE (voice-over; no more than a whisper)
	I love you, Marty... good night.

THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.

					FADE OUT.
FADE IN:


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm late summer air.

SOUND: Crickets.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:


EXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT

CREDITS BEGIN.

A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is
ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino
pants. He is drinking beer.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...

He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses
it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.

ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox
on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He
shines it on the switch.

He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a
pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also
gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back
pocket.

ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT

He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the
light on the switch for a moment. During this:

		ARNIE (sings)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat, won't you try, won't you
	buy Rheingold beer...

He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.

		ARNIE
	Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!

He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and
drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then
he picks up his crowbar.

CREDITS CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -
something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is
a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes
still hang from it.

What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as
wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we
should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick
ourselves for not knowing earlier.

It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on
the whole rail-rider.

CREDITS CONCLUDE.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as
hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly,
both the tracks and the switch move.

		ARNIE
	Hot damn! Now... a little oil...

He turns back toward the rail-rider.


EXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

		ARNIE
	It's not bitter, not sweet... it's
	a big fuckin' treat...

A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling.
ARNIE looks around.


EXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of
his tools.


EXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching
point.


EXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT

A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws
on that hand.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT

Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is
still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow.
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy
Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.


EXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the
long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving
the can.

		ARNIE (sings)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...

He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.


EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of
course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,
half wolf, half human.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see
what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is
in extremely deep shit.

SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF  NIGHT

It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow
green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.


EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of
horror.

		ARNIE
	Oh n-

A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is
granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his
body.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand
reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.
The hand is dripping blood.

It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.

The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible
grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.

		WEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...

No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the
bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams
out.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW  NIGHT

He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth
and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU  NIGHT

The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins
to eat the bottle.

Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in
pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.

Looks up. It HOWLS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS  NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might
be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be
1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time
moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and
forth. No one is in a hurry.

We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);
Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett
neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see
the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.
We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia
Loren in "Two Women."
It's Our Town, U.S.A.

		JANE (voice-over)
	This place is Tarker's Mills, where I
	grew up... and this is how it was when I
	was fourteen - a place where people cared
	about each other as much as they cared
	about themselves. This is how my town
	looked as, all unknowing, it approached the
	rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.

SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.


EXT./INT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a
car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.
b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.
They both look around.
c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at
the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.


EXT.  THE SETTING MOON, CU  NIGHT

As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.

		JANE (v-o)
	The killing had begun, but at first no
	one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic
	drunk, and what happened seemed like an
	accident.


EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY  NIGHT

Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO
DAWN.

SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.

CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There
is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of
ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.

SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.

		JANE (v-o)
	The county coroner concluded that Arnie
	passed out on the tracks. There wasn't
	enough evidence to conclude anything else.

And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn
blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears
underneath. We see something flopping and moving under
there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON  DAY

The common is more or less in the center of town, either
surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on
the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but
the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE
TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!

Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been
set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked
breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit
down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are
tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.

		JOE HALLER (amplified voice)
	I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,
	of Holy Family Catholic Church!

Enthusiastic applause greets this.


INT.  THE CROWD  DAY

Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're
looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her
husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It
is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard
speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has
been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she
leans toward her mother.

		JANE
	I'm going out for a while, 'kay?

		NAN
	All right. Stay close. And make sure your
	brother's all right.

As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.

NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue
to wear it through the whole movie.


INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY

To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.
It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency
medical unit.

Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in
one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and
beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning
to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the
applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years...

No amplification. He taps the mike.


INT.  JANE

She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people
should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of
about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.

		GIRL (mocking)
	"Make sure your brother's all right."

		JANE (low)
	Marty's a booger.

She reaches the aisle and starts out.


INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE

He taps the mike again.


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW

		BOB (good-natured)
	Just pretend you're in your own church
	askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!

Good-natured laughter greets this.


INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM

A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF
SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.

		LOWE
	For the last ten years, I have had a
	dream. A dream of a time when modern
	medical care would come to this small
	community, which sometimes seems so far
	from Durham, with her lifesaving
	hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at
	which I see so many of my friends
	gathered, will be the start of making my
	dream come true.

SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.


EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU

It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling
through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF
APPLAUSE.

		MARTY (voice)
	Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're
	not poisonous?

		BRADY (voice)
	Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -
grab the blacksnake.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU

BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with
respectful wonder.

NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,
and will through the whole movie.

		MARTY
	Lemme hold him!

BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY
sees:


EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY

		JANE (v-o)
	I was almost fifteen that summer. My
	brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his
	friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I
	had to bear. Brady was actually the worse
	of the two, but I was rarely disposed to
	see that. Not when my younger brother was
	so constantly thrown in my face by my
	parents.

		LOWE (v-o from the tent)
	$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you
	think of the lives this unit might save, it
	seems very inexpensive indeed.

Applause greets this.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from
waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.

		BRADY
	I got an idea.

		MARTY
	What?

BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes
widen.

		MARTY
	You wouldn't.

BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.

		MARTY
	You would.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE

		LOWE
	An endeavor like this seems to me to be
	the very definition of community - all
	of us pulling together as one, farmers
	and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...


EXT.  JANE

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing
under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.

		BRADY (teasing voice)
	Jane... Jane...

She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost
touching her upturned face.

JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over
her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a
nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose
shredded at the knees.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing
wildly.


EXT.  JANE

She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's
near tears.


EXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT

The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part
of this little stunt, as he ought to be.

		MARTY
	It was just a blacksnake, Jane-


EXT.  JANE

She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and
something very close to hate.

		JANE
	Look at my knees! Look at my dress!
	I hate you!


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her
	teddies?


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Stop it, Brady.


EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

He throws the snake.


EXT.  JANE

She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning
to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.


EXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE

		BRADY
	Ooooh, naughty!


EXT.  MARTY

He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural
in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for
the time being we must be puzzled.

		MARTY
	Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We
	didn't mean-

He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.

		JANE
	Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,
	you booger!

She runs away.


EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He swings down and comes over to MARTY.

		BRADY (with satisfaction)
	Really got her goat that time.


EXT.  MARTY

He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.

		MARTY
	Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.


EXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY

She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she
steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt
of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.

		STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)
	Wait! Don't go!

Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress
down. No one in sight.

		MAN (voice; rough)
	Just leave me alone!

Now she looks toward:


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV

A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who
has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about
the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the
bandstand.

STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to
the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -
but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara
Falls.

		STELLA (calls)
	Please! You have to help me!


EXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER

		DECEIVER (keeps walking)
	It's your oven, but it ain't my bun
	you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.

B.g. SOUNDS: More applause.


EXT.  JANE

We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the
bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.
JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in
this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the
stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose
absently in a litter can.

JANE mounts the steps timidly.

		JANE
	Stella? Is that you?


EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is
bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she
is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the
sound of JANE's voice.

		STELLA (alarmed)
	Who - ?

		JANE (approaching closer)
	It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.

STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.
JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she
approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.

		JANE (tenderly)
	What's wrong?

		STELLA (weeping)
	He's going away. I know he is.

		JANE
	Who's going away?

STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.

		STELLA
	What am I going to tell my mother? If
	he won't marry me, what am I going to
	tell my mother?

		JANE (bewildered)
	Stella, I don't know what-

		STELLA
	Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me
	alone, you stupid thing!

STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE
stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little
frightened.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION

		O'BANION
	Let us pray.


INT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING

Most of them bow their heads.


INT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM

		O'BANION
	May the Grace of God shine upon those
	gathered here... and lift them up... and
	grant success to the endeavor to which
	they have so openheartedly declared their
	support. Amen.


INT.  THE GATHERING

They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross
themselves.


EXT.  THE PICNIC AREA

People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down.


EXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

Traveling along a country road. Headed home.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are
in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.
She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.

MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the
wagon.

NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE
she's mad at.

		NAN
	I want you two to bury the hatchet.
	You're being very silly, Jane.

		JANE (hot)
	Did you see my knees?

		MARTY
	Jane, I-

		NAN
	I think you're being mean as well as
	silly. Your brother has never had a
	scraped knee in his whole life.

Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against
her brother and the source of most of the tension in the
COSLAW family.

MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this
always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how
to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.

		JANE
	You always take his side because he's a
	cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's
	a cripple!

		MARTY
	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I
	couldn't stop him.

		JANE
	Brady's a booger and so are you!

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

		BOB (roars)
	Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of
	you out!

In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of
Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains
thundery.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

Train tracks run near the road.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY

		BOB (points)
	That's where poor old Arnie Westrum
	pitched his last drunk.

He crosses himself and they all look toward:


EXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV)


INT.  THE CAR  DAY

		BOB
	They had to pick up what was left of
	him in a peach basket.

		JANE
	Oh, Daddy! Gross!

		MARTY
	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?
	That's what Brady said.

		JANE
	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit.
	I mean it.

		NAN (no sympathy)
	You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I
	think we've all had quite enough of this
	horror-movie talk.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER  DAY

Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust.
His face is thoughtful, solemn.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls
on her unhappy face as the door is opened.

		MARTY (v-o)
	Janey?... Are you awake?

JANE says nothing.


INT.  THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY  NIGHT

He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he
was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get
a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A
box, for sure.

		MARTY
	Can I come in?


INT.  JANE

Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the
wall.


INT.  MARTY

He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night
table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over
and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can
of mixed nuts.

		JANE
	What's the money for?

		MARTY
	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

		JANE
	I don't want your money. You're a booger.

		MARTY
	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God.
	Please take the money. I want to make up.

She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite.
She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.

		JANE
	I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the
	pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.

She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She
picks it up, curious.

		MARTY
	That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it
	to me-

		JANE (scorn)
	That drunk!

		MARTY
	-but I want you to have it.

He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother
is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has
been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly
at him.

		MARTY
	Yeah, go ahead.

She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring
inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.

		JANE
	You booger!

MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.

		MARTY (grinning)
	It really is for your birthday, though -
	try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.

		JANE
	Go to hell!


INT.  MARTY, BY THE DOOR

		MARTY (smiling)
	I love you, Janey.


INT.  JANE, IN BED

She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a
response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL
evoke). She smiles at him a little.


INT.  MARTY

He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and
leaves.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON  NIGHT

We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.

SOUND: A HOWL.


EXT.  A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY

There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also
downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.

An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.

SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE

STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.


INT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU

A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her
vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the
mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.

[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the
window!]

There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the
vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty
prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture.
We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also
a large glass of water on the vanity table.

STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but
probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills,
starts to lift them to her mouth-

A HOWL outside... closer.

STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with
some water. She pauses, looking at herself.

		STELLA
	Suicides go to hell. Especially if
	they're pregnant. And I don't even care.

She takes another five pills. And another five.

SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.


EXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT

Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse,
guttural breathing.


INT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE

She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind
her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the
werewolf throws itself through.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

She sits up, startled awake.

From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A
SCREAM.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA

She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of
her nightgown.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

		MOTHER
	Oh my dear God... Stella!

She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a
confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering
glass.


INT.  STELLA'S BED, CU

One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping
through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.

Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.


EXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE

The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.

SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL.


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER

She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it
gamely along.

		MOTHER
	Stella!...Stella!

She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates
there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.

A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


INT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU

She shrieks again.


INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE

It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the
mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is
broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy
wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.

STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around
her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure
isn't what happened.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING

a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the
"Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The
scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can
see STELLA'S photograph.
b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see
the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a
bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER,
VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer
we'll meet later.
c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big
hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON
SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY!
d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out
and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the
parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.


EXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET

The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE.


INT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL

Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY.
And below this: JOSEPH HALLER.

		JOE HALLER (voice)
	Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER

HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks
like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy
deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly
found himself batting in the World Series.

		PETE
	What'd they say, Joe?

		HALLER
	They said they'd be here by noon.

		PETE (nervous)
	Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling
	that Smokey Bear from the Detective
	Division to fuck off, Joe.

		HALLER (morosely)
	I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a
	mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's
	go on out there.

He gets slowly up.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL  AFTERNOON

It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy
climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along
one side of the building.

SOUND: The bell rings.

A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids
spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they
are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids
book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes
and riding or just running.

Everyone has a pink report card.


EXT.  A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY
STURMFULLER

BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of
a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver
Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.
Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing
car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with
a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright
metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.
Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have
thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER
BULLET.

		BRADY
	Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and
	the Silver Bullet!

TAMMY laughs.

		BRADY
	You glad to be back in jail, Marty?

		MARTY
	Sure - I like school.

		TAMMY
	You booger.

		MARTY
	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty
	soon I'm going to start checking the
	mirror to see if I'm turning green.

		BRADY
	I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.


EXT.  THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WALNUT, A WIDER SHOT  AFTERNOON

TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his
bike.
MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He
bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by
side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY FROM THE FAR CURB, REVERSE

He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the
little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!

		MARTY
	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the
	regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.

		TAMMY
	What's that?

		MARTY
	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime
	this summer and we'd soup up the engine...
	but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and
	he's in the doghouse with my mother.

		TAMMY
	For getting a divorce?

		MARTY
	Well... it is his third.


EXT.  A STREET ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, WITH MARTY AND
TAMMY

The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has
ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road.
They look toward:


EXT.  THE RANDOLPH HOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the
stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled
with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of
state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.

We can see a large black wreath on the door.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		TAMMY
	Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was
	scared to go past her house by myself.

		MARTY (matter-of-fact)
	Yeah... it is a little scary.

		TAMMY
	I mean, I saw her. All the time.

TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.

		TAMMY
	I used to see her every day, and she never
	knew what was going to happen to her, and
	neither did I! I mean I know how stupid
	that sounds, but...

		MARTY
	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.

He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal
along to catch up.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

They stop at the end.

		TAMMY
	There's something else scary.

		MARTY
	What?

		TAMMY (points)
	That.


EXT.  OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place.
Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many
- have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle
of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a
mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She is quite deeply troubled.

		TAMMY
	I've been hearing noises in there.

		MARTY
	What kind of noises?

		TAMMY
	Rattling. Rustling.

		MARTY
	Rats...

		TAMMY
	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not
	rats and it's not kids. It's-


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT

Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic
for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of
pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap
with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of
beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold
the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching
his crotch.

		MILT
	Tammy, you get on in here and do some
	dishes!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE

Sinister...spooky.

		TAMMY (voice)
	I've got to go.


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'd go out and take a look myself, but I
	think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden.
	It looks sorta greasy.

She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth.
MARTY is stunned... but happy.

		TAMMY
	You would, wouldn't you?

		MARTY (Joe Cool)
	Sure. No sweat.

		TAMMY
	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked
	since... you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises,
	tell your father. Okay?

		TAMMY
	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,
	Marty?

		MARTY (Startled)
	Jeez!


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV

There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."


EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

		MARTY
	I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.

		MILT (voice)
	TAMMY!

		TAMMY (calls)
	Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks
	again for coming home with me.

She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors
back onto the street and turns toward town.


EXT.  TAMMY

She brings her bike to a stop by her father.

		MILT
	'Bout time. Why you want to hang around
	that cripple?

		TAMMY
	I like him.

		MILT
	Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.
	Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance
	the fucking budget.

Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now
scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward
THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.


EXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW


			DISSOLVES TO:


EXT.  MARTY

He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some
distance away - but at least he's made it back to the
sidewalk again.

		MARTY (prayerfully)
	Come on, baby-

He looks down at:


EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

Now the needle is lying all the way over on "E."


EXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON

MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug
and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the
island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS
comes over.

		VIRGIL
	Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!

		MARTY
	Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?

		VIRGIL
	Want me to check the oil?

		MARTY
	Sure!

		VIRGIL
	Wipe the windshield an check the driver's
	bullshit level?

MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the
Silver Bullet's small tank.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you
	a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a
	Rod Carew.


INT.  THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW  NIGHT

She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she
just bit into a lemon.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's
thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got
both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with
butts.

He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball
cards. Each has a pile in front of him.

MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he
looks at him.

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. I call.

He tosses in three baseball cards.

		UNCLE AL
	Wait a minute, wait a minute!

He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it
back.

		UNCLE AL
	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager!
	Stone the crows!

		MARTY
	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

		UNCLE AL
	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.

He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.


INT.  THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE

NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She
favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at
MARTY.

		NAN
	Come on, Marty- bedtime.

She starts to wheel him away.

		MARTY
	Mom-!

		UNCLE AL
	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back
to the table.

		NAN
	Make it quick.

UNCLE AL lays down his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	Three kings.

		MARTY (delighted)
	I got a straight to the queen!

		UNCLE AL
	Bullshit luck!

		NAN (outraged)
	That's enough!

		MARTY (as his mother wheels him away)
	Aww, Mom-!


INT.  THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME

MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the
second floor. He looks dejected and glum.

SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can
make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women
like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian
household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even
bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.

A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is
no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by
arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY
hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down
the hall toward the bathroom.

Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.


INT.  THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I
mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another
is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile
of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the
table bending down to pick them up.

		NAN
	I don't want you drinking around Marty.
	That's too much. If you can't stop it,
	you better stay away.

AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this
man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal
drunkenness so we can see it.

		UNCLE AL
	I come here because Marty needs a friend.

		NAN
	Yes... you've always been that to him.
	But if you can't leave your booze in
	whatever dump you call home, you better
	just stay away.

She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after
her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering
ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire
but creating something that looks even worse. He begins
drunkenly picking up again.

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's
	house! Heeyyy!


INT.  THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM

MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.

JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.

		MARTY
	Mom was really mad at him this time,
	wasn't she?

		JANE
	What do you expect, when he comes in
	smelling like a brewery and looking like
	an unmade bed?

		MARTY
	Stop it!

He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY
overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush
clatters across the tile.

		BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice)
	Hey! That you, Marty?

		JANE
	He's okay, Dad!

She looks around swiftly, then bends down.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT

One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes
are shut. He's weeping.

		JANE (low)
	Marty, are you all right?

		MARTY
	Yes. Go away.

		JANE
	Let me help you up.

		NAN (voice)
	Marty?

SOUND of her climbing the stairs.

JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then
helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink
counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please
don't tell on me," it says.

NAN comes in.

		NAN
	Jane, have you been teasing your
	brother again?

		MARTY
	She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush
	and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane
	helped pick me up.

He bats his eyes at her.

		MARTY (syrupy voice)
	Jane's wunnnderful.

JANE picks up his toothbrush.

		JANE (hands it to him)
	Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that
	shit in your head might leak down into your
	mouth and poison you.

		NAN
	Jane Coslaw!

But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good
put-down.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT

We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to
pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She's deeply asleep.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door
closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from
the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer
pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer
in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.

		MILT (drunk)
	Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something-
one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and
SHATTERS.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT

He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on
the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.

		MILT (all eyes again)
	Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER

A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.


INT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM

Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks
out.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)

SOUND of another crash. Plants move.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT

He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks
inside.

		MILT
	Let's see if you want to come back and
	break my pots all to shit after I put
	some rock salt in your asses!


INT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding
the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is
really overgrown.

MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the
director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense.
I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe
even a big plump spider- will land on him.

He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.

		MILT (shouts)
	Who's there?


INT.  GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV  NIGHT

A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have
pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).


INT.  MILT  NIGHT

He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to
happen, but it keeps not happening.

Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big,
hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two
of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-
and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.

SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.

MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it
is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is
pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only
from the knees up.


INT.  TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM

She sits up in bed.

SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.

MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in
rollers, comes into Tammy's room.

		MRS. STURMFULLER
	Tammy, where's your father?

SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.


INT.  THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT

He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by
broken, splintered boards.

SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.

He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from
the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning,
splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over
it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.

A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked
all the way into the hole, board and all.


EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.


INT.  TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER

They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG  DAY

The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As
we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER
are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas
bags.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER

He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the
bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3  DUSK

a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home,
obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and
nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the
endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she
lurches inside and slams the door.
b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER
O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them.
c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some
plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him,
the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him
in.
d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an
automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a
pugnacious, unpleasant look.
e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber
shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to
make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I
guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE
CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's,
where he also goes in.
f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The
"Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS
SECOND VICTIM.


EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID  MAGIC HOUR

They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the
b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as
he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on
Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.

In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL)
WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at
the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.

Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER
ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at
the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY
McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER
LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing
a beer and listening closely to the conversation.

		ELMER (to VIRGIL)
	Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man
	up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!

		VIRGIL
	But the woman's bed was ripped right down
	the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to
	do something like that!

		PORTER
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter. (To VIRGIL) What about the
	tracks?

ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.

		VIRGIL
	That could be something to throw off the
	cops. And it ain't animals that try to
	confues the law; it's people do that.

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Law around here don't need much confusing.

PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and
ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.

		ANDY (deep disgust)
	Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if
	someone rammed it full of radium and gave
	him a Geiger counter.

		PETE SYLVESTER (comes over)
	Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd
	over getting fined two hundred bucks for
	that little fender bender out on the Ridge
	Road last year.

		ANDY
	Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to
	take care of his mouth before someone comes
	along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe
	Haller's salary to keep the people in this
	town safe, and he ain't doing it.


INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR

He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.

		BILLY (mildly)
	Last town report said you was in arrears
	your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid
	up, huh?


INT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY
	What are you, trying to be smart?

OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.

		OWEN
	You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm
	gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?

		ANDY (sulks)
	Bring me a Schlitz.


EXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK

SOUND of panting.

MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms.
His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply
behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch,
untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.

		MARTY (calls)
	Here it comes!


EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY

		BRADY
	Drop it!

As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.

		JANE
	Marty Coslaw, you get down out of
	that tree!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE

He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.

		MARTY
	Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (makes no immediate move to do so)
	Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.

		MARTY (hanging)
	Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?

		JANE
	They both are. At me, for not getting you
	sooner. I ought to let you fall.

But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He
pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.


EXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK

		MARTY (voice)
	Hey, Brady! You coming?

		BRADY (looking into the sky)
	In a while!

BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves
vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks
in Marin County might say.


EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.

		JANE
	Come on, Marty.

She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and
looks at:


EXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the
bluish-purple sky.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK

The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of
LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have
appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR.
ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A
barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.

Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair
amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's
more belligerent than ever.

		ANDY (holding forth)
	This whole investigation has been as
	efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-

		PETE (bravely)
	I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If
	you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to
	shut it for you.


INT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE

It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes
in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.


INT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE

		ANDY (astounded)
	What did you say?


INT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER

		OWEN
	Jesus wept.

He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat.
Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically
toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries
around the bar with it.


INT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP

PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face
trembling with determination.

		PETE
	You heard what I said, motormouth.

ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a
brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table.
HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems
of his own.


INT.  HERB KINCAID

He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't
like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the
imperatives of the situation demand it right now.

		HERB (quite loudly)
	Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?


INT.  THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE

Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE
freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing
statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and
PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.


EXT.  THE TOWN COMMON, LONG

Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer
moon is rising over the horizon.

SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the
door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright
overlies each face.

NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.


INT.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL

JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry,
letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun
belt.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND

BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the
steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face
grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

		HERB
	Brady!

He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.

		HERB
	Get out of my way!

He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE
and several of the others.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND  NIGHT

		JOE HALLER (low voice)
	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
	thee. Blessed art thou among women...

He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his
side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of
his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down
two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S
smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at
nothing.

		HALLER (low)
	...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.
	Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
	us sinners now...now...

He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over
his face and starts to cry.


EXT.  THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET  NIGHT

A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a
few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID
is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.

SOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID

As HERB KINCAID approaches.

		HALLER
	Stay off the bandstand, Herb.

		HERB
	Is it my boy? Is it Brady?

		HALLER
	Don't go up-

		HERB (lunges past him)
	Brady! Brady!

Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.

		HERB
	Br-(CUTS OFF)

The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look
up.

		PETE
	Joe, is it-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh.

		PETE
	Is it the Kicaid b-

		HALLER (not looking up)
	Shhh, I said.

The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON
shoves forward.

		ANDY
	What the fuck is going on h-

SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men
flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness
on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back
further, looking more uneasy than ever.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	We'll bury his shoes.

Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.

		HERB (voice; laughing)
	That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury
	his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan
	cigar boxes.


EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV  NIGHT

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his
son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.

		HERB
	We'll bury his shoes because his feet are
	still in them and they're the only part of
	him that makes sense anymore.

HERB laughs harder.

		HERB
	It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this
	town ever saw!

HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON
BRADY'S KITE.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

SOUND: HERB SCREAMING.


				DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In
The Sheaves."

There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but
there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG.
MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.

		JANE (v-o)
	My mother and father- my mother in
	particular- did not much care for Uncle
	Al...


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the
mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ.
BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course.
There are lots of flowers.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...but when it came to such unpleasant
	duties as taking Marty to the funeral
	of his best friend...


INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW

As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,
TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.

UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his
hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the
word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He
pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...they didn't at all mind drafting him.
	As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may
	have been able to offer him...

UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him
questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at
TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking
away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers
her the flask. Her eyes widen.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...I now believe that was best kept between
	the two of them...

After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask
and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,
who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her
mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL
smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as
if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER
looks distractedly back toward the service.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...or among the three of them.

UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.


INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. There
	will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid
	this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word
	of comfort to you, if I could.

He looks out at them.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION

They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in
understanding this awful thing.


INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN

		LOWE
	If there is any word of comfort I can give
	you, it's just this: the face of the beast
	always becomes known; the time of the beast
	always passes.

He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.

		LOWE
	If there are times when we feel alone and
	afraid, only small creatures in the dark,
	then these are the times when we must turn
	to one another for our comfort and our hope.
	To our neighbors. To our community. To our
	love for each other. I alone cannot ease
	the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can
	I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if
	I believe anything it's this: we can comfort
	each other. We can heal each other. We can
	go on together.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she
puts her head on his shoulder.


INT.  FATHER LOWE

		LOWE
	The Bible tells us not to fear the terror
	that creepeth by night or that which flieth
	by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because
	there is much we don't know, and we feel
	very small. But we must not be alone. We must
	not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is
	the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to
	each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try
	to remember that the face of the beast always
	becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast
	always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.


EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY

MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins
to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would
think- and she and MARTY embrace.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU

He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY
home.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	You all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	Yeah.

		UNCLE AL
	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than
	a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You
	ever hear that one?

		MARTY
	No.

		UNCLE AL
	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They
	better get the guy.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?

		UNCLE AL
	Huh?

		MARTY
	What if it's some kind of monster?

		UNCLE AL (laughs)
	Jesus, Marty! Come off it!


EXT.  UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET

It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front,
but there are also lots of pickup trucks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?

		UNCLE AL
	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend
	they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't
	anybody ever tell you that the only monsters
	are in comic books and drive-in movies?


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  LATE AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in
	that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a
	big animal. Her father was killed that night.

UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost
believing. Then he shakes his head.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, you have to get this idea out of
	your head. Psychotics are more active
	when the moon is full, and this guy is a
	psycho. He's going to turn out to be as
	human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of
	speaking. Now let's get you inside.

He opens his door and gets out.


INT.  MARTY, CLOSER

He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE AFTERNOON

		ANDY FAIRTON
	Okay, you all know what group you're in and
	what area you'll be covering, right?

		PORTER ZINNEMAN
	Damn straight!

		ELMER ZINNEMAN
	Shut up, Porter.

The men are all dressed in hunting clothes-
red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all
have guns. Among their number are a few women as well,
looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've
met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply
troubled.

ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his
vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho
football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they
really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for
the Gipper.

		ANDY
	Groups one through four are in the woods
	north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and
	six west of Carson Creek.

The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE
HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much
from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort
of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to
explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie
and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has
seriously weakened his authority.

		ANDY (continuing)
	Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.

Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and
PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up
next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.

		ANDY (continuing)
	If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight
	tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.


INT.  THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER

		PORTER (happily)
	Damn straight!

		ELMER
	Shut up, Porter.


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not
	each other. So look before you-


INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER

		HALLER
	I want all of you folks to go home!

A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit,
and turns to face them.

		HALLER
	I can't remember deputizing a single one
	of you!


INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

		ANDY
	That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is
	that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one
	of you has done a damn thing about solving
	this case.

There is a mutter of agreement.


INT.  A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER

ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.
we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing
a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).

		HALLER (without much force)
	We'll catch him.

		ANDY
	You couldn't catch a cold.

HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the
crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we
see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER
speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.

		HALLER
	The law has a name for what you men are
	planning. It's private justice, and private
	justice is about a step and a half away
	from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no
	J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's
	Mills, and I want you men to go home.

They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is
getting to them.

		ANDY
	Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done
	since this thing started but hang his face out?

It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both
ANDY and themselves.

		ANDY (louder)
	He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!

		OWEN KNOPFLER
	Ah, shut up, Andy.

		ANDY
	Don't tell me to-

HERB KINCAID steps forward.

		HERB
	Yes. Correct. Shut up.

ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks
grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.

		HERB (quietly)
	I just came from my boy's funeral.

		HALLER
	Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken
	you must be...but-

		HERB (quietly)
	He was torn apart.

Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,
rapt.

		HALLER
	Yes. Yes, but-

		HERB (still quiet)
	Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.
	Constable, you don't know what those words
	mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!

HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his
face.

		HERB
	My son was torn to pieces!
		(turning back to HALLER)
	You come in here and talk to these men
	about private justice. You dare to do that.
	Constable Haller, why don't you go out to
	Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady
	and explain to him about private justice.
	Would you want to do that?

HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.

		HERB
	No. I thought not.
		(to the others)
	You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't
	ask anyone to do anything that runs counter
	to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out
	and hunt up a little private justice.

ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at
the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other
men start to follow.


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB

Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and
pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing
out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some
high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood
is up.


INT.  OWEN'S PUB

LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his
way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.
He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.

		LOWE
	Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...

		BILLY (not looking at LOWE)
	Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.

He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says
he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER
ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of
others with mounting desperation.

HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and
draws him aside.

		HALLER
	Let them go.

		LOWE
	But-

		HALLER
	This is that spirit of community you were
	talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll
	shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can
	mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit
	the Medcu van, of course.

HALLER laughs.

		LOWE
	But can't we do anything?

OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one
shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the
peacemaker bat.

		HALLER
	Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them
	get killed.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S

More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford
"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing
impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and
BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman
named MAGGIE ANDREWS.

OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.

		ANDY
	Well, it's about frigging time! They'll
	have his hide tacked to somebody's barn
	door before we get out there!

They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it
into gear and backs out onto Main Street.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE

We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of
town.


EXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE

He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in
procession, some honking their horns, others yelling
cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT


EXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT

ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a
barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged.
The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see
ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.

		ELMER
	Help me Porter, goddammit!

PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING
SOUND. ELMER screams.

		ELMER
	Don't pull me! You want to rip the right
	cheek of my ass right off?

		PORTER
	Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say
	you've been half-assed most of your-

		ELMER
	Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?

PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.


EXT.  IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS
NIGHT

O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that
priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.

SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD

		VIRGIL
	Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.

		O'BANION
	Come on. Be careful.

They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some
knee-high brush.

SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.

O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.

		VIRGIL
	Rev'runt! What is it?

		O'BANION (screaming)
	My foot! My foot!

VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.


EXT.  O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV

A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably
catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty
teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.


EXT.  O'BANION AND VIRGIL

		O'BANION (SCREAMING)
	Get it off me! Get it off me!

		VIRGIL (flustered)
	Sure...okay...

He kneels down.


EXT.  VIRGIL

He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.


EXT.  O'BANION

Relaxing.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.


EXT.  VIRGIL

Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his
hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.


EXT.  REVEREND O'BANION

He screams.


EXT.  THE MOON, CU

It slides behind a cloud.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING.


EXT.  ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP

ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and
MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR.
ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.

They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES.
We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has
gone out of the evening.

They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is
filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of
it. There are woods on the far side.

		ANDY (pointing across)
	It came from over there.

		BOBBY ROBERTSON
	As far as I could tell, it could have come
	from anywhere.

		ANDY
	We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the
	bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.

		BOBBY
	I dunno-

		MAGGIE
	I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade
	in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in
	it, Bobby?

ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY
McCLAREN smile a little.

		OWEN (quietly)
	Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.

		BOBBY (stoutly)
	I ain't scared! Let's go!

		ANDY
	Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE

Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still
over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is
holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY
McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.

They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for
anything- at least, they think so.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT

They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their
way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push
toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.

SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.

They all stop, scared.

		BILLY McCLAREN
	Where's it coming from? Other side?

		BOBBY
	No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't
	trust-

		ASPINALL
	It isn't on either side.

		ANDY
	What are you-

ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.

		ASPINALL
	It's under the fog. It's right in with us.

The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:

SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.

SOUND: A SCREAM.


EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE

He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,
that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.
He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He
goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and
then it disappears.

SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.

ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a
drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE

They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in
the ranks where EDGAR was.


EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU

		BOBBY (moaning)
	I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!


EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE

The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE
LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath.


EXT.  ASPINALL, CU

		ASPINALL (low)
	I think we better start backing up, Andy.
	Real slow. Real-

The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist,
snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S
voice:

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"

SOUND: CHOMP!

ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist.
There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face
is gone.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	"Real slow! Real slow!"

A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down.


EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP

They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one
side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.


EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV

THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like
being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.

		WEREWOLF (voice; laughing)
	"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"


EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER

He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He
whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.

		OWEN
	Come on, then! You want to rock and roll
	with me?


EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV

For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises
out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with
gore.

		WEREWOLF
	"REEEEEL SLOW!"


EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY

		MAGGIE (shrieking)
	Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!

		ANDY (groaning with fear)
	I don't want to look at it.

He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:


EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF

The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with
the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and
slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.

		OWEN
	Come on, come on! You want to do the bop?
	I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!

The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.

Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his
hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The
peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN
shrieks.

		OWEN (voice)
	Come on, you bastard!

The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands
holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM
from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the
WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.


EXT.  THE RAVINE

THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping
down the draw.

Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a
congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the
accompaniment of a pipe organ.

		WEREWOLF (sing-songy voice)
	Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the
	sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing
	in the sheaves...

THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn
overwhelm it and we

				DISSOLVE TO:


INT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING

It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners
are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair
parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and
MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S
funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that
event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's
below us. The hymn ends.


INT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

		LOWE
	Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
	be no mass said here this afternoon. They
	did ask me to say a word of comfort to you
	if I could.


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID

He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.

		HERB
	There is no comfort, Father. Only private
	justice.


INT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an
actor trying to remember his lines.

		LOWE
	Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can
	give you, it's just this: the face of the
	beast always becomes known; the time-

He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.


INT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV

Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was
formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.

		LOWE
	The time... the time of the beast always
	passes. There are answers... ways... ways
	to... to cope... if we turn to each other...

		HERB (bestial voice)
	Father-

LOWE looks toward:


INT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV

He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up
and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green.
As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning
into a werewolf.

		HERB (snarling)
	It tore out his heart.

And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart
up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming
paws.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He staggers back, in terror.

		LOWE (shrieks)
	No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the
church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.

		CONGREGATION
	Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of
	kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the
	dewy eve...

We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is
happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks
up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are
split. He grins, showing big teeth.

They are all changing. Among the things we see are:

PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the
aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two
of them grapple in the aisle.

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket
covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already
the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.

TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;
the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.

At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters
of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled
hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the
organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee
Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the
tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."
It changes into the Rheingold jingle.

		CONGREGATION (snarling chorus)
	My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
	Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...


INT.  LOWE

FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.
The man is in an extremity of terror.

		REV. LOWE
	No! No! No!


INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at
each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of
them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves-
for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the
aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously,
singing.

		CONGREGATION (snarling it out)
	It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
	frosty treat...


INT.  LOWE

He looks toward:


INT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN

She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold
jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to
bubble up between the keys.

		MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL
	Won't you try, won't you buy...


INT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION

The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing
werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell.

		CONGREGATION (big finish)
	...Rheiinngold beer!

Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins.
And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them,
bites the hand's claw off.


INT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM

He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where
there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY
KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a
zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like
it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.

BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.


INT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU

He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running
down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy
and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an
expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.

		LOWE (praying)
	Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please
	let it end.


EXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY

An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY
STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with
possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff
in it.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		HALLER (indifferently)
	Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.

		PETE
	Yeah... but what are they doing?

		HALLER
	Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
	cap, I deduce that they are leaving.


EXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY

They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which
perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place
is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.


EXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK

		HALLER
	She's not the only one. Lot of people
	leaving town. And I guess if we want a
	beer, we'll have to drink it at home.

He nods toward:


EXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV)

A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black
wreath.


EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

		PETE
	Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't
	never seen you like this.

		HALLER (thoughtful)
	I lost my guts.

		PETE (startled)
	Bullshit.

		HALLER
	It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him...
	and I felt it happen. It was no big deal.
	No worse than pissing down your own leg.
	You ever do that? Maybe when you were
	real scared?

PETE, distressed, does not respond.

		HALLER
	One minute I had me some guts- as much as
	the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.

PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.

		PETE
	Joe... you are going to feel better than
	this. This... this feeling of yours...
	it's gonna pass...

		JOE
	Is it?

He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign
out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while
PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.


EXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY

It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted.

THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS
FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON
EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND!

A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued
diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED.
		MARTY (voice)
	It's not fair.


INT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY

It's parked across the road from the sign.

		JANE (voice)
	Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't
	get something he wanted!

They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at
this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream
cones; they are coming home from a family outing.

		NAN COSLAW
	Stop it, Jane.

		JANE
	Well, I don't see why everybody just about
	breaks down and cries whenever he-

		BOB
	Stop it, your mother said.

They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB
pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE IN THE BACKSEAT

JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.


EXT.  ANGLE ON THE COSLAW GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the
CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.


INT.  THE GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver
Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working
through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE
AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor
and pulls it off.

		MARTY
	It isn't enough that the monster killed all
	those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's
	got them to cancel the fair.

		UNCLE AL
	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.

MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed
Shop" printed on it.

		MARTY
	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's
	all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing
	that is just a... a...

		UNCLE AL
	It's just an outward symbol of everything
	that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not
	bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in
	college. I can jive that shit all day.

		MARTY
	Well... I like it that you always know how
	to say things, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my
	ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested
	to hear that.

		MARTY
	Don't call me dear boy.

		UNCLE AL
	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.

		UNCLE AL
	Look at this.

He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated
four-barrel.

		UNCLE AL (gleeful)
	This is gonna turn your wheelchair into
	a fucking F-14, Marty-

He looks around quickly, guiltily.

		UNCLE AL
	Your mom's not around, is she?

		MARTY
	She and dad are out back lighting the
	barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's
	King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

		UNCLE AL
	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be
	Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that
	adjustable.

MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and
starts attaching bolts.

		UNCLE AL
	The guy killed your best friend, drove your
	girl out of town, and stole the second-best
	holiday in the year. Have I got it right?

		MARTY (glum)
	You got it right, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that...
	but I got something that just might cheer
	you up.

		MARTY
	What?

		UNCLE AL
	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, AT THE SIDE OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  DAY

He peeks into the backyard.


EXT.  THE BACK YARD, UNCLE AL'S POV

BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a
badminton birdie.


EXT.  THE ROAD IN FRONT OF COSLAWS', WITH MARTY

MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.

UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.

		UNCLE AL
	All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.

MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the
tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a
poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a
hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.

MARTY looks startled.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Gun it.

MARTY guns it. The engine roars.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus! Not too much!

		MARTY (awed)
	Wow.

		UNCLE AL
	You got a pilot's license, Marty?

		MARTY
	Do I need one?

		UNCLE AL
	We're gonna find out. Take it down the
	road a ways and back. Be careful.

MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but
he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving
along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the
hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying
this.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING

He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!
VRROOM!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU

A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle
engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.

SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!


EXT.  MARTY, CU

Grinning. Looking at:


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV

It's about a quarter of a mile away.


EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver
Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts
back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that
of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a
motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on
his face.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG

Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke
jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the
seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's
laughing like a lunatic.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS

		UNCLE AL (to himself)
	The kid's dead meat. What have I done?
		(shouts)
	Put a rock in it, Marty!


EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET

He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing
rubber.


EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL

The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near
UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns
the engine once and then lets it idle.

		UNCLE AL
	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm
	dying. I hope you're happy, because you
	are looking at a dying man.

		MARTY
	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother
	finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have
	a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna
	Boys' Choir.

		MARTY
	I don't get you.

		UNCLE AL
	I know you don't. But I want this to be our
	secret. You get that, don't you?

		MARTY
	Sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Good.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD

The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs
on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the
f.g.

		UNCLE AL
	I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.

He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.

		NAN
	So have I, actually... I wish it could always
	be like this.

		UNCLE AL
	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure
	I stay out of trouble at least that long.

		MARTY
	Okay.

He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them
with troubled love.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Now I said I had something for you, as
	I believe you will recall.

		MARTY
	Yeah! What is it?

AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper
shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens
the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches
in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,
Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.

An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he
inventories these goodies.

		UNCLE AL
	You're gonna have the Fourth of July in
	October, Marty. Just don't blow your head
	off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't
	just the fireworks. It's because no crazy
	shithead should be able to stop the good
	guys, if you can dig that.

		MARTY (respectfully)
	I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!

		UNCLE AL
	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake-
	someone's killing people. I have to be out of
	my mind to be doing this, you know.

		MARTY
	Yeah, I know. It's great!

		UNCLE AL
	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that
	you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't
	set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?
	Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?

		MARTY
	Yeah... sure.

		UNCLE AL
	Save this one for last.

He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A
fat fuse sticks out behind the head.

		MARTY
	What is it?

		UNCLE AL
	A tracer. You'll like it.

		MARTY
	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em
	in the bushes for now.

MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a
line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets
in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.

		UNCLE AL (grinning)
	Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out
	for the werewolves!

He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.


EXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now
the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the
downspout and begins working his way down. This should not
be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong
MARTY'S arms are.

His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he
reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple
under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the
back porch.

MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a
tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and
gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the
porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he
looks up at:


EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT

Still a light on up there.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

		MARTY (whispers)
	Shit!

Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:


EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE

MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of
exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of
silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes
and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and
starts moving again.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD

The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily
out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly
along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We
can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns
back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's
not going to be deprived of his treat.


EXT.  MARTY

He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the
starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some
more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary
choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It
cranks, but doesn't start.

MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries
again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few
times, it starts.

		MARTY (softly)
	All right!

He puts it in gear and starts off.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG

What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along
a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.

DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.


EXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT

SOUND: Fast-rushing water.

The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with
picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in
the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER
FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the
bottom.

SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.

MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He
stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of
fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time
selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole
cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a
twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top
and lights the fuse.

When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.

		MARTY (soft)
	Here's one for the good guys!


EXT.  THE TWIZZER

It flies in an arc over the drop.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT

THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of
the waterfall's catch pool.

SOUND: Growling.


EXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half
human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but
its face is in shadow.

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.


EXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS

It's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back
quickly.

SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA

He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses
and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the
waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it
on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.

The fountain bursts into a shower of light.

		MARTY (delighted)
	All right!


EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

The waterfall is in the b.g.

The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It goes out.


EXT.  MARTY

He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The
Roman candle shoots into the sky.


EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE

Bursts into colored light.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the
sky.


EXT.  MARTY

He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in
the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.

		MARTY
	Is someone there?


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT

It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.


EXT.  MARTY

With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and
sets it on the ground, as before.


EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT

Claw-hands settle over the top.


EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die
down.


EXT.  MARTY

He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice
when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.


EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it
aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.
Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as
easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a
Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and
advances, hunched over on two legs.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (terrified)
	Who's there?


EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV

The grove is a darkened shadowland.


EXT.  MARTY

He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and
cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,
alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with
terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.


EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV

Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.


EXT.  MARTY

Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor
only cranks. Still no start.


EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET


EXT.  MARTY

He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table
where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the
matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly
drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV

We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much
closer.


EXT.  MARTY

He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same
time.
He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He
puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries
again.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS

He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.

		MARTY (voice; moaning)
	Oh, please...


EXT.  WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING


EXT.  MARTY

He is in an extremity of terror.


EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU

He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It
lights.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague
shadow.

(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is
not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption
that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,
toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change
at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide
coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this
point, I think we would recognize him.)


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to
the fuse. It splutters alight.


EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT

The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer
flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a
pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at
the WEREWOLF's head.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of
fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.


EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET

The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the
fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the
tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in
fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches
out of its way.


EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping
and weeping with fear.


EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE

It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from
its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.


EXT.  THE TRACER, CU

It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with
blood.


EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY

The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of
breath, still deeply frightened.


EXT.  THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF

We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles
through its fingers.

		WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
	Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you!
	Reeeal slow!


EXT.  COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY

He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he
has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.


INT.  MARTY'S BEDROOM

His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the
windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto
his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING

SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)


INT.  THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room,
holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND
goes on.

A CLICK as the phone is picked up.

		UNCLE AL (muzzy voice)
	'Lo? Go away.

		MARTY
	It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-


INT.  UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM

Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American
Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side
of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his
skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and
heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.

		UNCLE AL
	You dreamed it, Marty.

		MARTY (voice)
	No! I went out late last night- and-

		UNCLE AL
	There are no such things as werewolves.
	Please, dear boy, have some pity.

He hangs up and falls back into bed.

		GIRL (muzzy voice)
	Whowuzzit?

		UNCLE AL
	Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.


EXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY

He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard.
JANE comes out.

		JANE
	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting
	here all morning.

		MARTY
	Where's Mom?

		JANE
	Went shopping. Why?

		MARTY
	Jane, I have to talk to you.

		JANE (mistrustfully)
	About what?

MARTY looks at her earnestly.

		MARTY
	I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't
	believe me, and if you won't help me, I...
	I...

MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying.

		JANE (concerned)
	Marty, what is it?


EXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE

JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of
beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading
MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the
Medcu unit.

		JANE (voice-over)
	He told me something that was clearly
	unbelievable... and yet, somehow I
	believed most of it. And I understood
	one thing with total clarity: Marty
	himself believed it all.

She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the
door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT

A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and
a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear
bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being
unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane?

		JANE (politely)
	I'm collecting returnable bottles and
	cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer-
	I just wondered if you had any.

Her husband comes up the hall.

		MR. THAYER
	Who is it?

		MRS. THAYER
	Jane Coslaw.


EXT.  JANE

What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.

		JANE
	Hi, Mr. Thayer.


INT.  LON THAYER, ECU

What we see mostly are his brown eyes.

		MR. THAYER
	Hello, Jane.


EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER

		MRS. THAYER
	Bring your cart around to the back, Jane-
	we'll look in the garage.

		JANE
	Thank you.

She starts down the steps and we


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY

Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing
her cart. Even more bottles in it now.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al
	was thirty-five that summer and I was
	fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe
	the unbelievable, although even then that
	ability is growing rusty, is preparing to
	squeal to a stop.

She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out
front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back
to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around
collar hangs informally on a bush.

		JANE (calls)
	Hi, Father Lowe!

		LOWE (without turning)
	Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!

		JANE
	I'm going to bring in a monster load
	of bottles in an hour or so!

		LOWE (still digging)
	That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.


EXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET

She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart
outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we
see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while
a few men seated at the counter listen.


INT.  JANE, ECU

Wide eyes, mostly.


INT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU

Mostly eyes.


INT.  ROBERTSON'S, FEATURING JANE

As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.


INT.  THE MEN, JANE'S POV

Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others
are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING
THEIR EYES.


EXT.  OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE

She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down
Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.

		JANE (v-o)
	Marty had seen where the tracer had
	struck home, he said, and I went out
	that day doing more than just looking
	for returnable cans and bottles- I was
	looking for a man- or woman- with only
	one eye.


INT.  THE BARBER SHOP  DAY

As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.
Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.
Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial
beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only
one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.

		BILLY
	I know what you're after, Jane, and you're
	out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in
	yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.

		JANE
	Oh... okay.

But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the
man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.


INT.  JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON

		JANE
	That you, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY FAIRTON (muffled)
	No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for
	a shave and a burger.

The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel
away from his eyes. His two eyes.

		JANE (sweetly)
	Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?

		ANDY
	No!

		JANE (just as sweet)
	Oh... okay.

She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she
returns to the door.

		JANE
	'Bye, Mr. McClaren.

		BILLY (amused)
	'Bye, Jane.

		ANDY (muffled)
	Jesus!

JANE goes out.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE RECTORY

She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and
goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She
leaves it there and climbs to the porch.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV

Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe-
or maybe we can't tell.


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

She knocks on the screen door.

		JANE
	Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my
	bottles and cans!


INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a
raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood
smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as
you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say),
but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares-
his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.

		JANE (voice)
	Father?

		LOWE
	Take your cart around to the garage
	and unload, Jane! Then bring me your
	tally sheet!


EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

		JANE
	Okay!


EXT.  JANE, A WIDER SHOT

She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around
the house.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody
chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.


EXT.  JANE, LOWE'S POV

She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage
and utility shed at the back.


INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the
meat again.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE SHED-GARAGE

She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE

This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and
cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which
way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload
her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.

SOUND: SQUEAKING.

JANE looks down.


INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV

A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked
bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.


INT.  JANE

She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,
bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an
overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING
several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then
slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.

JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.


EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY

JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-
her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She
knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It
opens.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?

No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters
the kitchen.


INT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN

She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on
the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down
here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and
into the dark hall.

		JANE
	Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...

Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.

		LOWE (voice)
	Very good, Jane!

She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:


INT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU

Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered
with a black eye-patch.

		LOWE (grins)
	Good, Jane. Very... very good.

He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it
like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black
patch, which tells her everything.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE

		LOWE (concerned)
	Jane! You're trembling!

		JANE
	I... I don't feel so well, I guess
	maybe I got too much sun.

		LOWE
	Would you like to come in the parlor and
	lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink?
	I have some soda-

		JANE
	No! (softer) That is, I have to get home
	and help my mom with lunch.

		LOWE
	I'll give you a ride!

JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.

		JANE
	No- she... she was going to meet me at the
	market. I'll be fine.


INT.  LOWE, CU

How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell
from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.

		LOWE
	Give my best to your brother, Jane.


INT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY

		JANE
	I will.

She bolts.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY

CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.

		LOWE (soft)
	Real slow.


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY

His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.

		MARTY (almost moaning)
	Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?


EXT.  JANE AND MARTY

She's changed into shorts and a blouse.

		JANE
	I ran faster than I ever ran in my life-
	what do you think, dummox? By the time I
	got back here, I really thought I was
	going to faint. (Pause) What are we going
	to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody-
	grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are
	we going to do?

		MARTY (thoughtfully)
	I think I know.


INT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU

A hand- MARTY'S- comes into the frame and prints: I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.


INT.  MARTY'S ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp
focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a
moment, then begins to write again.


INT.  THE NOTEBOOK PAD, CU

He is adding: WHY DON'T YOU KILL YOURSELF?


INT.  MARTY, AT HIS DESK

He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens
a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into
it.


EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET

She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox,
opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope
again.


EXT.  THE ENVELOPE, JANE'S POV

Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY
RECTORY; 149 MAIN STREET/TARKER'S MILLS, MAINE.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAILBOX

She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the
fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward
home.


INT.  THE RECTORY LIVING ROOM, WITH LESTER LOWE

He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open
envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the
lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter
hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper
in his fist.


EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAIN STREET MAILBOX

She drops in another letter and walks away.

		JANE (v-o)
	I mailed another letter for Marty the
	next day... a third the day after that.
	Then, on Saturday...


EXT.  THE TARKER'S MILLS COMMON, LONG

Parked at the curb is UNCLE AL'S sports car.

		JANE (v-o)
	...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.
	(Pause) His reaction was less than serene.


EXT.  UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY, ON THE COMMON

		UNCLE AL
	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!

		JANE
	Uncle Al-

		UNCLE AL (to JANE)
	From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think
	his common sense got paralyzed along with
	his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little
	Polly Practical!

		JANE (quiet)
	You don't understand.

		UNCLE AL (wildly)
	Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that
	my niece and nephew are sending the local
	Catholic priest little love notes suggesting
	that he gargle with a broken light bulb or
	eat a rat-poison omelet!

		MARTY
	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's
	wearing an eye-patch!

		UNCLE AL
	I called Peltzer on my way over here,
	Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore
	two days ago for a bottle of otic solution.
	That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's
	got a corneal inflammation.

		MARTY
	Was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	What the hell does that matter?

		MARTY
	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because
	to get a prescription he'd have to see a
	doctor.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!

		MARTY
	Well... was it a prescription?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't know. But I know you didn't see
	any werewolf the other night, Marty. You
	had a dream, that's all. An extremely
	realistic nightmare brought on by what's
	been happening in this town.

		MARTY
	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in
	his shed? You know who used to have a
	baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He
	was so proud of it he used to carry it in
	the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it
	looked like the Green Giant used it for
	a toothpick!

		UNCLE AL
	You want to know what I think?

		MARTY
	No- we just got you out here so we could
	admire your pretty face.

		UNCLE AL
	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a
	hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or
	something.

		JANE (indignant)
	It was not! You want me to show you! Come
	on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!

		UNCLE AL
	No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for
	palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic
	Werewolf.

JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of
	it by now anyway.


EXT.  OUTSIDE OF ROBERTSON'S LUNCHEONETTE

The Silver Bullet stands outside. The door opens and UNCLE
AL, JANE, and MARTY come out. UNCLE AL is carrying MARTY
piggyback. MARTY has an ice cream cone. JANE is holding two.

UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY
starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone.
The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS
THEM.

		JANE
	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb,
	why hasn't he picked up the telephone and
	called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's
	sending poison-pen letters?

		UNCLE AL
	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his
	letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept
	the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw
	Marty in his wheelchair.

		JANE
	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told
	Constable Haller that someone is sending
	him poison-pen letters?

UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:


EXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV

LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed)
	Well... he probably did. I mean, he could
	make a complaint without taking an ad out
	in the paper, couldn't he?

		MARTY
	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff
	was nonprescription. And I'll bet you
	another quarter he hasn't said anything
	to Mr. Haller.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, do you see your suspect?


EXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE

Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE
waves back.


EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

		MARTY (grim)
	Yes, I see him.

		UNCLE AL
	Do you really think that a man who took
	a rocket in the eye three nights ago
	could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either
	be in the hospital... or dead.

		MARTY
	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot
	him when he was-

		UNCLE AL
	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.
	Jane, you don't really believe this madness,
	do you?

		JANE
	I don't know exactly what I believe. But I
	know that what I saw was a baseball bat and
	not a broomstick. I know there was something
	strange about the way the house smelled that
	day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I
	believe in Marty. I mean- there are times
	when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but
	I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to
	believe in him, too, Uncle Al.

UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he
throws his hands up in disgust.

		UNCLE AL
	Kids!

He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.

She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to
catch up.


EXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY

It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In
the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back
to us in his wheelchair, watching.


EXT.  AN OLD COUPE

It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER
LOWE is behind the wheel.

SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE.


EXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK.


EXT.  LESTER LOWE

		LOWE (quietly)
	Little bastard.


EXT.  A FLY BALL


EXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT

The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward
town.


EXT.  MARTY

The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances
his way.

		OUTFIELDER
	You comin' down to Robertson's for a
	soda, Marty?

		MARTY
	No- I guess I'll go home.

I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression
in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.

		OUTFIELDER
	Okay- seeya!

		MARTY
	Yeah... seeya.

He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

He starts it up.


EXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV

He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the
other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the
road.


EXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV

MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer
to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL

He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.

		LOWE (whispers)
	Bastard.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's
playing center field for the Dodgers.

SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA


EXT.  MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE

MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across
the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way
by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.

LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into
the ditch.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE

		LOWE
	Oh, you bastard!

He floors the engine.


EXT.  THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS

Spinning helplessly in the dirt.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE COUPE

He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever
into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto
the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing
Silver Bullet.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY

He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks
behind.


EXT.  THE COUPE

Roars toward THE CAMERA.


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.


EXT.  CHASE MONTAGE

The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple:
LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country
road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a
couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have
him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE
ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers:
ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE
JESUS!

As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is
gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he
looks down at:


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

The needle is all the way over on "E."


EXT.  MARTY

He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.


EXT.  THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET

LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves
from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for
the moment but almost overturning in the process.

They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in
fact.


EXT.  THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE

Now the needle is actually past "E."


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY
	Come on, baby... come on...

His face registers hope as he sees:


EXT.  ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV

AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES
PROHIBITED!


EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going
for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's
motor COUGHS.


EXT.  THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:
BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow
makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the
Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the
mouth of the covered bridge.


EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a
halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.


EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND
SPLUTTERING.


EXT.  THE COUPE

It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop.


INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL

His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become
the face of a gargoyle.


EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET

It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of
the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine
through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.
The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair
sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage
is about seventy feet.

About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last
cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along
silently, going on its dying momentum.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under
the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.


EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE

Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE
CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair
is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:


EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the
sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when
one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal
maniac close behind.


EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE

		LOWE (soft voice)
	Marty...

MARTY'S head whips around.


EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S
silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of
footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.


INT.  LOWE'S SHOES

Sensible black Oxfords.

		LOWE
	I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if
	you believe that or not, but it's true. I
	would never willingly hurt a child. You
	should have left me alone, Marty.

SOUND of footfalls resumes.


EXT.  MARTY

He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he
wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.


INT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS

		LOWE (soft; soothing)
	I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our
	religion teaches that suicide is the
	greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.
	Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide;
	if she had done so, she would be burning in
	hell right now. By killing her I took her
	physical life but saved her life eternal.
	You see, Marty? You see how all things serve
	the will and the mind of God? You see, you
	meddling little shit!

He begins to walk forward again.


EXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV

He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not
hurrying.

		LOWE
	You're going to have a terrible accident,
	Marty. You're going to fall into the river.

SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.


EXT.  MARTY

TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER.

MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward:


EXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV

THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER
ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure
spreader which is mostly empty.


EXT.  MARTY

		MARTY (waving madly)
	Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE

He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal
cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile.
Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?


EXT.  ELMER AND MARTY

ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it
around. MARTY looks back at:


INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Empty.

SOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT.


EXT.  MARTY AND ELMER

MARTY looks back at ELMER.

		MARTY
	I ran out of gas.

		ELMER
	Spooky in there, ennit?

		MARTY (with feeling)
	It sure is!

He looks back once more toward:


EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE


			DISSOLVE TO:


EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD  DAY

MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking
croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.

MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls
over.

		UNCLE AL
	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow
	without the hair and the foaming jaws.
	Also, I checked on the otic solution.
	It was counter brand. No prescription
	needed.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		UNCLE AL
	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.

		JANE (sits down)
	Did you talk to the constable?

		UNCLE AL
	After Marty called me with his latest
	Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause)
	He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged
	at all.

		MARTY
	I told you!

		JANE
	Shut up, Marty.

		UNCLE AL (reluctantly)
	There's something else.

	MARTY					JANE
What is it?					What other thing?

		UNCLE AL
	I probably shouldn't tell you- you're
	both hysterical on the subject. I'm
	starting to feel like a guy handing
	out free Arthur Murray coupons to
	victims of the dancing sickness.

		MARTY
	Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-

He makes strangling gestures.

		UNCLE AL (reluctant)
	I went out to that rest area.

		MARTY (triumph)
	You found the tracer?

		UNCLE AL
	No... but I found some blood, smeared on
	a tree trunk in that grove.

		MARTY
	There! You see!

		UNCLE AL
	It could have been anything, Marty.

		MARTY
	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his
	car and trying to run me down? You don't
	think that was a dream, do you?

		UNCLE AL
	No.

UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He
looks down at:


EXT.  THE FRAME OF THE BULLET

There's a scrape and a dent where LOWE'S coupe dented it.
There is also a fleck of paint.


EXT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE, CU

		UNCLE AL
	Lowe's car-?

		JANE
	Blue. This blue.

		UNCLE AL
	Jesus.


EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

Three-quarters full.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE
AL'S sports car is parked out front.


INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL

HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands
laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL.
There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it,
UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.

		HALLER
	That's just about the craziest damn story
	I've ever heard, Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I know. I could have edited out all of the
	completely crazy stuff, but I thought you
	deserved to hear it with the bark on.

		HALLER
	I appreciate that. Now, the next question:
	Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?

		UNCLE AL
	Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should
	be checked out.

HALLER rises.

		HALLER
	That can be arranged.

They shake hands.


EXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT

A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the
side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he
does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over
his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's
shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember
them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the
picture. He goes up the walk.

HALLER rings the doorbell.

No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one
comes. He leans down and looks through a side window.


INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV

No one there.


EXT.  HALLER

He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and
then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and
looks in.


EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV

LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans.


INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER

He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down.
In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda
cans.

HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He
lights it and looks at:


INT.  THE COUPE, CU

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in
the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come
into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE
CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY
has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does
LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.


INT.  HALLER

His eyes widen.

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about
nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum
scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and
werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In
one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.

HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA
CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and
falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy,
but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and
again and again.


EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE
DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.
The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.

		MARTY
	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and
	guess what? No one sees him again!

		UNCLE AL
	And what do you suggest I do about it,
	dear boy?

MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it
to UNCLE AL.

		MARTY
	I want you to turn this into a silver
	bullet.

		UNCLE AL
	You're not going to let it go, are you?

		MARTY
	I saw what I saw.

		UNCLE AL
	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

		JANE (quietly)
	In the made-up stories, the guy who's the
	werewolf only changes when the moon is full.
	But maybe he's really that way almost all
	the time, only as the moon gets fuller...

		MARTY (finishes)
	...the guy gets wolfier.

		JANE (hands AL her crucifix)
	Here. Take mine, too.

		MARTY
	Jane... you don't have to do that.

		JANE
	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I
	don't, booger-brains.

		MARTY
	Will you marry me, Jane?

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy
	Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?

		JANE
	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

		MARTY
	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or
	exactly what it is- but people still
	believe in it.

		UNCLE AL
	The kid is eleven years old and already
	he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

		MARTY
	I think he's going to come for me. Not
	just because I know who he is, but
	because I hurt him. Only I don't think
	he'll try again as Lowe.

		UNCLE AL
	Dear boy, you have gone right out of
	your mind.

		MARTY
	Will you do it?

UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.


EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the
wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short
lane and into a gravel pit.

THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can
see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's
bloody and chewed.


EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY

The wagon pulls in.


INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

		MARTY
	Please, Uncle Al.

		JANE
	Will you?

The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from
the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the
medal and looks at it.

		UNCLE AL
	All right. I give up. Yes.

  MARTY							JANE
All right! Thanks!				Thank you, Uncle Al!

		UNCLE AL
	If either of you ever tells anyone I even
	bought a piece of this story, werewolves
	will be the least of your problems.


EXT./INT.  SILVER BULLET MONTAGE

a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.

		JANE (voice-over)
	Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a
	gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an
	old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard
	of weapons.

b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All
Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,
using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale
is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	God knows what sort of story my uncle
	told him, but I think that for men who
	have been married as often as Uncle Al,
	invention on short notice becomes
	something of a specialty.

c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
	silver content of my crucifix and Marty's
	medallion...

d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S
melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.

		JANE (v-o continues)
	...melted them down...

e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.

		JANE (v-o concludes)
	...and molded them into a silver bullet.


INT.  MAC'S GUN SHOP, WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL  DAY

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He
puts it down on the glass counter top.

		MAC
	Here it is.


INT.  THE BOX, CU

MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on
dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a
pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet
optically- not much, just a little- to make it look
absolutely magical. Almost holy.


INT.  MAC AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to
the light.

		MAC
	Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think.
	It's got a low-grain load so it won't
	tumble. Should be pretty accurate.

		UNCLE AL
	It's just a gag, that's all. What would
	you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?

		MAC (joking)
	How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy
	Halloween, Al.


EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm summer air.

		JANE (voice-over)
	By the time Marty's silver bullet was done,
	it was Halloween... and the full moon had
	come around again. Earlier that afternoon,
	my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer
	for over seven years, finally finished the job.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved
jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door.
UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon
is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway;
MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.

NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has
obviously been crying.

		NAN
	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton
	in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral
	parlor. It's Stickney and-

		UNCLE AL
	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!

The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.

		NAN
	And don't open the door for any trick or
	treaters even if they come!

		UNCLE AL
	We won't!

The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out
again.

		NAN
	You kids go to bed on time! You've got
	school tomorrow!

		UNCLE AL
	If you keep doing that, you're going to
	bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama-
	tell her I'll see her Thursday.

		NAN
	I will- be good, kids.

  MARTY							JANE
'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!				We will! 'Bye!

The station wagon accelerates away.

		UNCLE AL
	Can I tell you kids something?

		JANE
	Sure, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	When me and sissy were kids, we were
	just like you two.

		MARTY
	Yeah? Really?

		UNCLE AL
	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still
	are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

He ushers them inside and closes the door.


INT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN

		BOB
	I can't believe that you'd agree to leave
	the kids with him. A year ago I would have
	laughed at the idea. You used to almost
	breathe fire when Al came in the house.

		NAN
	He's changed. Just this summer. Or
	something's changed him. Marty, maybe.
	And the drinking- I think it's almost
	stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful.
	And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure
	of it.

		BOB
	I know they'll be safe with him... but will
	he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?

		NAN (firmly)
	If I told him to, he will.


INT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

It reads 1:00.

SOUND: The National Anthem.


INT.  THE TV, CU

The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card.

		ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	This concludes WDML's broadcast day.

The TV goes to snow.


INT.  JANE ON THE COUCH

She's mostly asleep in one corner.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's also dozing.


INT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV

He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans
in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is
smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his
lap.


EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE

The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side
yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of
the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom).


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-
it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this,
its one eye flaring.

DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to
his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.

MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.


EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its
jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS
GROW LOUDER.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY

UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette
out of his lap and puts it out.

		JANE (sleepy)
	You'll burn yourself up sometime doing
	that, Uncle Al.

		UNCLE AL
	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

		MARTY
	But Uncle Al! You said-

		UNCLE AL
	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten
	past one. He's not coming.

		JANE
	The moon's not down yet...

		UNCLE AL
	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this
	stupid gun in my lap because I promised,
	but you two are going to bed. Go on,
	now, scoot.

JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.

		MARTY
	What if I say no?

		UNCLE AL
	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.
	(more kindly) Go on, now.

MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs,
where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the
living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and
stops.

		MARTY
	If that'd gone off, it would have been the
	end of our silver bullet.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down
and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five
chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet
into his hand.

		UNCLE AL
	See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.

Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its
green eye flaring.


INT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is
looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.

		JANE (shrieking)
	It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!
	IT'S THE WEREWOLF!

She's pointing at the window.


INT.  UNCLE AL

He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL
has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the
silver bullet loosely held in the other.

Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to
the kids.

		UNCLE AL (sharply)
	You see it, Marty!


INT.  MARTY

		MARTY (shakes his head)
	I was looking at you...


INT.  UNCLE AL

His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare
is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're
just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is
actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!

		UNCLE AL
	A very familiar feeling is beginning to
	creep over me.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

JANE is crying.

		MARTY
	What's that, Uncle Al?


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	I feel like a horse's ass.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

		JANE (weeping)
	I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!

MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a
comforting arm around her shoulder.

		JANE
	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!

		MARTY
	Jane-


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Would you kids go to bed? My head's
	starting to ache.


EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, ECU

We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close
around a thick wire.

		WEREWOLF (voice)
	Reeeal slow...

It yanks.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

The lights go out.

JANE SHRIEKS.

		MARTY
	It's here! It's outside!


INT.  UNCLE AL

		UNCLE AL
	Jane, it's just a power fai-

He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall-
not just the window it was looking through before but the
whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way
through, roaring.

UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire-
but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are
empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF
smashes him aside.


INT.  UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE

He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver
bullet another.


INT.  THE GUN

It spins into a living-room corner.


INT.  THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION

We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes
down, hits the floor, and rolls.


INT.  THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION

In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling
toward it.


INT.  MARTY AND JANE

		MARTY
	Get the gun!

He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into
the hall.


INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION

The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In
the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.

He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.

His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in
the heating vent.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his
shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the
pistol.

The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through
the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and
hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward
her.


INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Comes toward her.


INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER

She makes as if to run one way.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is
toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.


INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU

A bloodstained hand grabs a poker.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE

As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and
strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.

UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.

It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it
aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that
now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.


INT.  JANE

She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward
the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Its head whips around.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille
off. One arm is down inside.

		MARTY (scream)
	Janey! The gun! THE GUN!


INT.  JANE

She tosses it awkwardly.


INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION

It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,
awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

		WEREWOLF (snarls)
	Maa-aaa-rty...

It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing
things out of its way.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the
heating duct again...


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping
fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an
inch out of reach.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF (foaming)
	Maaa-aaa-rty...


INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR

		JANE (sobbing)
	Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!

She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.


INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back
into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this
is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't
have to pay for.

		WEREWOLF
	Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-


INT.  MARTY, CU

He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the
approaching WEREWOLF.


INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.


INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet
blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the
cylinder closed.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!


INT.  MARTY

He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a
click. An expression of dismay on his face.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

		WEREWOLF
	Kill you...


INT.  MARTY

He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.
He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The
Bullet hits the wall.


INT.  MARTY

Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a
third time. Click!

The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.


INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU

		WEREWOLF
	Bastard Marty!

It bends down, reaching.


INT.  MARTY, ECU

Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls
the trigger again.


INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE

The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF

The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He
flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and
crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits
there, roaring... and then it begins to change.


INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE

She lies there, sobbing.

		UNCLE AL (voice)
	You okay, Janey?


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps
JANE up.

		JANE
	I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.


INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU

Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;
it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.

It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.


INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR

		MARTY (calls)
	I'm all right. He's dead.


INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in
the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying
on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...
and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at
her.

She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really
dead. I think. Until the sequel.


INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY

UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing
again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and
draws her down beside himself and MARTY.

		UNCLE AL (to MARTY)
	There. I told you there weren't any such
	things as werewolves.

They smile at each other with love.

		JANE (nervous)
	Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or
	whatever it is?

		UNCLE AL
	If it isn't now, it will be after I pound
	one of your mother's silver candlesticks
	through its heart.

		JANE (grimaces)
	Oh Uncle Al, no!

		UNCLE AL (grim)
	Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I
	believe it all the way.

He gets up and leaves.

		JANE
	Are you all right, Marty?

		MARTY
	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

		JANE
	You're a real booger, you know it?

		MARTY (smiles)
	I love you, Jane.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG  NIGHT

Quiet. Sleeping.

		JANE (voice-over)
	It wasn't always easy for me to answer
	that... but I could answer it that night,
	and I find I can say it now that the
	terrible events of that fall have receded
	to memories which seem little more than
	dreams in my mind.


INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

		JANE (hugging him)
	I love you, Marty.


EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG

		JANE (voice-over; no more than a whisper)
	I love you, Marty... good night.

THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.

	INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

	A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of
	a basement.

	LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

	Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands
	in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
	her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
	come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

	She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.
	She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she
	slides it out.

	Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.
	It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her
	breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly
	uncomfortable.

	Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster
	than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst
	of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

	WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.

	THE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

	Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
	Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty
	bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

	Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
	She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
		It's getting cold.

	MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
	tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
	brirfcase next to him.

	Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
	intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His
	charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

			     MALCOLM
		That's one fine frame.  A fine
		frame it is.

	Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
	dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
	The frame is a polished mahogany.

	He slips on the sweatshirt.

			     MALCOLM
		How much does a fine frame like
		that cost, you think?

	Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
			(smiling)
		I've never told you...  but you
		sound a little like Dr. Seuss when
		you're drunk.

	Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,
		Anna.

	Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get
	it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention
	slowly moves to the framed certificate.

			     ANNA
		Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at
		least a couple hundred.  Maybe
		three.

			     MALCOLM
		Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a
		C.D. rack for the bedroom.

			     ANNA
		Do you know how important this is?
		This is big time.
			(beat)
		I'm going to read it for you,
		doctor.

			     MALCOLM
		Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

	Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward
	her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
	tickle her.

			     ANNA
		In recognition for his outstanding
		achievement in the field of child
		psychology, his dedication to his
		work, and his continuing efforts to
		improve the quality of life for
		countless children and their
		families, the City of Philadelphia
		proudly bestows upon its son Dr.
		Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...
		the Mayor's Citation for
		Professional Excellence.

	Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

			     ANNA
		Wow.  They called you their son.

			     MALCOLM
		We can keep it in the bathroom.

	Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		It's not real, Anna.  Some
		secretary wrote that up.  Don't
		tell me you thought it was real?

	Anna's expression becomes serious.


			     MALCOLM
		What?

	She just keeps staring.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't do the quiet thing.  You know
		I hate it.

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		This is an important night for us.
		Finally someone is recognizing the
		sacrifices you made.  That you have
		put everything second, including me,
		for those families they're talking
		about.

	Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and
	holds them steady.

			     ANNA
		They're also saying that my husband
		has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift
		that allows him to hit a ball over a
		fence.  Or a gift that lets him
		produce beautiful images on a
		canvas...  Your gift teaches
		children how to be strong in
		situations where most adults would
		piss on themselves.
			(beat)
		Yes, I believe what they wrote
		about you.

	Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm
	smiles softly.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.

	Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What are we hugging about again?

	Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

			     ANNA
		Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to
		be any crying at this celebration.
		Just a lot of drinking and sex.

	Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

			     MALCOLM
		I would like some red wine in a
		glass.

	Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

			     MALCOLM
		I would not like it in a mug.  I
		would not like it in a jug.

	Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up
	laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to
	turn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

			     MALCOLM
		Bulb's out.

	Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
	bedroom.

	MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

	A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
	room.

	Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a
	pretend striptease song.

	Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling
	off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her
	playful dance.  She's facing away from him.

	He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's
	face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
	WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A
	lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

	Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
	awareness.

			     ANNA
		He's still in the house.

	A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.

	ANNA SCREAMS.

	Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

	Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know
	someone is inside.  Beat.

	Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that
	comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the
	figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested
	in the back of the bathroom.

	NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.

	The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes
	bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands
	are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a
	patch of white in his hair.

	Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off
	the stranger.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

	Anna barely nods her understanding.

			     MALCOLM
			(to the stranger)
		This is forty-seven Locust Street.
		You have broken a window and
		entered a private residence.  Do
		you understand what I'm saying?

	The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock
	on Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		You don't know so many things.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		There are no needles or
		prescription drugs of any kind in
		this house.

	The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm
	stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

	Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of
	color.

	The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

			     STRANGER
		Are you drunk?

	The stranger's stare slides to Anna.

			     STRANGER
		Did you get him drunk?

	The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A
	penetrating, unwavering stare.


			     STRANGER
		Do you know why you're scared when
		you're alone?

	Anna's expression instanly changes.

			     STRANGER
		I know.

	BEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.

			     MALCOLM
		What do you want?  I don't
		understand what you want.

	The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		What you promised.

	Malcolm stops all movement.

			     ANNA
		--My God.

			     MALCOLM
		--Do I know you?

			     STRANGER
		Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe. Recipient of awards from the
		Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe, he's helped so many children...
		And he doesn't even remember my
		name?

	Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to
	tremble.

			     STRANGER
		I was ten when you worked with me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

			     STRANGER
		Downtown clinic?  Single parent
		family?
			(beat)
		I had a possible mood disorder...
			(beat)
		I had no friends... you said I was
		socially isolated.
			(beat)
		I was afraid -- you called it acute
		anxiety...
			(beat)
		You were wrong.
			(beat)
		Come on, clear your head...  Male,
		nine...  Single parent...  Mood
		discorder... Acute anxiety.

	Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

			     STRANGER
		I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my
		system twenty-four hours a day...
		I still have no friends.  I still
		have no peace.  I'm still afraid.

	Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.

			     STRANGER
		...I'm still afraid.

	Malcolm stands.

			     MALCOLM
		Please give me a second to think.

	Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
	stranger.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Bed Freidken?

			     STRANGER
		Some people call me freak.

			     MALCOLM
		...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

	Tears fall down the stranger's face.

			     STRANGER
		I am a freak.

	Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks
	in his head.

			     MALCOLM
		--Vincent?

	THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.

			     MALCOLM
		Vincent Gray?

	VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

	Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
	waters.

			     MALCOLM
		I do remember you, Vincent.  You
		were a good kid.  Very smart...
		Quiet...  Compassionate...
		Unusually compassionate...

	Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

			     VINCENT
		You forgot cursed.

	VINCENT is fully crying now.

			     VINCENT
		You failed me.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help
		you...  I can try to help you now.

	Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and
	raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
	ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
	onto the bed.

	Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER
	HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the
	bathroom floor.

	ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON

	The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

	A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten
	notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,
	"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

	The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

	He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled
	throughout the file.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page
	reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

	As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
	and phrases circled throughout this new case history.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
	Crowe.

	Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
	across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

	A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

	COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy
	with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
	him.

	His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
	Cole carefully locks the door behind him.

	He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
	Anxiously.

	The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
	pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

	Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down
	and buttons his jacket.

	When he looks up, Cole is gone.

	Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full
	speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS
	SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.

	For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He
	stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a
	street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a
	parking lot.

	COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
	building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
	ornate doors.  He slips inside.

	Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and
	then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone
	and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
	around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
	quietly.

	A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it
	quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
	doors.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - DAY

	Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

	Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
	in the last row of the church.

	He moves down the center aisle towards the back.

	Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
	beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
	other.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Pro... Fun... Add...

	The words are unintelligible.

	Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
	him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body
	still with fear.

			     MALCOLM
		It's okay, Cole.  Don't be
		frightened.

	Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

			     MALCOLM
		My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I
		was supposed to meet you today.
		Sorry I missed our appointment.

	Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you mind if I sit down?  I have
		this injury from a couple of years
		ago and it flares up every once in
		a while just so I won't forget it.

	Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
	the seat.  Malcolm sits.

	Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and
	stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		Your eye frames.  They don't seem to
		have any lenses in them.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt
		my eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I knew there was a sound explanation.

	Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What was that you were saying
		before with your soldiers?  Day pro
		fun.

			     COLE
		...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

	Malcolm stares surprised.

			     COLE
		It's called Latin.  It's a
		language.

	Malcolm nods at the information.

			     MALCOLM
		All your soldiers speak Latin?

			     COLE
		No, just one.

	Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
	Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.

	Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost
	healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I like churches, too.
			(beat)
		In olden times, in Europe, people
		used to hide in churches.  Claim
		sanctuary.

	Cole looks up.

			     COLE
		What were they hiding from?

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad
		people for one.  People who wanted
		to imprison them.  Hurt them.

			     COLE
		Nothing bad can happen in a church,
		right?

	Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

			     MALCOLM
		Right.

	Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

			     COLE
		I forgot your name.

			     MALCOLM
		Dr. Crowe.

			     COLE
		You're a doctor.  What kind?

			     MALCOLM
		I work with young people who might
		be sad or upset or just want to
		talk.  I try to help them figure
		things out.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Are you a good doctor?

	Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		I got an award once.  From the
		Mayor.

			     COLE
		Congratulations.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.  It was a long time ago.
		I've kind of been retired for a
		while.
			(beat)
		You're my very first client back.

			     COLE
		You use needles?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		Not even little ones that aren't
		supposed to hurt?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		That's good.

	Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

			     COLE
		I'm going to see you again, right?

			     MALCOLM
		If it's okay with you?

	Cole thinks it over carefully.

			     COLE
		It's okay with me.

	Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

			     MALCOLM
		And Cole, next time I won't be late
		for you.

			     COLE
		Next time I won't be scared of you.

	Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses
	himself in his thoughts.

	When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
	take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the
	statue and quietly leaves the church.

	Malcolm just sits and stares.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING

	The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

			     MALCOLM
		It's me.

	He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He
	stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or
	"Final Notice" stamped on it.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

	Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place
	setting on the table.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS
	ON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.

	Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

	He stares at his wife...

	She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He
	takes it in silently.

	His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her
	soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly
	looks like an angel.

	Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

	THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm
	reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file
	cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits
	in the corner next to the wine racks.

	The room still feels unsettling.

	Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of
	dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

	The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

	Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten
	on the first page are the words,

		"De profundis calms ad te, domine"

	Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to
	each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

	Malcolm translates the last word.

	He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

		"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...The mass for the dead.

	The words seem to hang in the air forever.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

	Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back
	in time.

	A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical
	old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of
	the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence
	Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot
	statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the
	morning sky...

	AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

	FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and
	hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon
	restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make
	their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

	A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

	A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out
	of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.

	LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.

	She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly
	for work.

	Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South
	Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of
	Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and
	sweet-looking young woman.

	Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.

	A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.

	Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are
	open.

	Lynn shakes her head.

			     LYNN
		Cole.

	She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

	Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises
	the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine.

	TINY FOOTSTEPS.

	Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.

			     LYNN
		Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

	Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie.

			     LYNN
		You got a spot.

	Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as
	Lynn walks back into the laundry room.

	The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
	new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the
	kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

	Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.

	Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on
	the tabletop.

	He looks shaken.

	Neither says anything for a beat.

			     LYNN
			(shaken)
		Something you were looking for,
		baby?

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		Pop Tarts.

	Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts
	are clearly visible.

			     LYNN
		They're right here.

			     COLE
		Oh.

	Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make
	eye contact.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		Lots of things.

			     COLE
		Anything bad about me?

	Lynn leans down.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole does.

			     LYNN
		I wasn't thinking anything bad
		about you, got it?

	He looks at her eyes.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Got it.

	THE DOOR BELL RINGS.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		That's Tommy, Momma.

	Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.

			     LYNN
		Don't you want this?

	Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and
	takes them from her before leaving.

	Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the
	TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

	Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps
	her arms around her shivering shoulders.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - MORNING

	TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid
	who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school
	uniform.

	Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.
	Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.

	The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy
	puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.

	When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,
	Tommy rips his arm away.

			     TOMMY
		Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm
		around your shoulder" bit.  I just
		made it up.  Went with it.  That's
		what great actors do.  It's called
		improv.

	Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals.

			     TOMMY
			(taunting)
		Be careful...  I hope no one jumps
		out and gets you.

	Tommy runs away.

	Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. ANTHONY'S ACADEMY - MORNING

	The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of
	St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.

	Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.
	He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.

	Beat.

	He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by
	himself into the school.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

	The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He
	looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn
	seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with
	her.  They both look up.

	Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		How was school, baby?

	Cole shrugs.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		You know, you can tell me things if
		you need to.

	Cole doesn't respond.  Beat.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		Well, you know what I did today?

	Cole shakes his head "No."

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in
		the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate
		a big picnic in the park with lots
		of chocolate mouses pie and then
		swam in the fountain all afternoon...
			(smiling)
		What did you do?

	Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was picked first for kickball
		teams at recess.  I hit a grand
		slam to win the game and everyone
		lifted me up on their shoulders and
		carried me around cheering.

	Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.

	Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile.

			     LYNN
		I'll make triangle pancakes.  You
		got an hour.

	Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the
	kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the
	corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

	Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.

	He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to sit?

	Cole nods very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Don't feel like talking right now?

	Cole nods again very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		How about we play a game first?

	Cole looks a little more interested.

			     MALCOLM
		It's a mind-reading game...  Did I
		mention I could read minds?

	Cole nods, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Here's the game.  I'll read your
		mind.  If what I say is right, you
		take a step forwards the chair.  If
		I'm wrong, you take a step
		backwards the doorway.  If you
		reach the chair, you sit.  If you
		reach the door, you can go.  Deal?

	Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville
	magician.  He closes his eyes tight.

			     MALCOLM
		Just after your mom and dad were
		divorced, your mom went to a doctor
		like me and it didn't help her.
		And so you think I'm not going to
		help you.

	Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.

			     MALCOLM
		You're worried because she said she
		told him things.  Things she
		couldn't tell anybody else.
			(beat)
		Secrets.

	Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		You have a secret.  But you don't
		want to tell me.

	Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at
	the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		You don't have to tell me your
		secret if you don't want to.

	Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading
	position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE
	SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably
	slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father gave you that watch as
		a present before he left.

	Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands
	surprised.

			     COLE
		He forgot it in a drawer.  It
		doesn't work.

	Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a
	little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't like to say much at
		school.  You're an excellent
		student however.  You've never been
		in any kind of serious trouble.

	Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		We were supposed to draw a picture.
		Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.
		He got hurt in the neck by another
		man with a screwdriver.

	AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE OVERTAKES THE DEN.

			     MALCOLM
		You saw that on T.V., Cole?

	Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Everybody got upset.  They had a
		meeting.  Momma started crying.
			(beat)
		I don't draw like that anymore.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you draw now?

			     COLE
		I draw people with smiles, dogs
		running, and rainbows.
			(beat)
		They don't have meetings about
		rainbows.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		I guess they don't.

	Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the
	doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He
	doesn't move at all.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What am I thinking now?

	Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No
	fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You're thinking...
			(beat)
		I don't know what you're thinking,
		Cole.

	Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was thinking...  you're nice.
			(beat)
		But you can't help me.

	Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the
	empty doorway where his client used to stand.

	THE DEN IS SUFFOCATED WITH SILENCE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian
	restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many
	candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.

	Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten
	dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE
	OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

	Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across
	from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I thought you meant the other
		Italian restaurant I asked you to
		marry me in.

	Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm so sorry.
			(beat)
		I can't seem to keep track of time.

	Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.

			     MALCOLM
		It didn't go well today.  Spent
		some time after trying to get my
		head together.

	Anna looks around for the waiter.

			     MALCOLM
		They're so similar, Anna.  They
		have the same mannerisms.  The same
		expressions.  The same thing
		hanging over them.
			(beat)
		It might be some kind of abuse.

	That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then
	looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		There are cuts on Cole's arms.
		Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks
		like defensive cuts.

	Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.

			     MALCOLM
			(beat)
		Possibly a teacher, neighbor.
			(beat)
		I don't think it's the mother.
		Just a gut thing.  The way she
		deals with him.  It doesn't fit.
			(beat)
		Hard to say this early.  Could
		just be a child climbing a lot of
		trees.

	Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the
	check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly
	signs it.

			     MALCOLM
		I know I've been kind of out of it
		for a long while and you resent it.
		You do.  I know you're mad.  I know
		it's put some distance between us.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		But I'm getting a second chance
		here.  I can't let it slip away.

	Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes
	her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits
	alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		...Happy Anniversary.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the
	steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of
	a war.

	Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.
	Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.

	Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression.

			     COLE
		You want to ask me a question?

			     MALCOLM
		See, this is why I lose at poker.
		Yes, I do have a question.

	On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one
	side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points
	to them.

			     MALCOLM
		What happened to those two?  Being
		under tissue paper can't be a good
		thing.

	Cole removes the tissue.

			     COLE
		That's Private Jenkins and Private
		Kinney.  They got killed.  Private
		Jenkins has a baby girl that was
		born seven pounds, six ounces.
		He's never seen her.  He wanted to
		get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
		and hold her...

	Cole points to the other soldier.

			     COLE
		Private Kinney's wife is really
		sick -- she has something called a
		brain anism.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		You mean aneurysm.

			     COLE
		Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get
		back safe to take care of her.

	Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes.

			     COLE
		It's sad they died, isn't it?

	Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole
	wipes his eyes quickly.

			     COLE
		Don't look at me.
			(beat)
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

	Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression.

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Malcolm looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		Where should I look then, Cole?

			     COLE
		Look over there.

	Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.
	He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It's very unusual for someone your
		age to understand the kind of
		problems that Private Jenkins and
		Private Kinney have or even to be
		thinking about them at all...

	Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It is okay if I look back now?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     MALCOLM
		Tap the foot once for "No" and
		twice for "Yes."

	Cole taps his foot once.

	Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a
	while.

			     MALCOLM
		You wouldn't want to take a walk,
		would you?

	Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side
	of the street.

	Cole taps his foot twice.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park
	where children Cole's age are playing.

			     COLE
		I walk this way to school with
		Tommy Tammisimo.

			     MALCOLM
		He your best buddy?

	Cole almost smiles.

			     COLE
		He hates me.

			     MALCOLM
		You hate him?

	Cole shakes his head, "No.!

	Malcolm thinks for a bit.

			     MALCOLM
		Your mom set that up?

	Cole nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		You ever tell her about how it is
		with Tommy?

			     COLE
		I don't tell her a thing.

			     MALCOLM
		Why?

			     COLE
		Cause she doesn't look at me like
		everybody and I don't want her to.
		I don't want her to know.

			     MALCOLM
		Know what?

			     COLE
		That I'm a freak.

	Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		Listen to me.  You are not a freak.
		Don't you believe anybody that
		tells you that.  It's bullshit and
		you don't have to grow up believing
		that.

	Beat.  Cole is surprised.

			     COLE
		You said the "s" word.

			     MALCOLM
		Yeah.  Sorry.

	Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by
	Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at
	Malcolm with different eyes.

	They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move
	down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing
	at the gate of a brownstone.

			     COLE
		Is it okay if I do something?  I
		have to do something.

	Malcolm nods "yes" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they
	approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can
	barely see.

			     COLE
		Hi, Mr. Marschal.

	MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few
	seconds.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Guten Tag, Cole.

	Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down
	the block with a concerned expression.

			     COLE
		What's wrong?

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Mrs. Marschal.  She went food
		shopping.  She's running late.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Ich Habe Durst.

	Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to
		speak German?

			     COLE
		I just know a couple lines.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Yes, you may have a drink.  What
		would you like?

			     COLE
		Lemonade, please.

	Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.
	Cole turns back to Malcolm.

			     COLE
			(sad)
		Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

			     MALCOLM
		What about Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		She died a long time ago.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many
	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared
	by two people.

	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
	open door.

	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
	Cole with a crinkled brow.

	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Maybe Jill will play for us when
		she gets back.

	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of
	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

			     COLE
		Thank you.

	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally
	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...
	THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.
	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE
	POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole--

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		What's going on there?

	Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.

	Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to
	push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches
	over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

	Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They
	reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

	Malcolm becomes very still.

	Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.
	Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Is this for me?

	Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick
	glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his
	nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.

			MR. MASCHAL
		What's this?  Jill's keeping a
		diary.

	Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

	Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		She's full of surprises...

	He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at
	the final page of writing.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
			(whispers)
		She hasn't written anything for
		some time.

	Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up
	to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.

	Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They
	gently spill down his weathered face.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Oh no...

	Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The
	sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.

	Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.
	Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

	They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and
	brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

	Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares
	down at Cole in a daze.

	Cole turns his head, crying.

			     COLE
			(softly)
		Stop looking at me.

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a
	point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his
	mouth.

	CLICK.

			     MALCOLM
		April or March of Eighty-seven.
		Two weeks into sessions with
		Vincent Gray.  I was treating a
		couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,
		who had lost their child to
		Leukemia.  They were waiting with
		Vincent in the reception room of
		the downtown clinic.  They were
		alone together maybe fifteen
		minutes.  When I entered the room,
		all three were crying.  The
		Wagner's progress from that
		afternoon was dramatic and sudden
		....  As if some door had been
		opened for them.
			(beat)
		I'm not at all clear what happened
		in those fifteen minutes.  But I
		now believe Vincent tried to tell
		me something, show me something and
		I didn't listen.
			(beat)
		Cole Sear allowed me to witness
		something today.
			(beat)
		This time I'm going to listen.

	A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the
	thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter
	jacket in the house.

	Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The
	house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

	Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw
	something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN
	THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.

	She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts
	laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she
	HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF
	PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

	Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

	Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...
	Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a
	pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

	Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she
	notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo
	of three-year-old Cole.

	WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S
	FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE
	BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE
	SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.

	Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --
	Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the
	picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE
	LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.

	WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --
	SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN
	FINDS A BLUR.

	Lynn takes it all in curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on
	her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED
	TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's
	room.

	This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes
	and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The
	lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

	The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade
	tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and
	bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

	A sign hangs over the bedsheets.

		"DO NOT ENTER"

	Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

	A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts
	his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his
	slumber.

	Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under
	Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a
	couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a
	larger version of Cole.

	The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky
	breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

	Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll
	cover desk next to the bed.

	The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.
	Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

	Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit
	involuntarily.

	THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless
	lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...
	The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at
	great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --
	everything written in one continuous motion.

	Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

	...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is
	going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop
	the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

	The words go on and on.

	Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones
	off slowly.

	THE MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT FILLS THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE EERIE
	ROOM.

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den.

			     MALCOLM
		...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh
		with a lady who works in a toll
		booth.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		What if she has to pee when she's
		working?  You think she just holds
		it?
			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.  I was just thinking
		the same thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		You ask a lot of questions about my
		dad today.  How come?

	Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his
	head.

			     MALCOLM
		Sometimes, we don't even know it,
		but we do things to draw attention.
		Do things so we can express how we
		feel about issues...  Divorce or
		whatever.

	Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with
	peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out
	what he's doing.

			     MALCOLM
		One night, as an example...  leave
		something on a desk for someone to
		find.

	The top of Cole's head stops moving.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, have you ever heard of
		something called free-writing?  Or
		free-association writing?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's when you put a pencil in your
		hand and put the pencil to a paper
		and you just start writing...  You
		don't think about what you're
		writing...  You don't read over
		what you're writing...  You just
		keep your hand moving.

	Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		After awhile if you keep your hand
		moving long enough, words and
		thoughts start coming out you
		didn't even know you had in you...
		Sometimes they're things you heard
		from somewhere...  Sometimes
		they're feelings deep inside...
			(beat)
		Have you ever done any free-
		association writing, Cole?

	Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What'd you write?

			     COLE
		Words.

			     MALCOLM
		What kind of words?

			     COLE
		Upset words.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Did you ever write any upset words
		before your father left?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't remember.

	Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question
	off casually.

			     MALCOLM
		Can you do something for me?

	Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat.

			     MALCOLM
		Think about what you want from our
		time together.  What our goal
		should be?

			     COLE
		Something I want?

			     MALCOLM
		If we could change something in
		your life, anything at all, what
		would you like that to be?

	Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't have to answer now.

	Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind
	the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the
	ground like a dress.

			     COLE
		Instead of something I want, can I
		have something I don't want?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods "Yes."  Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't want to be scared anymore.

	Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.
	Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.

	He circles a phrase...

	"...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in
	fact, be self-inflicted."

	Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his
	head.

	ANNA'S MUFFLED VOICE CARRIES DOWN THE STAIRS.

	His face turns up to the ceiling.

			     MALCOLM
			(loud)
		Are you calling me?

	WE HEAR ANNA'S FOOTSTEPS MOVE ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING.  WE
	HEAR THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		What?  You don't see enough of me
		at the store?

	Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches
	his legs.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		On my way to the flea market in
		Amish country.  Thought maybe you
		want to come.  Show me how to buy
		at these things.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		I trust you...  Besides, I don't
		know if I'm up for the Amish today.
		You can't curse or spit or anything
		around them.

	Malcolm smiles at Anna.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I thought you'd want to get out.
		You've been kind of down.

	Malcolm slowly stops smiling.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		That's very sweet.  I'm okay.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Do you think I should stop by on my
		way back?  Show you what I got?
		It's not a problem.

	Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		You know that's probably not the
		best idea.  I'll just wait to see
		them in the store.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Okay.  Fine.  Understood.
			(beat)
		I'm off then.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		Don't step in the horse manure.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Thanks.

	WE HEAR THE FRONT DOOR SHUT.

	Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window.

	INT./EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - DAY

	We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.

	He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a
	moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel.

			     MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Give it up, kid.

	Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and
	pulls away from Malcolm's house.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

	STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a
	question on the board.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Can anyone guess what city was the
		capital of the United States of
		America from 1790 to 1800?

	Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine
	year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

	Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big
	eyes.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		...I'll give you a hint, it's the
		city you live in.

	The class says the answer in unison.

			     CLASS
		Philadelphia.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Right...  Philadelphia is one of
		the oldest cities in the country.
		A lot of generations have lived and
		died in this city...  Almost every
		place you visit has a history and a
		story behind it.
			(beat)
		Even this school and the grounds
		they sit on...  Can anyone guess
		what this building was used for a
		hundred years ago, before you went
		here, before I went to this school
		even?

	Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's
	just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.
	Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Yes, Cole?

			     COLE
		They used to hang people here.

	Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		That's not correct.  Where'd you
		hear that?

			     COLE
		They'd pull the people in crying
		and kissing their families bye...
		People watching would spit at them.

	Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
		Laws were passed here.  Some of the
		first laws of this country.  This
		building was full of lawyers.
		Lawmakers.

			     COLE
		They were the ones who hanged
		everybody.

	Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know which one of these
		guys told you that, but they were
		just trying to scare you, I think.

	Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.

	Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the
	teacher who is still staring.

			     COLE
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Like what?

			     COLE
		Stop it!

	Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and
	instantly stops smiling.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know how else to look--

			     COLE
		You're a stuttering Stanley!

	Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Excuse me?

			     COLE
		You talked funny when you went to
		school here.  You talked funny all
		the way to high school!

	The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an
	involuntary step towards Cole's desk.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		What--

			     COLE
		You shouldn't laugh at people.  It
		makes them feel bad.

	Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		How did you--?

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Cole covers his eyes with his hands.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who have you been s-speaking to?

	We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who!

	Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssstop that!

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssssstop it!

			     COLE
		Stuttering--

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

	MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop
	from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.

	The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.

	Cole's eyes are filled with tears.

	Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins
	to cry.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTHONY'S LIBRARY - SAME AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a
	long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his
	folded arms on the table.

	Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right
	place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a
	seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes
	are hard -- filled with anger.

			     MALCOLM
		Hey, big guy.

	Cole stares for a second.

			     COLE
		I don't want to talk about anything.

	Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.

	THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN
	THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

	Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in
	the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you like magic?

	Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks
	to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his
	right hand.

			     MALCOLM
		Watch the penny closely.

	Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

			     MALCOLM
		I do the magic shake...

	Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		And suddenly the penny has
		magically traveled to my left hand...

	Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open
	it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's not the end of the trick.
		With another magic shake, the penny
		travels into my shirt pocket...

	Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but
	doesn't open it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's still not the end!...  I
		do a final magic shake...  and
		suddenly...  The penny returns to
		the hand where it started from.

	Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the
	center of his palm.

	Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.
	Cole cracks a smile.

			     COLE
		That isn't magic.

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		You just kept the penny in that
		hand the whole time...

			     MALCOLM
		Who me?

	Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the
	table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		I didn't know you were funny.

			     MALCOLM
		I forgot myself.

	Malcolm and Cole share a warm look.

	THE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME
	POURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.

	Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the
	windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...

	Cole looks at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		One day...
			(beat)
		You're going to sound just like
		them.

	Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Promise?

	Beat.

		Promise.

	Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF
	CHILDREN PLAYING.

		Malcolm, sit your cute butt down

		Are you listening?

	Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty
	living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the
	sofa.

	THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.
	IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.  A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS
	HOLDING THE MICROPHONE.   IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE
	FLOOR.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		No doubt about it.  Anna's like my
		sister.  You better make her happy...
		And I'm not talking about -- mmm
		this tastes like real butter --
		kind of happy...  I'm talking about
		Julie Andrews twirling around like
		a mental patient on a mountain top
		-- kind of happy.

	THE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		You're really lucky.  She's got so
		much love for you.  Don't tell her
		I told you, but she said she loved
		you from the first time she met you
		on the street.  She'd do anything
		for you.
			(crying)
		I love you guys.
			(more crying)
		My nose is running.  Why isn't
		someone getting me a tissue?

	THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN.  THE CAMERA
	PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR.  MALCOLM AND
	ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH
	OTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.
	He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm moves into their bedroom.

	THE SOUND OF A SHOWER CAN BE HEARD FROM THE BATHROOM.

	Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the
	silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.
	Anna stands still, her head tilted back.

	Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's
	taken by his wife's beauty.

	Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the
	sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble
	surface.

	He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle
	reads,

		"Zoloft Anti-depressant"
		"To be taken twice daily"

	Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the
	still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

	Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise
	with the door as he closes it shut.

	EXT. DARREN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey

	INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

	Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining
	table covered in colorful paper.  A stack of birthday presents
	are sitting on the table next to a cake.

	The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND
	LAUGHING.

	Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.
	Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in
	circles in the air.

			     COLE
		...Then you do the magic shake.
		And now the penny moves from my
		pocket all the way to the hand it
		started in.

	Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal
	the penny.

	Bobby stares.

			     BOBBY
		That's stupid.

	Cole loses his smile.

			     COLE
		It's supposed to be funny.

			     BOBBY
		It's stupid.

	Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other.

			     BOBBY
		Give me my penny back.

	Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby.

			     COLE
			(almost inaudible)
		...Don't be sad.

	Bobby looks up sharply.

			     BOBBY
			(hard)
		What'd you say?

	Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his
	tattered napkin.

	INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open

	DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.
	Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic
	heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit.

		party a year ago.  He hid in one of
		those purple plastic tunnels and
		didn't come out.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		Chuck E. who?

			     LYNN
		Cheese.  It's a kid's place.

	Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering
	people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling
	silver trays.

			     LYNN
		He's my whole life.

	Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face.

			     LYNN
		I work at an insurance place and at
		Penny's, so Cole can go to that
		good school.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		J. C. Jenny's?

	Lynn nods "Yes."

			     DARREN'S MOM
			(bullshit)
		Good for you.

			     LYNN
		I wish I could be like my momma
		though.  She always knew what was
		wrong.  Knew just what to say.

	Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch.

			     LYNN
		Cole's going through something bad.
		He won't talk to me.
			(beat)
		I'm his momma.
			(emotional)
		And I don't know what's wrong and
		I don't know what to say.

	Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen
	with sad eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors
	d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway.

			     MRS. WESTON
		Did you have the Brie?

			     MRS. SAUNDERS
		It tasted like cheese whiz.

	They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.
	The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.

	Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as
	he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's
	eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.

	THE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE
	BACKYARD.

	Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the
	birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat.

			     TOMMY
		I even got a trailer.

			     DARREN
		For what?  You only had one line.

			     TOMMY
		You're slow, you know that.  The
		star of the commercial always has
		his own trailer.  You need to think
		about your character alone.

	Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring
	at the crawl space closet.

	Tommy grabs Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Darren, check it out.

	     DARREN looks down the hall to Cole.

			     DARREN
		My dad made me invite him.

	Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his
	trance as Tommy and Darren walk up.

			     COLE
		Happy birthday, Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Something you want to see in there?

	Tommy points to the crawl space.

			     COLE
			(too quick)
		--No.

	Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole.

			     TOMMY
		We're going to put on a pretend
		play.  You want to be in it?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		...Okay.

			     TOMMY
		It's called, "Locked in the Dungeon."

	Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it.

			     DARREN
		Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the
		one locked in the dungeon.

	It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove
	Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space.

			     COLE
		Don't!

	Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack
	smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

	The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

	SILENCE.

	Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl
	space door.

	Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

	Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN
	TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against
	the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES
	like it's going to break off its hinges.

	The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE
	HALLWAY.

	FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down
	the hall.  Lynn is one of them.

	Darren's mother turns the corner.

			     DARREN'S MOTHER
		Who's making that noise?

	She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH
	THE HALL.

			     LYNN
		Cole!

	Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The
	door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's
	UNCONSCIOUS.

	Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside
	except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.
	She turns around with Cole in her arms.

			     LYNN
			(desperate whispers)
		Help me get him in the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

	Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception
	area.

	A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.

	Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game
	made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.

	A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.
	He opens up his notes.

			     LYNN
		What's wrong with Cole?

	Beat.

			     DR. HILL
		The tests indicate he did not have
		a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.
		After some rest, he could go home
		tonight.

	Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm
	eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman
	standing at the reception room door.

			     MALCOLM
		There's something else going on,
		Lynn.

	Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

			     DR. HILL
		There are some scratches and
		bruises on your son that concern me.

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, man.

			     LYNN
		Those are from sports, from playing.
		He's not the most coordinated kid,
		but I don't want him to stop trying,
		you know what I mean?

	Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway.

			     DR. HILL
		Mrs. Sloan over there is our social
		worker at the hospital.  She's
		going to ask you some procedural
		questions.

			     LYNN
		You think I hurt my child?
			(emotional)
		You think I'm a bad mother?

			     DR. HILL
		At this point it's just procedure.
		And you should probably calm down.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you expect her to react?

			     LYNN
		You want me to answer your
		questions?

			     DR. HILL
			(sarcastic)
		I'm sorry if I was being vague --
		yes, I do.

			     LYNN
		Who's going to answer mine, you
		dick.

	Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files.

			     LYNN
			(raising voice)
		What happened to my child today?

	Dr. Hill gets up.

			     LYNN
		Something was happening to him --
		physically happening.  Something
		was very wrong.

	Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception
	room without looking back.

	Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks
	up to the table and waits.

	Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable
	strength.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		How long will these questions take?

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him
	as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

	Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.
	Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes.

			     MALCOLM
		I've decided we shouldn't schedule
		sessions anymore.  I'll just follow
		you around.

	Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal
	chair.

	Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital
	gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride
	up all the way to his knees.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father ever tell you bedtime
		stories?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in
	the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Once upon a time there was a prince,
		who was being driven around...  He
		drove around for a long, long time...
		Driving and driving...  It was a
		long trip...  He fell asleep...
			(beat)
		When he woke up, they were still
		driving...  The long drive went on--

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You haven't told bedtime stories
		before?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		You have to add some twists and
		stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas.

			     MALCOLM
		No gas...  Hey, that's good.

	They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head.

			     COLE
		Tell me a story about why you're
		sad.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you think I'm sad?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What makes you think that?

			     COLE
		Your eyes told me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client.

			     MALCOLM
			(rote)
		I'm not supposed to talk about
		stuff like that.

	Cole smiles softly.

	Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the
	hospital bed.

	Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.

	Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed.

			     MALCOLM
		...Once upon a time there was this
		person named Malcolm.  He worked
		with children.  Loved it more than
		anything.
			(smiles)
		Then one night, he finds out he
		made a mistake with one of them.
		Didn't help that one at all.  He
		thinks about that one a lot.  Can't
		forget.
			(beat)
		Ever since then, things have been
		different.  He's become messed up.
		Confused.  Angry.  Not the same
		person he used to be.
			(beat)
		His wife doesn't like the person
		he's become.  They don't speak
		anymore.  They're like strangers.

	Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches
	him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		And then one day this person
		Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who
		reminds him of that one.  Reminds
		him a lot of that one.  Malcolm
		decides to try to help this new boy.
		He thinks maybe if he can help this
		boy, it would be like helping that
		one too.

	Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how the story ends.
		I hope it's a happy ending.

			     COLE
		Me too.

	Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a
	long time.

	EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID FROM THIS POINT ON IS WHISPERED.

			     COLE
		I want to tell you my secret now.

	Malcolm blinks very slowly.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay.

	Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both.

			     COLE
		...I see people.

	Malcolm just gazes quietly.

			     COLE
		I see dead people...  Some of them
		scare me.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		In your dreams?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		When you're awake?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		Dead people, like in graves and
		coffins?

			     COLE
		No, walking around, like regular
		people...  They can't see each
		other.  Some of them don't know
		they're dead.

			     MALCOLM
		They don't know they're dead?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I see ghosts.

	Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.
	He and Cole stare at each other a long time.

			     COLE
		They tell me stories...  Things
		that happened to them...  Things
		that happened to people they know.

	Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing.

			     MALCOLM
		How often do you see them?

			     COLE
		All the time.  They're everywhere.
			(beat)
		You won't tell anyone my secret,
		right?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		...No.

			     COLE
		Will you stay here till I fall
		asleep?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and
	turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and
	stares at Cole.

	MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find
	nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

	COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY...  WE MOVE IN ON THEM --
	TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.

	Beat.

	And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital
	room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.
	Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are
	patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN
	HOSPITAL GOWNS...  SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

	THEY STAND UNNATURALLY STILL IN THEIR WINDOWS...  WATCHING,
	WAITING.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

	Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his
	thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR
	SUDDENLY EMERGES FROM THE STEAM, NARROWLY MISSING MALCOLM.

	Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.
	His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches
	down and picks it up.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...
			(beat)
		His pathology is more severe than
		initially assessed.
			(beat)
		He's suffering from visual
		hallucinations, paranoia --
		Symptoms of some kind of school age
		Schizophrenia.
			(beat)
		Medication and hospitalization may
		be required.

	CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm not helping him.

	Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash
	like thunder in his head.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in
	silence.  She glances down to her right.

	Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his
	regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks
	like a four-year-old.

	The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.

	Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's
	head as she drives.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her
	shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.

	Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd
	Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

	Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is
	curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He
	looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's
	sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to
	fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the
	fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the
	middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn
	pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL
	LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

	Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as
	she moves into her room and closes the door.

	WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole's
		mother.  I wonder if we could
		talk about your son and his
		friends keeping their goddamn
		hands off my boy?

	The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too
	still.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT


	An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.

	The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees.

	A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.

	The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan
	the darkness.

	The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed
	together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves
	cautiously into the hall.

	Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens
	it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.

	He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and
	pees into the toilet.

	A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.

	Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He
	slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his
	pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.
	He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.
	HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

	Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a
	SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

	Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down
	the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway
	of the kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.
	Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Momma?
			(beat)
		Dream about daddy again?

	The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The
	woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her
	forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER.

			     WOMAN
		DINNER'S -- NOT -- READY!

	Cole's face turns the color of ash.

			     WOMAN
		What are you going to do?

	Cole backs up to the doorway.

			     WOMAN
		You can't hurt me anymore!


	The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...
	They've been savagely cut.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Cole turns and runs down the hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs across his room.

	He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with
	the "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs
	disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.

	The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any
	closer.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment
	reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.

	The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

	It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined
	with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of
	saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole
	stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary
	made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - AFTERNOON

	THE LIGHTS IN THE GYM GO DOWN.  THE SPOT LIGHT OPENS ON THE STAGE
	AS THE CURTAINS MOVE TO THE SIDES...

	A sign to the side of the stage reads, "The third and fourth
	grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book."

	The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a
	villager's outfit.

			     TOMMY
			(Decent British accent)
		There once was a boy, very
		different than other boys.  He
		lived in the jungle, and he could
		talk with the animals.

	BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children.

	THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS THE FULL CAST OF THE ACTORS COME OUT.
	Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.

	Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.

	MALCOLM APPLAUDS FROM THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

	The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted
	drawings and test papers.

	Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall.

			     COLE
		Did you think the play sucked big
		time?

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough
		syrup commercial.  He thought
		everybody was self-conscious and
		unrealistic.  He said the play
		sucked big time.

			     MALCOLM
		I know every child is special in
		their own way, but Tommy sounds
		like a punk.
			(Cole smiles)
		I thought the play was excellent.
		Better than Cats.

			     COLE
		Cats?

			     MALCOLM
		Never mind.

	Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his
	time.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, I was really interested in
		what you told me in the hospital,
		I'd like to hear more about it.

	Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --
	realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find
	Cole frozen about ten feet back.

	Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets
	closer.

			     MALCOLM
		What's wrong?

	Cole points to the doors.

			     MALCOLM
		Is something in there?

	Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

	It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood
	beamed ceiling.

	Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		What is it?

	Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Be real still.

	Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.
	Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Sometimes you feel it inside.
		Like you're falling down real fast,
		but you're really just standing
		still.

	Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes.

			     COLE
		You ever feel prickly things on the
		back of your neck?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes?

			     COLE
		And the tiny hairs on your arm.
		Are they all standing up?

	Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face.

			     MALCOLM
		-- Yes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		When they get mad, it gets cold.

			     MALCOLM
		Them?

	Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.

	Nothing is said for a few moments.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see anything.
			(beat)
		Are you sure they're there?
			(beat)
		Cole?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his
	eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately.

			     COLE
		Please make them leave.

	Malcolm stares helplessly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm working on it.

	Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs.

	COLE GLANCES BACK AS HE MOVES OUT OF THE STAIRWELL.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top
	of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES
	HANGING BY THEIR NECKS FROM A WOODEN BEAM.

	It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no
	shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN
	in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to
	the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to
	their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with
	their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in
	front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.
	Night time has fallen over the city.

	He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds
	his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his
	arm's surface.

	Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill
	the corners of the historic building...

	Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...Is anyone there?

	A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then
	becomes still.

	Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his
	pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to
	his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED
	VOICES SPILL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Look, he's an eight-year-old child.
		He's my only client.  If he invites
		me to his play, I'm not thinking
		about how late I get back...  I go.
		I have to go.  You know that.
		That's the only way I know how to
		work.
			(beat)
		Vincent said I failed him.
			(raising his voice)
		I WON'T GIVE COLE A CHANCE TO SAY
		THOSE WORDS TO ME!  I WON'T!

	Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Please let it ring.

	WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She
	wipes her tears.

	She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

	Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.

	ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

			     ANNA
		I can't talk now.

	Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on
	the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the
	basement door again.

			     ANNA
			(whispers)
		I thought about you too.

	Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.
	Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm.

			     LYNN
		I don't care what they say, this
		thing is definitely broken.

	Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up
	twelve inch kitchen T.V.

	ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his
	pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs.

			     TOMMY
			(on T.V.)
		Mommy, my throat hurts.

	Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a
	spoonful of medicine.

			     NARRATOR
			(on T.V.)
		Pediaease Cough Suppressant...
		gentle, fast, effective.

	Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the
	very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to
	the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole
	throws his shoe at the power button.

	He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.
	His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's
	extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill
	the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk
	glass with the gloves.

			     LYNN
		Take 'em off.

	Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his
	plate.

			     LYNN
		I don't want them on my table.

	Cole moves them to the floor.

	Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.

	Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		I saw what was in your bureau
		drawer when I was cleaning.

	Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		You got something you want to
		confess?

	Cole just stares.

			     LYNN
		The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you
		keep taking it?

	Cole looks down at his lap.

			     LYNN
		It was Grandma's.  It's not for
		playing.
			(beat)
		What if it broke?  You know how sad
		I'd be.

			     COLE
		You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma
		so much.

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		That's right.  So why do you take
		it, sweetheart?

			     COLE
		Sometimes people think they lose
		things and they didn't really lose
		them.  It just gets moved.

			     LYNN
		Did you move the bumble bee pendant?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."  Lynn just stares.

			     LYNN
		You didn't take it before.  You
		didn't take it the time after that.
		And now, you didn't take it again?

			     COLE
		Don't get mad.

			     LYNN
		So who moved it?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		There's only two of us.
			(beat)
		Maybe someone came in our house --
		took the bumble bee pendant out of
		my closet, and then laid it nicely
		in your drawer?
			(beat)
		Is that what happened?

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Maybe.

	Lynn just stares at Cole.

			     LYNN
		I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in
		my body.  I'm tired in my mind.
		I'm tired in my heart.  I need a
		little help here.
			(beat)
		I don't know if you noticed -- but
		our little family isn't doing so
		good.

	Lynn folds her napkin quietly.

			     LYNN
		I'm praying for us, but I must not
		be praying right.
			(beat)
		It looks like we're just going to
		have to answer each other's prayers.
		If we can't talk to each other --
		we're not going to make it.
			(beat)
		Now baby, tell me...  I won't be
		mad, honey...  Did you take the
		bumble bee pendant?

	Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up.

			     COLE
		No.

	Lynn goes cold.

			     LYNN
		You've had enough roast beef.  You
		need to leave the table.

	Cole just stares at his mother's expression.

			     LYNN
			(yells)
		Go!

	Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and
	leaves the room.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF
	HIS PUPPY GROWLING.

	Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.
	Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a
	couch.

	Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

	THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  IT'S
	ALMOST SHUT.  COLE WATCHES AS THE DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN VERY
	SLOWLY.  IT OPENS WIDE.  COLE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH.

	SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE
	SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.
	IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

	Cole stops breathing.

	THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

	IT'S A BOY.  A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

	THE BOY WHISPERS IN A LOW, HOARSE VOICE.

			     BOY
		Come on...  I'll show you where my
		dad keeps his gun...  Come on.

	THE BOY TURNS.  WE SEE THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IS MISSING AS HE
	DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

	Cole is too terrified to move.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy
	out of the broom closet.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		Momma.

	Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are
	red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her
	hand.

	Mother and son look at each other.  Beat.

			     COLE
		If you're not very mad...  Can I
		sleep in your room tonight?

	Lynn fights back some tears.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face, Cole.

	Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son.

			     LYNN
		I'm not very mad.

	Lynn hugs him.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Baby...  Why are you shaking?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's wrong?

	Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight.

			     LYNN
			(desperate)
		...Please tell me.

	Cole doesn't say a word.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Please.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with
	furniture and knickknacks.

	Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer
	into a glass cabinet.

	An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

			     ANNA
		It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.
		Entirely platinum with a mine cut
		diamond and an actual color Burmese
		Sapphire...  It's timeless.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You got anything a little plainer?

	The young woman looks at her beau.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Plainer?  You want a plain ring to
		go with your plain fiance.  Is that
		how it is?

			     YOUNG MAN
		No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.
		It's just...  you're so beautiful...
		you're like a Burmese Sapphire all
		by yourself.  You don't need all
		that.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
			(disbelief)
		Uh-huh.

	Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.

			     ANNA
		Why don't you two hold it?

	She places it in their hands.

			     ANNA
		Do you feel longing?

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Excuse me?

			     ANNA
		When I touch this piece I feel a
		longing.  I imagine the woman who
		owned this, loved a man deeply she
		couldn't be with.

	The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Did he have wavy hair and broad
		shoulders?

	The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.

			     ANNA
		I don't know...  But maybe...
			(beat)
		A lot of the pieces in this store
		give me feelings.  I think maybe
		when people own things and then
		they pass away -- a part of
		themselves gets printed on those
		things -- like fingerprints.

	Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.

	They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it
	reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.

	Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying
	an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much
	needed seat.

			     SEAN
		You don't need someone with a
		masters.  You need a wrestler guy
		whose neck is larger than his head.

			     ANNA
		I need a wrestler with a masters.

	Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.

			     SEAN
		What's this?

	Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a
	BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her.

			     SEAN
		From you?

	Anna nods, "yes."

			     SEAN
		Is it wrestling tights?

	Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off
	the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.

	Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE
	GREAT GATSBY."  Beat.

			     ANNA
		It's a first edition.

			     SEAN
		Wow, this is too much.  It's
		perfect, Anna.

	Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,
	still holding her.  They smile at each other.

	Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second
	too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold
	each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.


	CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna
	and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the
	young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front
	door cracked in a spider web pattern.

	They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.
	Look around.   No one in sight.

	Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her
	face.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand
	goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

	Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.

	Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.

	Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.

	Beat.

	Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

	She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts
	as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is
	smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the
	air like he's on a roller coaster.

	Beat.

	They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn
	leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

	Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A
	little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries
	into the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - DAY

	Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

	Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.

	Lynn looks over.

			     LYNN
		Let's rent a movie.

	Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.

			     LYNN
		Your pick.

	Cole stares at his mom quietly.

			     LYNN
		It can even have Jean Claude Van
		Damme in it if you want.

	Cole smiles at that.  He nods, "Yes" joyfully.

	His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the
	HEATER controls.

	Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

	Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page
	from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a
	woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks
	into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl
	in the air.

			     COLE
			(yells)
		Momma, look out!

	The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her
	stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.

	Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

	Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.

	THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR...  HER TERROR-
	STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE
	WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...

	COLE SCREAMS.  LYNN SCREAMS...  THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN
	THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

	The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve
	to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the
	entire intersection has come to a halt.

	Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.

	He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No
	broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through
	the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped
	and staring all around them.

	Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at
	him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.
	The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why
	he screamed.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-
	colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --
	arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --
	eyes peering out over his arms.

	They both look like shit.

			     COLE
		You don't wanna ask me questions
		today?

	Malcolm nods, "No."  Beat.

			     COLE
		Can I ask you then?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		What do you want more than anything?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.

			     COLE
		I told you what I want.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know, Cole.

			     COLE
		Why don't you think about it for a
		while?

	Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I know what I want.
			(beat)
		My goal is to speak to my wife.
		The way she and I used to speak.
		Like there was no one in the world
		but us.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		How are you going to do that?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I can't be your doctor anymore.
			(beat)
		I haven't given my family enough
		attention.  Bad things happen when
		you do that.  Do you understand?

	The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft.

			     COLE
		You want to go home?

	Malcolm stares across at Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		I have to.

			     COLE
		When?

			     MALCOLM
		Soon.  One week.

	Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm going to transfer you.  I know
		two psychologists that are
		exceptional--

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Don't fail me.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

			     MALCOLM
		--What?

			     COLE
		Don't give up.  You're the only one
		who can help me.  I know it.

	Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to know a secret?...  I
		was a paper champion.
			(beat)
		Do you know what that means?

	Cole shake his head, "No."  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks.

			     COLE
		Don't cry.

			     MALCOLM
		I means I wasn't what everyone
		thought I was...
			(beat)
		I was a fake.

			     COLE
		You weren't a paper champion.

			     MALCOLM
		Someone else can help you.  Someone
		else can make you happy.

	Cole is crying now.

	Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare
	at each other.  Beat.

	Cole whispers.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You believe me, right?

	A long pause.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,
		right?

	They both just stare.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how to answer that.

	Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.
	It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down.

			     COLE
		How can you help me if you don't
		believe me?

	Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.

	Cole pushes it across the table.

	Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Some magic's real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes
	gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.

	Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the
	shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.

	Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's
	eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the
	label...

	"SESSION TAPES -- VINCENT GRAY"

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.
	Malcolm hits play.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING IS HEARD.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Sorry about that.  Hope I didn't
		leave you alone too long...  Wow,
		it's cold in here.

	WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent...  Why are you crying?
			(beat)
		Vincent?

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOICE ANSWERS.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape crying)
		Yes?

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What happened?
			(beat)
		Did something upset you?

	Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		You won't believe.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I won't believe what?

	Beat.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		I don't want to talk anymore.  I
		want to go home, okay?  I want to
		go home.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Okay, Vincent, you can go home.

	CLICK.  THE TAPE GOES TO SILENCE.

	Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a
	while.

	Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--about that.  Hope I didn't leave
		you too long...  Wow, it's cold in
		here--

	Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a
	while.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--like needles either.  When I was
		a kid, I had this blood test down --
		threw up chill cheese fries all
		over this male nurse.

	WE HEAR VINCENT CHUCKLE SOFTLY.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING IS HEARD.

			     SECRETARY
			(on tape)
		Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line
		two.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent, I have to take this.  Give
		me a minute.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		Okay.

	FOOTSTEPS AS MALCOLM AND THE SECRETARY LEAVE THE ROOM.  THE DOOR
	CLOSES.  AND THE SILENCE.

	Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR
	SCREECH ACROSS THE FLOOR.  VINCENT'S BREATHING QUICKENS.

	A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

	Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins
	in the player.

	Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up.
	THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

	Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and
	listens...  Beat.

	DEEP IN THE STATIC...  ANOTHER SOUND EMERGES, WHISPERING.

	A MAN'S VOICE IS HEARD IN THE ROOM WITH VINCENT

			     MAN'S WHISPERING
			(on tape)
		Familia...  No dejen que esto me
		pase...  Mi familia...  Yo no
		quiero morir...  Familia...

	Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief.

			     MALCOLM
		...Jesus Christ.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay
	window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

	Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of
	older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating
	sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a
	story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when
	he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he
	saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than
	the next.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.
	His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

	Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his
	hand to his side as he winces a bit.

	Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on
	the bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

			     MALCOLM
		Hello again.

	He looks down and studies Malcolm.

			     COLE
		You been running around?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."

			     COLE
		It makes you feel better?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes" again.

			     COLE
		I like to run around.  It's good
		exercise.
			(beat)
		You want to ask me questions now?

	Malcolm shakes his head, "No."

			     COLE
		You want to be a lance corporal in
		Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th
		Marines?  We're being dispatched to
		the Quang Nam province.

	Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he
	understands now.


			     MALCOLM
		Maybe later.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Something happened, didn't it?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, it did.

			     COLE
		Are you wigging out?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, I am.

			     COLE
		We're not gonna start crying again,
		are we?

			     MALCOLM
		No, we're not.

			     COLE
		What happened?

	Beat.

	Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		These people...  People that died
		and are still hanging around.
		Maybe they weren't ready to go.

	Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face.

			     COLE
		You really look better.

			     MALCOLM
		 Maybe they wake up that morning
		 thinking they have a thousand
		 things to do and a thousand days
		 left to do them in...  And then
		 all of a sudden, it's all taken
		 away.  No one asked them.  It's
		 just gone...

			     COLE
		You have nice red in your cheeks now.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you know what 'Yo no quiero
		morir' is?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's Spanish.  It means...  'I
		don't want to die.'
			(beat)
		Not all the ghosts are scary, are
		they?  Like Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
		No.

			     MALCOLM
		What do those ghosts want when they
		talk to you?  Think real careful
		now, Cole...

	Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just help.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes!  I think that's right!...  I
		think they all want that.  Even the
		scary ones...

			     COLE
		You believe now?

	Malcolm's stare is unwavering.

			     MALCOLM
		I believe both of you now.
			(beat)
		And I think I might know how to
		make them go away.

			     COLE
		You do?

	Malcolm nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		I think they know you're one of
		those guys rare people can see them.
			(beat)
		You need to help them.  Each one of
		them.
			(beat)
		Everyone wants to be heard.
		Everyone.

	Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

			     COLE
		What if they don't want help?  What
		if they're just angry and they want
		to hurt somebody?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't think that's the way it
		works, Cole.

	Cole looks nervous.

			     COLE
		How do you know for sure?

	Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under
	his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't.

	Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back
	of the church.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges
	with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a
	complete stop.

	Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his
	house is SEAN.

	Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the
	front stairs and starts across the street.

	A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

	Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure
	closing in on him.

	THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean
	pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

	Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and
	overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm stands in his foyer.

	Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away
	from the front.

	Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the
	phone.

			     ANNA
		...You just walked out.  You're
		probably on your way home.  I'm
		leaving this message...  I just
		didn't get to say what I meant...
			(beat)
		I know you're confused.  It's just...
		I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.
			(beat)
		I don't want to be ashamed of that.
		I don't want to have to make
		excuses for that.
			(beat)
		And I wanted to tell you...  I
		bought your present wholesale from
		a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on
		it.  You don't need someone cheap
		like that.
			(beat)
		By the way, it's a non-refundable
		item, it's scratched on the bottom.
			(beat)
		Are you smiling?...  I hope you're
		smiling.
			(beat)
		I'll see you at the store.

	Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.

	Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.

	His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE
	STAIRS.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	The house is silent.  No movement.

	Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.

	Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by
	statues and pictures.

	Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

			     LYNN
		Cole...
			(beat)
		Cole, what's happening...

	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
	folds to the ground.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
	open his mother's bedroom door.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
	machine fills the other side of the room.

	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's happening to you?

	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

			     LYNN
		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll
		beat their asses.

	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
	face with his tiny fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Momma, you sleep now.

	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her
	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

							COT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands
	still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

	HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

	Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time
	intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the
	suddenly ice cold air.

	Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He
	takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the
	hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in
	a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before
	entering the tent.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

	AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She
	finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --
	tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he
	tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living
	room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-
	legged couch.

	Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole
	presses as far back as he can and waits.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.
	Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

	Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He
	takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign
	of movement.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He
	stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

	BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --
	fights it back.

	He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off
	the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at
	Cole.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better.

	Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole
	holds her stare with trembling eyes.

	He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out.

			     COLE
		Do you want to tell me something?

							CUT TO:

	INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

	A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the
	spattering of passengers.

	They're both wearing suits.

	Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.
	Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an
	entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM
	WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL
	WEEDS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  HE HOBBLES HIS WAY DESPERATELY
	TOWARDS THE BUS.  HIS HANDS AND LEGS ARE SHACKLED...  HE LUNGES
	OUT FOR COLE IN THE PASSING WINDOW.

			     SHACKLED MAN
		My name's not Sullivan!

	A GUNSHOT ECHOES IN THE AIR.  THE MAN'S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED AS
	HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES SCREAMING.

	Cole jerks back from the window.

	The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.

	Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		She came a long way to visit me,
		didn't she?

			     MALCOLM
		I guess she did.

	Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress
	shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.

	The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets
	working its way downtown.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed
	carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto
	the streets.

	People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the
	front door of the home.

	Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards
	the doors.

	A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress
	on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her
	as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

			     MALCOLM
		Her little sister?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others
	into the modest corner home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is
	standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED
	CONVERSATIONS.

			     VISITOR #1
		...can you imagine being a child in
		a bed for two years?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #2
		...I think it was six.

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #3
		...Six separate doctors?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #4
			(whispers)
		...the little one's falling ill now...

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #5
		...God help them...

	A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one
	bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother
	and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

	Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
	Waiting.

	The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to
	Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear
	upstairs.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.
	stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being
	taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.

	Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His
	eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
	hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		I wish I were somewhere else.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		Where will you go, where no one has
		died?

	Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Don't go home, okay?

			     MALCOLM
		I definitely won't.

	Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time
	before reaching for the doorknob.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the
	girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The
	walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
	friends, and school children.

	Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of
	puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
	a mini tripod sitting next to it.

	Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He
	places it in his pocket.

	On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
	The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
	Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

	Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
	closets.  He passes the bed.

	AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS
	COLE'S ANKLE.

	Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips
	back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing
	happens.

	He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his
	head and looks under the bed.

	The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
	floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.
	Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor
	and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at
	each other.  Neither of them say a word.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the
	GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves
	through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
	hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins
	leaves the living room.

	Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
	through the many adults across the room.

	The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
	is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is
	granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares
	statue-like at an abstract point in the room.

			     COLE
		Mister?

	The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the
	little boy standing before the man.

			     COLE
		Excuse me, Mister.

	Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing
	next to him.  Cole is very shaky.

	Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

	Cole stares at Mr. Collins.

			     COLE
		Are you Kyra's daddy?

	The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

	Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.

	The father just stares at it.  Beat.

			     COLE
		It's for you...
			(beat)
		She wanted to tell you something.

	The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of
	confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches
	and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

	Cole begins to back away...

	The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole
	reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

	The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry
	box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch
	and open the box.

	Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.
	Collins is seated now.

	THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE.
	TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE.  WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE
	PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.

	Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he
	watches the performance.

	The entire room has stopped what they were doing.

	T.V. SCREEN

	WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.
	The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.
	We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her
	desk in the corner.

	Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door
	opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a
	sandwich.

	LIVING ROOM

	The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his
	eyes off of the screen.

	The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the
	fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.

	And then it happens.

	The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An
	assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
	She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the
	ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the
	cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.
	Checks it.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		That's too much.

	The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into
	the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back
	in the closet.

	The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She
	places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over
	the bed.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Kyra, time for lunch.

	Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The image of the mother smiles.

			     MRS. COLLINGS
			(video tape)
		I'm glad, honey.
			(beat)
		Time for your food.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		Can I go outside, if I eat this?

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		We'll see.  You know how you get
		sick in the afternoon.

	Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at
	the taste.  She looks up at her mother.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Don't say it tastes funny.  You
		know I don't like to hear that.

	Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another
	spoonful.

	The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He
	presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.

	The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends
	and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the
	table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.

	She looks up.

	Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A
	group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.

	Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.

	Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

			     MR. COLLINS
			(soft)
		You were keeping her sick...

	The whole world stops.

	The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow
	realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.

	She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage
	filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his
	cheeks.

	Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She
	concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to
	shake.


			     MRS. COLLINS
			(to no one)
		I took care of her...

	Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream
	down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand
	tumble to the floor.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She
	doesn't look up.

	Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

	Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER
	PUPPET.  He holds it out.

			     COLE
		You liked it, she said.

	The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes
	it in her small hands.

	The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances
	to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has
	ceased.

	Cole turns to the four-year-old.

			     COLE
		She watched out for you.

	The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

			FOUR YEAR OLD
		Kyra's not coming back.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Not anymore.

	The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly
	places a hand on her shoulder.

	Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

	Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One
	mourning.  One consoling.

	Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop
	room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and
	then knocks.  After a second, he enters.

	Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a
	FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.
	Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		They're calling for the stable boy.

	Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who were you talking to?

	The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		Poor Stanley.

	She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt
	horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		My favorite student.

	THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN MOVES PAST MR. CUNNINGHAM IN THE DOORWAY.
	SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

	Cole puts on his tattered hat.

			     COLE
		Thanks for giving me this part, Mr.
		Cunningham.

	Mr. Cunningham smiles.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You're welcome, Cole.

	They share a look before walking out of the prop room and
	entering the hall.

	We see them walking away.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You know when I was in school,
		there was a terrible fire in this
		section of the theater.  They
		rebuilt the whole thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I know.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he
	scurries up the stairs of the school.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.
	Anthony's Academy.

	A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

			     MALCOLM
		Has the play started yet?

	The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying
	a word.

			     MALCOLM
		Is that a yes?

	The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her
	curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.
	He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

	The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed
	children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down
	costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

	A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
	where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE
	sticks out of the top.

	The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

	Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's
	costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

			     MERLIN
		Only he who is pure of heart can
		take the sword from the stone.

	Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

			     MERLIN
		Let the boy try.

	The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

	Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops
	around, clearly embarrassed.

			     TOMMY
			(half-heartedly)
		But he's the stable boy.  He cleans
		after the horses.

			     MERLIN
		Silence village idiot!  Let the boy
		step forward.

	Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

	Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

			     MERLIN
		Arthur...

	Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.
	It takes him a moment before he steps forward.

	Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the
	handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

	The villagers GASP.

	Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his
	head.

	Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE
	AUDITORIUM.

	Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light
	for the first time.

	The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry
	him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then
	starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try
	unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then
	collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle
	themselves.

	Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable
	among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying
	themselves on stage.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

	The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass
	window.

	Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and
	forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

			     COLE
		How come we're so quiet?

	Malcolm shrugs his shoulders.

			     MALCOLM
		I think we said everything we
		needed to say.
			(beat)
		Maybe it's time to say things to
		someone else?  Someone close to you?

			     COLE
		Maybe.

	Cole keeps moving.  Beat.

			     COLE
		I'm not going to see you anymore,
		am I?

	Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, "No."
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You were great in the play, Cole.

			     COLE
		Really?

			     MALCOLM
		And you know what else?

			     COLE
		What?

			     MALCOLM
		Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

	Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he
	continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't
	want to be still.

			     COLE
		...Maybe we can pretend we're going
		to see each other tomorrow?

	Cole glances at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just for pretend.

	Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.
	Cole stops moving.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		See you tomorrow.

	Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He
	doesn't turn to look back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

	A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around
	a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk
	and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out
	by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars
	as they crawl by.

	Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

	Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare
	through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield
	wipers.

			     LYNN
		I hope nobody got hurt.

	Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently.

			     LYNN
		You're very quiet.
			(beat)
		You're mad I missed the play,
		aren't you?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     LYNN
		I have two jobs, baby.  You know
		how important they are for us.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		I'd give anything to have been
		there.

			     COLE
		I'm ready to communicate with you
		now.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Communicate?

			     COLE
		Tell you my secrets.

	The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

	Cole takes a long time.

			     COLE
		You know that accident up there?

			     LYNN
			(confused)
		Yeah.

			     COLE
		Someone got hurt.

			     LYNN
		They did?

			     COLE
		A lady.  She died.

			     LYNN
		Oh my God.

	Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield
	with her palm to see better.

			     LYNN
		You can see her?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.
	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Where is she?

			     COLE
		Standing next to my window.

	A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES, HELMET CRACKED, HAIR MATTED WITH
	RAIN AND BLOOD, STANDS STARING THROUGH COLE'S PASSENGER WINDOW.

	Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his
	window.  She eyes Cole.

			     LYNN
		Cole, you're scaring me.

			     COLE
		They scare me too sometimes.

			     LYNN
		They?

			     COLE
		Dead people.

			     LYNN
		Dead people?

			     COLE
		Ghosts.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		You see ghosts, Cole?

			     COLE
		They want me to do things for them.

			     LYNN
		They talk to you?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     LYNN
		They tell you to do things?

	Cole nods "Yes" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave
	understanding.  Cole watches her.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		...I don't know.

			     COLE
		You think I'm a freak?

	Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole gazes at her intense expression.

			     LYNN
		I would never think that about you
		...  ever... Got it?

			     COLE
		Got it.

	BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down.

			     LYNN
		Just let me think for a second.

	She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Grandma says hi.

	Lynn looks up sharply.

			     COLE
		She says she's sorry for taking the
		bumble bee pendant.  She just likes
		it a lot.

			     LYNN
		What?

			     COLE
		Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

	Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,
	her words are extremely controlled.

			     LYNN
		Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's
		gone.  You know that.

			     COLE
		I know.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you--

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		Cole, please stop.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you, she saw
		you dance.

	Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.

			     COLE
		She said when you were little, you
		and her had a fight right before
		your dance recital.  You thought
		she didn't come to see you dance.
		She did.

	Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.

			     COLE
		She hid in the back so you wouldn't
		see...  She said you were like an
		angel.

	Lynn begins to cry.

			     COLE
		She said, you came to her where
		they buried her.  Asked her a
		question...  She said the answer is
		"Everyday."

	Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through
	her fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What did you ask?

	Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Do I make her proud?

	Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother
	and son hold each other tight.

	WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER
	WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND
	HIS MOTHER.

	WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE
	SIDEWALK.  WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

	Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,
	she looks like a little girl.

	Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

	Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE
	CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.

	Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.
	He gazes upon his wife softly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Anna, I've been so lost.
			(beat)
		I need my best friend.

	Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

			     ANNA
		I miss you.

	Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.
	ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.

	Malcolm can't believe it.

			     MALCOLM
		I miss you.

	Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

			     ANNA
		Why, Malcolm?

			     MALCOLM
		What, Anna?  What did I do?  What's
		made you so sad?

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		Why did you leave me?

			     MALCOLM
		I didn't leave you.

	Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her
	arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE
	GROUND.

	Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes
	curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

	Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An
	identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

	Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS
	GONE.

	Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks
	around in confusion...

	His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He
	looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

	Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are
	drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on
	the tabletop.

	His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO
	PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His
	eyes fill with a storm of emotions...

	Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

	CLOSE ON ANNA...  TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME...  IT'S
	NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING
	TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

			     MALCOLM
			(like he's falling
			 down a deep hole)
		No...

							SLAM CUT:

	FLASHBACK:  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.

	Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the
	floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

	Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his
	shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF
	BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his
	side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower
	back pours out blood uncontrollably.

	Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

	ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.

	Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then
	becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands
	desperately.

							SLAM CUT:

	PRESENT:  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

			     MALCOLM
			(screaming)
		     ANNA!

	MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.

	Anna just sleeps.

	Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.

	He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and
	suddenly becomes very still.

	Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her
	shut eyes.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't cry.

	Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.

			     MALCOLM
		I think I have to go.

	Malcolm's mind is racing.

			     MALCOLM
			(realizing)
		I just needed to do a couple of
		things.
			(beat)
		And I needed to tell you something.

			     ANNA
		Tell me.

	Beat.
			     MALCOLM
		You were never second...  Ever.

	Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		You sleep now, Anna.  Everything
		will be different in the morning.

	Anna lays still.

			     ANNA
		Goodnight, Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

	The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his
	wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.

	Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They
	close shut.

	WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA...  WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY
	CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...

	WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE...  THE ROOM
	BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.

	SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL.  SHE BREATHES GENTLY,
	FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.

	THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES...  MALCOLM IS AT THE
	MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS.  HE'S
	HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		...I think I've had too much to
		drink.

	Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they
	watch.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I just have to say, this day today
		has been one very special day...
		I wish we all could stay and play.

	The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What?

	Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.

	Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I never thought I'd feel the
		things I'm feeling.  I never
		thought I'd be able to stand up in
		front of my friends and family and
		tell them what's inside me...
		Today I can...

	Malcolm's eyes fill with water.

			     MALCOLM
			(softly)
		Anna Crowe...  I am in love.  In
		love I am.

	INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

	A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of
	a basement.

	LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

	Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands
	in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
	her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
	come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

	She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.
	She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she
	slides it out.

	Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.
	It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her
	breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly
	uncomfortable.

	Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster
	than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst
	of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

	WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.

	THE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

	Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
	Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty
	bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

	Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
	She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
		It's getting cold.

	MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
	tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
	brirfcase next to him.

	Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
	intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His
	charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

			     MALCOLM
		That's one fine frame.  A fine
		frame it is.

	Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
	dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
	The frame is a polished mahogany.

	He slips on the sweatshirt.

			     MALCOLM
		How much does a fine frame like
		that cost, you think?

	Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
			(smiling)
		I've never told you...  but you
		sound a little like Dr. Seuss when
		you're drunk.

	Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,
		Anna.

	Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get
	it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention
	slowly moves to the framed certificate.

			     ANNA
		Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at
		least a couple hundred.  Maybe
		three.

			     MALCOLM
		Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a
		C.D. rack for the bedroom.

			     ANNA
		Do you know how important this is?
		This is big time.
			(beat)
		I'm going to read it for you,
		doctor.

			     MALCOLM
		Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

	Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward
	her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
	tickle her.

			     ANNA
		In recognition for his outstanding
		achievement in the field of child
		psychology, his dedication to his
		work, and his continuing efforts to
		improve the quality of life for
		countless children and their
		families, the City of Philadelphia
		proudly bestows upon its son Dr.
		Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...
		the Mayor's Citation for
		Professional Excellence.

	Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

			     ANNA
		Wow.  They called you their son.

			     MALCOLM
		We can keep it in the bathroom.

	Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		It's not real, Anna.  Some
		secretary wrote that up.  Don't
		tell me you thought it was real?

	Anna's expression becomes serious.


			     MALCOLM
		What?

	She just keeps staring.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't do the quiet thing.  You know
		I hate it.

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		This is an important night for us.
		Finally someone is recognizing the
		sacrifices you made.  That you have
		put everything second, including me,
		for those families they're talking
		about.

	Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and
	holds them steady.

			     ANNA
		They're also saying that my husband
		has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift
		that allows him to hit a ball over a
		fence.  Or a gift that lets him
		produce beautiful images on a
		canvas...  Your gift teaches
		children how to be strong in
		situations where most adults would
		piss on themselves.
			(beat)
		Yes, I believe what they wrote
		about you.

	Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm
	smiles softly.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.

	Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What are we hugging about again?

	Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

			     ANNA
		Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to
		be any crying at this celebration.
		Just a lot of drinking and sex.

	Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

			     MALCOLM
		I would like some red wine in a
		glass.

	Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

			     MALCOLM
		I would not like it in a mug.  I
		would not like it in a jug.

	Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up
	laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to
	turn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

			     MALCOLM
		Bulb's out.

	Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
	bedroom.

	MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

	A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
	room.

	Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a
	pretend striptease song.

	Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling
	off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her
	playful dance.  She's facing away from him.

	He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's
	face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
	WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A
	lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

	Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
	awareness.

			     ANNA
		He's still in the house.

	A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.

	ANNA SCREAMS.

	Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

	Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know
	someone is inside.  Beat.

	Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that
	comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the
	figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested
	in the back of the bathroom.

	NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.

	The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes
	bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands
	are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a
	patch of white in his hair.

	Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off
	the stranger.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

	Anna barely nods her understanding.

			     MALCOLM
			(to the stranger)
		This is forty-seven Locust Street.
		You have broken a window and
		entered a private residence.  Do
		you understand what I'm saying?

	The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock
	on Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		You don't know so many things.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		There are no needles or
		prescription drugs of any kind in
		this house.

	The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm
	stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

	Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of
	color.

	The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

			     STRANGER
		Are you drunk?

	The stranger's stare slides to Anna.

			     STRANGER
		Did you get him drunk?

	The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A
	penetrating, unwavering stare.


			     STRANGER
		Do you know why you're scared when
		you're alone?

	Anna's expression instanly changes.

			     STRANGER
		I know.

	BEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.

			     MALCOLM
		What do you want?  I don't
		understand what you want.

	The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		What you promised.

	Malcolm stops all movement.

			     ANNA
		--My God.

			     MALCOLM
		--Do I know you?

			     STRANGER
		Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe. Recipient of awards from the
		Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe, he's helped so many children...
		And he doesn't even remember my
		name?

	Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to
	tremble.

			     STRANGER
		I was ten when you worked with me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

			     STRANGER
		Downtown clinic?  Single parent
		family?
			(beat)
		I had a possible mood disorder...
			(beat)
		I had no friends... you said I was
		socially isolated.
			(beat)
		I was afraid -- you called it acute
		anxiety...
			(beat)
		You were wrong.
			(beat)
		Come on, clear your head...  Male,
		nine...  Single parent...  Mood
		discorder... Acute anxiety.

	Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

			     STRANGER
		I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my
		system twenty-four hours a day...
		I still have no friends.  I still
		have no peace.  I'm still afraid.

	Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.

			     STRANGER
		...I'm still afraid.

	Malcolm stands.

			     MALCOLM
		Please give me a second to think.

	Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
	stranger.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Bed Freidken?

			     STRANGER
		Some people call me freak.

			     MALCOLM
		...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

	Tears fall down the stranger's face.

			     STRANGER
		I am a freak.

	Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks
	in his head.

			     MALCOLM
		--Vincent?

	THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.

			     MALCOLM
		Vincent Gray?

	VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

	Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
	waters.

			     MALCOLM
		I do remember you, Vincent.  You
		were a good kid.  Very smart...
		Quiet...  Compassionate...
		Unusually compassionate...

	Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

			     VINCENT
		You forgot cursed.

	VINCENT is fully crying now.

			     VINCENT
		You failed me.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help
		you...  I can try to help you now.

	Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and
	raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
	ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
	onto the bed.

	Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER
	HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the
	bathroom floor.

	ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON

	The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

	A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten
	notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,
	"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

	The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

	He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled
	throughout the file.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page
	reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

	As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
	and phrases circled throughout this new case history.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
	Crowe.

	Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
	across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

	A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

	COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy
	with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
	him.

	His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
	Cole carefully locks the door behind him.

	He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
	Anxiously.

	The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
	pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

	Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down
	and buttons his jacket.

	When he looks up, Cole is gone.

	Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full
	speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS
	SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.

	For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He
	stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a
	street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a
	parking lot.

	COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
	building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
	ornate doors.  He slips inside.

	Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and
	then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone
	and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
	around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
	quietly.

	A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it
	quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
	doors.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - DAY

	Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

	Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
	in the last row of the church.

	He moves down the center aisle towards the back.

	Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
	beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
	other.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Pro... Fun... Add...

	The words are unintelligible.

	Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
	him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body
	still with fear.

			     MALCOLM
		It's okay, Cole.  Don't be
		frightened.

	Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

			     MALCOLM
		My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I
		was supposed to meet you today.
		Sorry I missed our appointment.

	Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you mind if I sit down?  I have
		this injury from a couple of years
		ago and it flares up every once in
		a while just so I won't forget it.

	Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
	the seat.  Malcolm sits.

	Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and
	stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		Your eye frames.  They don't seem to
		have any lenses in them.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt
		my eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I knew there was a sound explanation.

	Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What was that you were saying
		before with your soldiers?  Day pro
		fun.

			     COLE
		...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

	Malcolm stares surprised.

			     COLE
		It's called Latin.  It's a
		language.

	Malcolm nods at the information.

			     MALCOLM
		All your soldiers speak Latin?

			     COLE
		No, just one.

	Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
	Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.

	Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost
	healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I like churches, too.
			(beat)
		In olden times, in Europe, people
		used to hide in churches.  Claim
		sanctuary.

	Cole looks up.

			     COLE
		What were they hiding from?

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad
		people for one.  People who wanted
		to imprison them.  Hurt them.

			     COLE
		Nothing bad can happen in a church,
		right?

	Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

			     MALCOLM
		Right.

	Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

			     COLE
		I forgot your name.

			     MALCOLM
		Dr. Crowe.

			     COLE
		You're a doctor.  What kind?

			     MALCOLM
		I work with young people who might
		be sad or upset or just want to
		talk.  I try to help them figure
		things out.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Are you a good doctor?

	Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		I got an award once.  From the
		Mayor.

			     COLE
		Congratulations.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.  It was a long time ago.
		I've kind of been retired for a
		while.
			(beat)
		You're my very first client back.

			     COLE
		You use needles?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		Not even little ones that aren't
		supposed to hurt?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		That's good.

	Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

			     COLE
		I'm going to see you again, right?

			     MALCOLM
		If it's okay with you?

	Cole thinks it over carefully.

			     COLE
		It's okay with me.

	Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

			     MALCOLM
		And Cole, next time I won't be late
		for you.

			     COLE
		Next time I won't be scared of you.

	Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses
	himself in his thoughts.

	When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
	take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the
	statue and quietly leaves the church.

	Malcolm just sits and stares.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING

	The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

			     MALCOLM
		It's me.

	He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He
	stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or
	"Final Notice" stamped on it.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

	Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place
	setting on the table.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS
	ON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.

	Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

	He stares at his wife...

	She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He
	takes it in silently.

	His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her
	soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly
	looks like an angel.

	Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

	THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm
	reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file
	cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits
	in the corner next to the wine racks.

	The room still feels unsettling.

	Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of
	dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

	The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

	Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten
	on the first page are the words,

		"De profundis calms ad te, domine"

	Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to
	each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

	Malcolm translates the last word.

	He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

		"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...The mass for the dead.

	The words seem to hang in the air forever.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

	Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back
	in time.

	A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical
	old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of
	the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence
	Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot
	statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the
	morning sky...

	AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

	FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and
	hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon
	restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make
	their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

	A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

	A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out
	of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.

	LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.

	She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly
	for work.

	Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South
	Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of
	Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and
	sweet-looking young woman.

	Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.

	A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.

	Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are
	open.

	Lynn shakes her head.

			     LYNN
		Cole.

	She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

	Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises
	the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine.

	TINY FOOTSTEPS.

	Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.

			     LYNN
		Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

	Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie.

			     LYNN
		You got a spot.

	Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as
	Lynn walks back into the laundry room.

	The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
	new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the
	kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

	Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.

	Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on
	the tabletop.

	He looks shaken.

	Neither says anything for a beat.

			     LYNN
			(shaken)
		Something you were looking for,
		baby?

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		Pop Tarts.

	Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts
	are clearly visible.

			     LYNN
		They're right here.

			     COLE
		Oh.

	Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make
	eye contact.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		Lots of things.

			     COLE
		Anything bad about me?

	Lynn leans down.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole does.

			     LYNN
		I wasn't thinking anything bad
		about you, got it?

	He looks at her eyes.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Got it.

	THE DOOR BELL RINGS.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		That's Tommy, Momma.

	Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.

			     LYNN
		Don't you want this?

	Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and
	takes them from her before leaving.

	Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the
	TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

	Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps
	her arms around her shivering shoulders.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - MORNING

	TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid
	who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school
	uniform.

	Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.
	Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.

	The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy
	puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.

	When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,
	Tommy rips his arm away.

			     TOMMY
		Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm
		around your shoulder" bit.  I just
		made it up.  Went with it.  That's
		what great actors do.  It's called
		improv.

	Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals.

			     TOMMY
			(taunting)
		Be careful...  I hope no one jumps
		out and gets you.

	Tommy runs away.

	Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. ANTHONY'S ACADEMY - MORNING

	The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of
	St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.

	Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.
	He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.

	Beat.

	He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by
	himself into the school.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

	The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He
	looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn
	seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with
	her.  They both look up.

	Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		How was school, baby?

	Cole shrugs.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		You know, you can tell me things if
		you need to.

	Cole doesn't respond.  Beat.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		Well, you know what I did today?

	Cole shakes his head "No."

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in
		the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate
		a big picnic in the park with lots
		of chocolate mouses pie and then
		swam in the fountain all afternoon...
			(smiling)
		What did you do?

	Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was picked first for kickball
		teams at recess.  I hit a grand
		slam to win the game and everyone
		lifted me up on their shoulders and
		carried me around cheering.

	Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.

	Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile.

			     LYNN
		I'll make triangle pancakes.  You
		got an hour.

	Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the
	kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the
	corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

	Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.

	He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to sit?

	Cole nods very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Don't feel like talking right now?

	Cole nods again very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		How about we play a game first?

	Cole looks a little more interested.

			     MALCOLM
		It's a mind-reading game...  Did I
		mention I could read minds?

	Cole nods, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Here's the game.  I'll read your
		mind.  If what I say is right, you
		take a step forwards the chair.  If
		I'm wrong, you take a step
		backwards the doorway.  If you
		reach the chair, you sit.  If you
		reach the door, you can go.  Deal?

	Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville
	magician.  He closes his eyes tight.

			     MALCOLM
		Just after your mom and dad were
		divorced, your mom went to a doctor
		like me and it didn't help her.
		And so you think I'm not going to
		help you.

	Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.

			     MALCOLM
		You're worried because she said she
		told him things.  Things she
		couldn't tell anybody else.
			(beat)
		Secrets.

	Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		You have a secret.  But you don't
		want to tell me.

	Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at
	the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		You don't have to tell me your
		secret if you don't want to.

	Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading
	position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE
	SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably
	slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father gave you that watch as
		a present before he left.

	Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands
	surprised.

			     COLE
		He forgot it in a drawer.  It
		doesn't work.

	Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a
	little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't like to say much at
		school.  You're an excellent
		student however.  You've never been
		in any kind of serious trouble.

	Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		We were supposed to draw a picture.
		Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.
		He got hurt in the neck by another
		man with a screwdriver.

	AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE OVERTAKES THE DEN.

			     MALCOLM
		You saw that on T.V., Cole?

	Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Everybody got upset.  They had a
		meeting.  Momma started crying.
			(beat)
		I don't draw like that anymore.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you draw now?

			     COLE
		I draw people with smiles, dogs
		running, and rainbows.
			(beat)
		They don't have meetings about
		rainbows.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		I guess they don't.

	Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the
	doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He
	doesn't move at all.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What am I thinking now?

	Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No
	fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You're thinking...
			(beat)
		I don't know what you're thinking,
		Cole.

	Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was thinking...  you're nice.
			(beat)
		But you can't help me.

	Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the
	empty doorway where his client used to stand.

	THE DEN IS SUFFOCATED WITH SILENCE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian
	restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many
	candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.

	Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten
	dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE
	OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

	Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across
	from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I thought you meant the other
		Italian restaurant I asked you to
		marry me in.

	Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm so sorry.
			(beat)
		I can't seem to keep track of time.

	Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.

			     MALCOLM
		It didn't go well today.  Spent
		some time after trying to get my
		head together.

	Anna looks around for the waiter.

			     MALCOLM
		They're so similar, Anna.  They
		have the same mannerisms.  The same
		expressions.  The same thing
		hanging over them.
			(beat)
		It might be some kind of abuse.

	That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then
	looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		There are cuts on Cole's arms.
		Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks
		like defensive cuts.

	Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.

			     MALCOLM
			(beat)
		Possibly a teacher, neighbor.
			(beat)
		I don't think it's the mother.
		Just a gut thing.  The way she
		deals with him.  It doesn't fit.
			(beat)
		Hard to say this early.  Could
		just be a child climbing a lot of
		trees.

	Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the
	check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly
	signs it.

			     MALCOLM
		I know I've been kind of out of it
		for a long while and you resent it.
		You do.  I know you're mad.  I know
		it's put some distance between us.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		But I'm getting a second chance
		here.  I can't let it slip away.

	Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes
	her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits
	alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		...Happy Anniversary.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the
	steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of
	a war.

	Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.
	Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.

	Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression.

			     COLE
		You want to ask me a question?

			     MALCOLM
		See, this is why I lose at poker.
		Yes, I do have a question.

	On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one
	side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points
	to them.

			     MALCOLM
		What happened to those two?  Being
		under tissue paper can't be a good
		thing.

	Cole removes the tissue.

			     COLE
		That's Private Jenkins and Private
		Kinney.  They got killed.  Private
		Jenkins has a baby girl that was
		born seven pounds, six ounces.
		He's never seen her.  He wanted to
		get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
		and hold her...

	Cole points to the other soldier.

			     COLE
		Private Kinney's wife is really
		sick -- she has something called a
		brain anism.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		You mean aneurysm.

			     COLE
		Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get
		back safe to take care of her.

	Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes.

			     COLE
		It's sad they died, isn't it?

	Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole
	wipes his eyes quickly.

			     COLE
		Don't look at me.
			(beat)
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

	Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression.

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Malcolm looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		Where should I look then, Cole?

			     COLE
		Look over there.

	Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.
	He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It's very unusual for someone your
		age to understand the kind of
		problems that Private Jenkins and
		Private Kinney have or even to be
		thinking about them at all...

	Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It is okay if I look back now?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     MALCOLM
		Tap the foot once for "No" and
		twice for "Yes."

	Cole taps his foot once.

	Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a
	while.

			     MALCOLM
		You wouldn't want to take a walk,
		would you?

	Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side
	of the street.

	Cole taps his foot twice.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park
	where children Cole's age are playing.

			     COLE
		I walk this way to school with
		Tommy Tammisimo.

			     MALCOLM
		He your best buddy?

	Cole almost smiles.

			     COLE
		He hates me.

			     MALCOLM
		You hate him?

	Cole shakes his head, "No.!

	Malcolm thinks for a bit.

			     MALCOLM
		Your mom set that up?

	Cole nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		You ever tell her about how it is
		with Tommy?

			     COLE
		I don't tell her a thing.

			     MALCOLM
		Why?

			     COLE
		Cause she doesn't look at me like
		everybody and I don't want her to.
		I don't want her to know.

			     MALCOLM
		Know what?

			     COLE
		That I'm a freak.

	Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		Listen to me.  You are not a freak.
		Don't you believe anybody that
		tells you that.  It's bullshit and
		you don't have to grow up believing
		that.

	Beat.  Cole is surprised.

			     COLE
		You said the "s" word.

			     MALCOLM
		Yeah.  Sorry.

	Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by
	Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at
	Malcolm with different eyes.

	They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move
	down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing
	at the gate of a brownstone.

			     COLE
		Is it okay if I do something?  I
		have to do something.

	Malcolm nods "yes" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they
	approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can
	barely see.

			     COLE
		Hi, Mr. Marschal.

	MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few
	seconds.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Guten Tag, Cole.

	Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down
	the block with a concerned expression.

			     COLE
		What's wrong?

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Mrs. Marschal.  She went food
		shopping.  She's running late.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Ich Habe Durst.

	Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to
		speak German?

			     COLE
		I just know a couple lines.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Yes, you may have a drink.  What
		would you like?

			     COLE
		Lemonade, please.

	Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.
	Cole turns back to Malcolm.

			     COLE
			(sad)
		Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

			     MALCOLM
		What about Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		She died a long time ago.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many
	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared
	by two people.

	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
	open door.

	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
	Cole with a crinkled brow.

	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Maybe Jill will play for us when
		she gets back.

	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of
	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

			     COLE
		Thank you.

	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally
	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...
	THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.
	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE
	POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole--

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		What's going on there?

	Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.

	Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to
	push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches
	over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

	Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They
	reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

	Malcolm becomes very still.

	Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.
	Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Is this for me?

	Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick
	glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his
	nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.

			MR. MASCHAL
		What's this?  Jill's keeping a
		diary.

	Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

	Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		She's full of surprises...

	He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at
	the final page of writing.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
			(whispers)
		She hasn't written anything for
		some time.

	Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up
	to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.

	Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They
	gently spill down his weathered face.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Oh no...

	Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The
	sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.

	Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.
	Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

	They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and
	brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

	Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares
	down at Cole in a daze.

	Cole turns his head, crying.

			     COLE
			(softly)
		Stop looking at me.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a
	point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his
	mouth.

	CLICK.

			     MALCOLM
		April or March of Eighty-seven.
		Two weeks into sessions with
		Vincent Gray.  I was treating a
		couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,
		who had lost their child to
		Leukemia.  They were waiting with
		Vincent in the reception room of
		the downtown clinic.  They were
		alone together maybe fifteen
		minutes.  When I entered the room,
		all three were crying.  The
		Wagner's progress from that
		afternoon was dramatic and sudden
		....  As if some door had been
		opened for them.
			(beat)
		I'm not at all clear what happened
		in those fifteen minutes.  But I
		now believe Vincent tried to tell
		me something, show me something and
		I didn't listen.
			(beat)
		Cole Sear allowed me to witness
		something today.
			(beat)
		This time I'm going to listen.

	A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the
	thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter
	jacket in the house.

	Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The
	house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

	Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw
	something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN
	THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.

	She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts
	laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she
	HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF
	PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

	Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

	Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...
	Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a
	pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

	Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she
	notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo
	of three-year-old Cole.

	WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S
	FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE
	BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE
	SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.

	Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --
	Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the
	picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE
	LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.

	WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --
	SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN
	FINDS A BLUR.

	Lynn takes it all in curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on
	her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED
	TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's
	room.

	This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes
	and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The
	lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

	The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade
	tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and
	bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

	A sign hangs over the bedsheets.

		"DO NOT ENTER"

	Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

	A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts
	his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his
	slumber.

	Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under
	Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a
	couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a
	larger version of Cole.

	The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky
	breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

	Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll
	cover desk next to the bed.

	The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.
	Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

	Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit
	involuntarily.

	THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless
	lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...
	The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at
	great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --
	everything written in one continuous motion.

	Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

	...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is
	going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop
	the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

	The words go on and on.

	Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones
	off slowly.

	THE MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT FILLS THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE EERIE
	ROOM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den.

			     MALCOLM
		...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh
		with a lady who works in a toll
		booth.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		What if she has to pee when she's
		working?  You think she just holds
		it?
			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.  I was just thinking
		the same thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		You ask a lot of questions about my
		dad today.  How come?

	Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his
	head.

			     MALCOLM
		Sometimes, we don't even know it,
		but we do things to draw attention.
		Do things so we can express how we
		feel about issues...  Divorce or
		whatever.

	Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with
	peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out
	what he's doing.

			     MALCOLM
		One night, as an example...  leave
		something on a desk for someone to
		find.

	The top of Cole's head stops moving.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, have you ever heard of
		something called free-writing?  Or
		free-association writing?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's when you put a pencil in your
		hand and put the pencil to a paper
		and you just start writing...  You
		don't think about what you're
		writing...  You don't read over
		what you're writing...  You just
		keep your hand moving.

	Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		After awhile if you keep your hand
		moving long enough, words and
		thoughts start coming out you
		didn't even know you had in you...
		Sometimes they're things you heard
		from somewhere...  Sometimes
		they're feelings deep inside...
			(beat)
		Have you ever done any free-
		association writing, Cole?

	Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What'd you write?

			     COLE
		Words.

			     MALCOLM
		What kind of words?

			     COLE
		Upset words.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Did you ever write any upset words
		before your father left?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't remember.

	Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question
	off casually.

			     MALCOLM
		Can you do something for me?

	Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat.

			     MALCOLM
		Think about what you want from our
		time together.  What our goal
		should be?

			     COLE
		Something I want?

			     MALCOLM
		If we could change something in
		your life, anything at all, what
		would you like that to be?

	Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't have to answer now.

	Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind
	the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the
	ground like a dress.

			     COLE
		Instead of something I want, can I
		have something I don't want?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods "Yes."  Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't want to be scared anymore.

	Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.
	Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.

	He circles a phrase...

	"...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in
	fact, be self-inflicted."

	Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his
	head.

	ANNA'S MUFFLED VOICE CARRIES DOWN THE STAIRS.

	His face turns up to the ceiling.

			     MALCOLM
			(loud)
		Are you calling me?

	WE HEAR ANNA'S FOOTSTEPS MOVE ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING.  WE
	HEAR THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		What?  You don't see enough of me
		at the store?

	Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches
	his legs.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		On my way to the flea market in
		Amish country.  Thought maybe you
		want to come.  Show me how to buy
		at these things.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		I trust you...  Besides, I don't
		know if I'm up for the Amish today.
		You can't curse or spit or anything
		around them.

	Malcolm smiles at Anna.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I thought you'd want to get out.
		You've been kind of down.

	Malcolm slowly stops smiling.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		That's very sweet.  I'm okay.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Do you think I should stop by on my
		way back?  Show you what I got?
		It's not a problem.

	Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		You know that's probably not the
		best idea.  I'll just wait to see
		them in the store.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Okay.  Fine.  Understood.
			(beat)
		I'm off then.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		Don't step in the horse manure.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Thanks.

	WE HEAR THE FRONT DOOR SHUT.

	Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window.

	INT./EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - DAY

	We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.

	He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a
	moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel.

			     MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Give it up, kid.

	Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and
	pulls away from Malcolm's house.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

	STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a
	question on the board.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Can anyone guess what city was the
		capital of the United States of
		America from 1790 to 1800?

	Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine
	year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

	Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big
	eyes.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		...I'll give you a hint, it's the
		city you live in.

	The class says the answer in unison.

			     CLASS
		Philadelphia.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Right...  Philadelphia is one of
		the oldest cities in the country.
		A lot of generations have lived and
		died in this city...  Almost every
		place you visit has a history and a
		story behind it.
			(beat)
		Even this school and the grounds
		they sit on...  Can anyone guess
		what this building was used for a
		hundred years ago, before you went
		here, before I went to this school
		even?

	Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's
	just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.
	Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Yes, Cole?

			     COLE
		They used to hang people here.

	Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		That's not correct.  Where'd you
		hear that?

			     COLE
		They'd pull the people in crying
		and kissing their families bye...
		People watching would spit at them.

	Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
		Laws were passed here.  Some of the
		first laws of this country.  This
		building was full of lawyers.
		Lawmakers.

			     COLE
		They were the ones who hanged
		everybody.

	Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know which one of these
		guys told you that, but they were
		just trying to scare you, I think.

	Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.

	Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the
	teacher who is still staring.

			     COLE
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Like what?

			     COLE
		Stop it!

	Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and
	instantly stops smiling.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know how else to look--

			     COLE
		You're a stuttering Stanley!

	Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Excuse me?

			     COLE
		You talked funny when you went to
		school here.  You talked funny all
		the way to high school!

	The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an
	involuntary step towards Cole's desk.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		What--

			     COLE
		You shouldn't laugh at people.  It
		makes them feel bad.

	Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		How did you--?

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Cole covers his eyes with his hands.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who have you been s-speaking to?

	We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who!

	Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssstop that!

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssssstop it!

			     COLE
		Stuttering--

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

	MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop
	from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.

	The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.

	Cole's eyes are filled with tears.

	Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins
	to cry.

	INT. ANTHONY'S LIBRARY - SAME AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a
	long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his
	folded arms on the table.

	Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right
	place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a
	seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes
	are hard -- filled with anger.

			     MALCOLM
		Hey, big guy.

	Cole stares for a second.

			     COLE
		I don't want to talk about anything.

	Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.

	THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN
	THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

	Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in
	the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you like magic?

	Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks
	to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his
	right hand.

			     MALCOLM
		Watch the penny closely.

	Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

			     MALCOLM
		I do the magic shake...

	Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		And suddenly the penny has
		magically traveled to my left hand...

	Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open
	it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's not the end of the trick.
		With another magic shake, the penny
		travels into my shirt pocket...

	Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but
	doesn't open it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's still not the end!...  I
		do a final magic shake...  and
		suddenly...  The penny returns to
		the hand where it started from.

	Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the
	center of his palm.

	Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.
	Cole cracks a smile.

			     COLE
		That isn't magic.

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		You just kept the penny in that
		hand the whole time...

			     MALCOLM
		Who me?

	Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the
	table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		I didn't know you were funny.

			     MALCOLM
		I forgot myself.

	Malcolm and Cole share a warm look.

	THE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME
	POURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.

	Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the
	windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...

	Cole looks at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		One day...
			(beat)
		You're going to sound just like
		them.

	Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Promise?

	Beat.

		Promise.

	Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF

		Malcolm, sit your cute butt down

		Are you listening?

	Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty
	living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the
	sofa.

	THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.
	IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.  A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS
	HOLDING THE MICROPHONE.   IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE
	FLOOR.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		No doubt about it.  Anna's like my
		sister.  You better make her happy...
		And I'm not talking about -- mmm
		this tastes like real butter --
		kind of happy...  I'm talking about
		Julie Andrews twirling around like
		a mental patient on a mountain top
		-- kind of happy.

	THE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		You're really lucky.  She's got so
		much love for you.  Don't tell her
		I told you, but she said she loved
		you from the first time she met you
		on the street.  She'd do anything
		for you.
			(crying)
		I love you guys.
			(more crying)
		My nose is running.  Why isn't
		someone getting me a tissue?

	THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN.  THE CAMERA
	PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR.  MALCOLM AND
	ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH
	OTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.
	He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm moves into their bedroom.

	THE SOUND OF A SHOWER CAN BE HEARD FROM THE BATHROOM.

	Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the
	silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.
	Anna stands still, her head tilted back.

	Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's
	taken by his wife's beauty.

	Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the
	sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble
	surface.

	He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle
	reads,

		"Zoloft Anti-depressant"
		"To be taken twice daily"

	Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the
	still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

	Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise
	with the door as he closes it shut.

	are sitting on the table next to a cake.

	The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND
	LAUGHING.

	Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.
	Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in
	circles in the air.

		...Then you do the magic shake.
		And now the penny moves from my
		pocket all the way to the hand it
		started in.

	Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal
	the penny.

	Bobby stares.

			     BOBBY
		That's stupid.

	Cole loses his smile.

			     COLE
		It's supposed to be funny.

			     BOBBY
		It's stupid.

	Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other.

			     BOBBY
		Give me my penny back.

	Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby.

			     COLE
			(almost inaudible)
		...Don't be sad.

	Bobby looks up sharply.

			     BOBBY
			(hard)
		What'd you say?

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		...Nothing.

	Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his
	tattered napkin.

	The two boys sit in silence.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open
	kitchen doorway is next to him.  Inside the kitchen are Lynn and
	DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.
	Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic
	heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit.

			     LYNN
		...He doesn't get invited places.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		It's our pleasure.

			     LYNN
		The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
		party a year ago.  He hid in one of
		those purple plastic tunnels and
		didn't come out.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		Chuck E. who?

			     LYNN
		Cheese.  It's a kid's place.

	Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering
	people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling
	silver trays.

			     LYNN
		He's my whole life.

	Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face.

			     LYNN
		I work at an insurance place and at
		Penny's, so Cole can go to that
		good school.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		J. C. Jenny's?

	Lynn nods "Yes."

			     DARREN'S MOM
			(bullshit)
		Good for you.

			     LYNN
		I wish I could be like my momma
		though.  She always knew what was
		wrong.  Knew just what to say.

	Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch.

			     LYNN
		Cole's going through something bad.
		He won't talk to me.
			(beat)
		I'm his momma.
			(emotional)
		And I don't know what's wrong and
		I don't know what to say.

	Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen
	with sad eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors
	d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway.

			     MRS. WESTON
		Did you have the Brie?

			     MRS. SAUNDERS
		It tasted like cheese whiz.

	They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.
	The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.

	Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as
	he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's
	eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.

	THE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE
	BACKYARD.

	Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the
	birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat.

			     TOMMY
		I even got a trailer.

			     DARREN
		For what?  You only had one line.

			     TOMMY
		You're slow, you know that.  The
		star of the commercial always has
		his own trailer.  You need to think
		about your character alone.

	Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring
	at the crawl space closet.

	Tommy grabs Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Darren, check it out.

	     DARREN looks down the hall to Cole.

			     DARREN
		My dad made me invite him.

	Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his
	trance as Tommy and Darren walk up.

			     COLE
		Happy birthday, Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Something you want to see in there?

	Tommy points to the crawl space.

			     COLE
			(too quick)
		--No.

	Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole.

			     TOMMY
		We're going to put on a pretend
		play.  You want to be in it?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		...Okay.

			     TOMMY
		It's called, "Locked in the Dungeon."

	Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it.

			     DARREN
		Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the
		one locked in the dungeon.

	It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove
	Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space.

			     COLE
		Don't!

	Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack
	smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

	The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

	SILENCE.

	Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl
	space door.

	Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

	Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN
	TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against
	the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES
	like it's going to break off its hinges.

	The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE
	HALLWAY.

	FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down
	the hall.  Lynn is one of them.

	Darren's mother turns the corner.

			     DARREN'S MOTHER
		Who's making that noise?

	She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH
	THE HALL.

			     LYNN
		Cole!

	Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The
	door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's
	UNCONSCIOUS.

	Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside
	except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.
	She turns around with Cole in her arms.

			     LYNN
			(desperate whispers)
		Help me get him in the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

	Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception
	area.

	A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.

	Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game
	made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.

	A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.
	He opens up his notes.

			     LYNN
		What's wrong with Cole?

	Beat.

			     DR. HILL
		The tests indicate he did not have
		a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.
		After some rest, he could go home
		tonight.

	Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm
	eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman
	standing at the reception room door.

			     MALCOLM
		There's something else going on,
		Lynn.

	Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

			     DR. HILL
		There are some scratches and
		bruises on your son that concern me.

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, man.

			     LYNN
		Those are from sports, from playing.
		He's not the most coordinated kid,
		but I don't want him to stop trying,
		you know what I mean?

	Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway.

			     DR. HILL
		Mrs. Sloan over there is our social
		worker at the hospital.  She's
		going to ask you some procedural
		questions.

			     LYNN
		You think I hurt my child?
			(emotional)
		You think I'm a bad mother?

			     DR. HILL
		At this point it's just procedure.
		And you should probably calm down.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you expect her to react?

			     LYNN
		You want me to answer your
		questions?

			     DR. HILL
			(sarcastic)
		I'm sorry if I was being vague --
		yes, I do.

			     LYNN
		Who's going to answer mine, you
		dick.

	Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files.

			     LYNN
			(raising voice)
		What happened to my child today?

	Dr. Hill gets up.

			     LYNN
		Something was happening to him --
		physically happening.  Something
		was very wrong.

	Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception
	room without looking back.

	Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks
	up to the table and waits.

	Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable
	strength.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		How long will these questions take?

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him
	as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

	Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.
	Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes.

			     MALCOLM
		I've decided we shouldn't schedule
		sessions anymore.  I'll just follow
		you around.

	Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal
	chair.

	Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital
	gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride
	up all the way to his knees.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father ever tell you bedtime
		stories?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in
	the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Once upon a time there was a prince,
		who was being driven around...  He
		drove around for a long, long time...
		Driving and driving...  It was a
		long trip...  He fell asleep...
			(beat)
		When he woke up, they were still
		driving...  The long drive went on--

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You haven't told bedtime stories
		before?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		You have to add some twists and
		stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas.

			     MALCOLM
		No gas...  Hey, that's good.

	They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head.

			     COLE
		Tell me a story about why you're
		sad.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you think I'm sad?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What makes you think that?

			     COLE
		Your eyes told me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client.

			     MALCOLM
			(rote)
		I'm not supposed to talk about
		stuff like that.

	Cole smiles softly.

	Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the
	hospital bed.

	Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.

	Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed.

			     MALCOLM
		...Once upon a time there was this
		person named Malcolm.  He worked
		with children.  Loved it more than
		anything.
			(smiles)
		Then one night, he finds out he
		made a mistake with one of them.
		Didn't help that one at all.  He
		thinks about that one a lot.  Can't
		forget.
			(beat)
		Ever since then, things have been
		different.  He's become messed up.
		Confused.  Angry.  Not the same
		person he used to be.
			(beat)
		His wife doesn't like the person
		he's become.  They don't speak
		anymore.  They're like strangers.

	Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches
	him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		And then one day this person
		Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who
		reminds him of that one.  Reminds
		him a lot of that one.  Malcolm
		decides to try to help this new boy.
		He thinks maybe if he can help this
		boy, it would be like helping that
		one too.

	Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how the story ends.
		I hope it's a happy ending.

			     COLE
		Me too.

	Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a
	long time.

	EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID FROM THIS POINT ON IS WHISPERED.

			     COLE
		I want to tell you my secret now.

	Malcolm blinks very slowly.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay.

	Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both.

			     COLE
		...I see people.

	Malcolm just gazes quietly.

			     COLE
		I see dead people...  Some of them
		scare me.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		In your dreams?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		When you're awake?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		Dead people, like in graves and
		coffins?

			     COLE
		No, walking around, like regular
		people...  They can't see each
		other.  Some of them don't know
		they're dead.

			     MALCOLM
		They don't know they're dead?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I see ghosts.

	Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.
	He and Cole stare at each other a long time.

			     COLE
		They tell me stories...  Things
		that happened to them...  Things
		that happened to people they know.

	Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing.

			     MALCOLM
		How often do you see them?

			     COLE
		All the time.  They're everywhere.
			(beat)
		You won't tell anyone my secret,
		right?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		...No.

			     COLE
		Will you stay here till I fall
		asleep?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and
	turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and
	stares at Cole.

	MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find
	nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

	COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY...  WE MOVE IN ON THEM --
	TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.

	Beat.

	And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital
	room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.
	Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are
	patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN
	HOSPITAL GOWNS...  SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

	THEY STAND UNNATURALLY STILL IN THEIR WINDOWS...  WATCHING,
	WAITING.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

	Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his
	thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR
	SUDDENLY EMERGES FROM THE STEAM, NARROWLY MISSING MALCOLM.

	Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.
	His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches
	down and picks it up.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...
			(beat)
		His pathology is more severe than
		initially assessed.
			(beat)
		He's suffering from visual
		hallucinations, paranoia --
		Symptoms of some kind of school age
		Schizophrenia.
			(beat)
		Medication and hospitalization may
		be required.

	CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm not helping him.

	Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash
	like thunder in his head.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in
	silence.  She glances down to her right.

	Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his
	regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks
	like a four-year-old.

	The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.

	Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's
	head as she drives.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her
	shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.

	Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd
	Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

	Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is
	curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He
	looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's
	sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to
	fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the
	fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the
	middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn
	pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL
	LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

	Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as
	she moves into her room and closes the door.

	WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole's
		mother.  I wonder if we could
		talk about your son and his
		friends keeping their goddamn
		hands off my boy?

	The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too
	still.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT


	An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.

	The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees.

	A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.

	The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan
	the darkness.

	The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed
	together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves
	cautiously into the hall.

	Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens
	it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.

	He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and
	pees into the toilet.

	A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.

	Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He
	slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his
	pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.
	He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.
	HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

	Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a
	SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

	Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down
	the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway
	of the kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.
	Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Momma?
			(beat)
		Dream about daddy again?

	The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The
	woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her
	forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER.

			     WOMAN
		DINNER'S -- NOT -- READY!

	Cole's face turns the color of ash.

			     WOMAN
		What are you going to do?

	Cole backs up to the doorway.

			     WOMAN
		You can't hurt me anymore!


	The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...
	They've been savagely cut.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Cole turns and runs down the hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs across his room.

	He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with
	the "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs
	disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.

	The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any
	closer.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment
	reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.

	The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

	It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined
	with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of
	saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole
	stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary
	made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - AFTERNOON

	THE LIGHTS IN THE GYM GO DOWN.  THE SPOT LIGHT OPENS ON THE STAGE
	AS THE CURTAINS MOVE TO THE SIDES...

	A sign to the side of the stage reads, "The third and fourth
	grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book."

	The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a
	villager's outfit.

			     TOMMY
			(Decent British accent)
		There once was a boy, very
		different than other boys.  He
		lived in the jungle, and he could
		talk with the animals.

	BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children.

	THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS THE FULL CAST OF THE ACTORS COME OUT.
	Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.

	Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.

	MALCOLM APPLAUDS FROM THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

	The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted
	drawings and test papers.

	Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall.

			     COLE
		Did you think the play sucked big
		time?

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough
		syrup commercial.  He thought
		everybody was self-conscious and
		unrealistic.  He said the play
		sucked big time.

			     MALCOLM
		I know every child is special in
		their own way, but Tommy sounds
		like a punk.
			(Cole smiles)
		I thought the play was excellent.
		Better than Cats.

			     COLE
		Cats?

			     MALCOLM
		Never mind.

	Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his
	time.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, I was really interested in
		what you told me in the hospital,
		I'd like to hear more about it.

	Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --
	realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find
	Cole frozen about ten feet back.

	Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets
	closer.

			     MALCOLM
		What's wrong?

	Cole points to the doors.

			     MALCOLM
		Is something in there?

	Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

	It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood
	beamed ceiling.

	Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		What is it?

	Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Be real still.

	Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.
	Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Sometimes you feel it inside.
		Like you're falling down real fast,
		but you're really just standing
		still.

	Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes.

			     COLE
		You ever feel prickly things on the
		back of your neck?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes?

			     COLE
		And the tiny hairs on your arm.
		Are they all standing up?

	Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face.

			     MALCOLM
		-- Yes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		When they get mad, it gets cold.

			     MALCOLM
		Them?

	Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.

	Nothing is said for a few moments.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see anything.
			(beat)
		Are you sure they're there?
			(beat)
		Cole?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his
	eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately.

			     COLE
		Please make them leave.

	Malcolm stares helplessly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm working on it.

	Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs.

	COLE GLANCES BACK AS HE MOVES OUT OF THE STAIRWELL.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top
	of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES
	HANGING BY THEIR NECKS FROM A WOODEN BEAM.

	It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no
	shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN
	in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to
	the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to
	their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with
	their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in
	front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.
	Night time has fallen over the city.

	He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds
	his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his
	arm's surface.

	Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill
	the corners of the historic building...

	Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...Is anyone there?

	A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then
	becomes still.

	Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his
	pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to
	his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED
	VOICES SPILL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Look, he's an eight-year-old child.
		He's my only client.  If he invites
		me to his play, I'm not thinking
		about how late I get back...  I go.
		I have to go.  You know that.
		That's the only way I know how to
		work.
			(beat)
		Vincent said I failed him.
			(raising his voice)
		I WON'T GIVE COLE A CHANCE TO SAY
		THOSE WORDS TO ME!  I WON'T!

	Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Please let it ring.

	WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She
	wipes her tears.

	She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

	Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.

	ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

			     ANNA
		I can't talk now.

	Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on
	the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the
	basement door again.

			     ANNA
			(whispers)
		I thought about you too.

	Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.
	Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm.

			     LYNN
		I don't care what they say, this
		thing is definitely broken.

	Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up
	twelve inch kitchen T.V.

	ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his
	pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs.

			     TOMMY
			(on T.V.)
		Mommy, my throat hurts.

	Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a
	spoonful of medicine.

			     NARRATOR
			(on T.V.)
		Pediaease Cough Suppressant...
		gentle, fast, effective.

	Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the
	very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to
	the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole
	throws his shoe at the power button.

	He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.
	His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's
	extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill
	the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk
	glass with the gloves.

			     LYNN
		Take 'em off.

	Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his
	plate.

			     LYNN
		I don't want them on my table.

	Cole moves them to the floor.

	Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.

	Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		I saw what was in your bureau
		drawer when I was cleaning.

	Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		You got something you want to
		confess?

	Cole just stares.

			     LYNN
		The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you
		keep taking it?

	Cole looks down at his lap.

			     LYNN
		It was Grandma's.  It's not for
		playing.
			(beat)
		What if it broke?  You know how sad
		I'd be.

			     COLE
		You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma
		so much.

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		That's right.  So why do you take
		it, sweetheart?

			     COLE
		Sometimes people think they lose
		things and they didn't really lose
		them.  It just gets moved.

			     LYNN
		Did you move the bumble bee pendant?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."  Lynn just stares.

			     LYNN
		You didn't take it before.  You
		didn't take it the time after that.
		And now, you didn't take it again?

			     COLE
		Don't get mad.

			     LYNN
		So who moved it?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		There's only two of us.
			(beat)
		Maybe someone came in our house --
		took the bumble bee pendant out of
		my closet, and then laid it nicely
		in your drawer?
			(beat)
		Is that what happened?

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Maybe.

	Lynn just stares at Cole.

			     LYNN
		I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in
		my body.  I'm tired in my mind.
		I'm tired in my heart.  I need a
		little help here.
			(beat)
		I don't know if you noticed -- but
		our little family isn't doing so
		good.

	Lynn folds her napkin quietly.

			     LYNN
		I'm praying for us, but I must not
		be praying right.
			(beat)
		It looks like we're just going to
		have to answer each other's prayers.
		If we can't talk to each other --
		we're not going to make it.
			(beat)
		Now baby, tell me...  I won't be
		mad, honey...  Did you take the
		bumble bee pendant?

	Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up.

			     COLE
		No.

	Lynn goes cold.

			     LYNN
		You've had enough roast beef.  You
		need to leave the table.

	Cole just stares at his mother's expression.

			     LYNN
			(yells)
		Go!

	Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and
	leaves the room.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF
	HIS PUPPY GROWLING.

	Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.
	Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a
	couch.

	Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

	THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  IT'S
	ALMOST SHUT.  COLE WATCHES AS THE DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN VERY
	SLOWLY.  IT OPENS WIDE.  COLE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH.

	SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE
	SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.
	IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

	Cole stops breathing.

	THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

	IT'S A BOY.  A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

	THE BOY WHISPERS IN A LOW, HOARSE VOICE.

			     BOY
		Come on...  I'll show you where my
		dad keeps his gun...  Come on.

	THE BOY TURNS.  WE SEE THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IS MISSING AS HE
	DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

	Cole is too terrified to move.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy
	out of the broom closet.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		Momma.

	Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are
	red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her
	hand.

	Mother and son look at each other.  Beat.

			     COLE
		If you're not very mad...  Can I
		sleep in your room tonight?

	Lynn fights back some tears.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face, Cole.

	Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son.

			     LYNN
		I'm not very mad.

	Lynn hugs him.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Baby...  Why are you shaking?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's wrong?

	Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight.

			     LYNN
			(desperate)
		...Please tell me.

	Cole doesn't say a word.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Please.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with
	furniture and knickknacks.

	Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer
	into a glass cabinet.

	An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

			     ANNA
		It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.
		Entirely platinum with a mine cut
		diamond and an actual color Burmese
		Sapphire...  It's timeless.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You got anything a little plainer?

	The young woman looks at her beau.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Plainer?  You want a plain ring to
		go with your plain fiance.  Is that
		how it is?

			     YOUNG MAN
		No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.
		It's just...  you're so beautiful...
		you're like a Burmese Sapphire all
		by yourself.  You don't need all
		that.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
			(disbelief)
		Uh-huh.

	Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.

			     ANNA
		Why don't you two hold it?

	She places it in their hands.

			     ANNA
		Do you feel longing?

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Excuse me?

			     ANNA
		When I touch this piece I feel a
		longing.  I imagine the woman who
		owned this, loved a man deeply she
		couldn't be with.

	The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Did he have wavy hair and broad
		shoulders?

	The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.

			     ANNA
		I don't know...  But maybe...
			(beat)
		A lot of the pieces in this store
		give me feelings.  I think maybe
		when people own things and then
		they pass away -- a part of
		themselves gets printed on those
		things -- like fingerprints.

	Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.

	They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it
	reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.

	Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying
	an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much
	needed seat.

			     SEAN
		You don't need someone with a
		masters.  You need a wrestler guy
		whose neck is larger than his head.

			     ANNA
		I need a wrestler with a masters.

	Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.

			     SEAN
		What's this?

	Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a
	BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her.

			     SEAN
		From you?

	Anna nods, "yes."

			     SEAN
		Is it wrestling tights?

	Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off
	the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.

	Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE
	GREAT GATSBY."  Beat.

			     ANNA
		It's a first edition.

			     SEAN
		Wow, this is too much.  It's
		perfect, Anna.

	Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,
	still holding her.  They smile at each other.

	Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second
	too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold
	each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.


	CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna
	and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the
	young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front
	door cracked in a spider web pattern.

	They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.
	Look around.   No one in sight.

	Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her
	face.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand
	goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

	Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.

	Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.

	Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.

	Beat.

	Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

	She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts
	as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is
	smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the
	air like he's on a roller coaster.

	Beat.

	They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn
	leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

	Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A
	little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries
	into the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - DAY

	Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

	Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.

	Lynn looks over.

			     LYNN
		Let's rent a movie.

	Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.

			     LYNN
		Your pick.

	Cole stares at his mom quietly.

			     LYNN
		It can even have Jean Claude Van
		Damme in it if you want.

	Cole smiles at that.  He nods, "Yes" joyfully.

	His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the
	HEATER controls.

	Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

	Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page
	from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a
	woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks
	into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl
	in the air.

			     COLE
			(yells)
		Momma, look out!

	The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her
	stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.

	Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

	Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.

	THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR...  HER TERROR-
	STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE
	WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...

	COLE SCREAMS.  LYNN SCREAMS...  THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN
	THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

	The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve
	to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the
	entire intersection has come to a halt.

	Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.

	He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No
	broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through
	the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped
	and staring all around them.

	Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at
	him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.
	The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why
	he screamed.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-
	colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --
	arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --
	eyes peering out over his arms.

	They both look like shit.

			     COLE
		You don't wanna ask me questions
		today?

	Malcolm nods, "No."  Beat.

			     COLE
		Can I ask you then?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		What do you want more than anything?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.

			     COLE
		I told you what I want.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know, Cole.

			     COLE
		Why don't you think about it for a
		while?

	Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I know what I want.
			(beat)
		My goal is to speak to my wife.
		The way she and I used to speak.
		Like there was no one in the world
		but us.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		How are you going to do that?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I can't be your doctor anymore.
			(beat)
		I haven't given my family enough
		attention.  Bad things happen when
		you do that.  Do you understand?

	The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft.

			     COLE
		You want to go home?

	Malcolm stares across at Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		I have to.

			     COLE
		When?

			     MALCOLM
		Soon.  One week.

	Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm going to transfer you.  I know
		two psychologists that are
		exceptional--

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Don't fail me.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

			     MALCOLM
		--What?

			     COLE
		Don't give up.  You're the only one
		who can help me.  I know it.

	Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to know a secret?...  I
		was a paper champion.
			(beat)
		Do you know what that means?

	Cole shake his head, "No."  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks.

			     COLE
		Don't cry.

			     MALCOLM
		I means I wasn't what everyone
		thought I was...
			(beat)
		I was a fake.

			     COLE
		You weren't a paper champion.

			     MALCOLM
		Someone else can help you.  Someone
		else can make you happy.

	Cole is crying now.

	Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare
	at each other.  Beat.

	Cole whispers.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You believe me, right?

	A long pause.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,
		right?

	They both just stare.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how to answer that.

	Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.
	It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down.

			     COLE
		How can you help me if you don't
		believe me?

	Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.

	Cole pushes it across the table.

	Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Some magic's real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes
	gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.

	Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the
	shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.

	Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's
	eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the
	label...

	"SESSION TAPES -- VINCENT GRAY"

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.
	Malcolm hits play.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING IS HEARD.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Sorry about that.  Hope I didn't
		leave you alone too long...  Wow,
		it's cold in here.

	WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent...  Why are you crying?
			(beat)
		Vincent?

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOICE ANSWERS.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape crying)
		Yes?

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What happened?
			(beat)
		Did something upset you?

	Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		You won't believe.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I won't believe what?

	Beat.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		I don't want to talk anymore.  I
		want to go home, okay?  I want to
		go home.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Okay, Vincent, you can go home.

	CLICK.  THE TAPE GOES TO SILENCE.

	Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a
	while.

	Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--about that.  Hope I didn't leave
		you too long...  Wow, it's cold in
		here--

	Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a
	while.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--like needles either.  When I was
		a kid, I had this blood test down --
		threw up chill cheese fries all
		over this male nurse.

	WE HEAR VINCENT CHUCKLE SOFTLY.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING IS HEARD.

			     SECRETARY
			(on tape)
		Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line
		two.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent, I have to take this.  Give
		me a minute.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		Okay.

	FOOTSTEPS AS MALCOLM AND THE SECRETARY LEAVE THE ROOM.  THE DOOR
	CLOSES.  AND THE SILENCE.

	Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR
	SCREECH ACROSS THE FLOOR.  VINCENT'S BREATHING QUICKENS.

	A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

	Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins
	in the player.

	Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up.
	THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

	Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and
	listens...  Beat.

	DEEP IN THE STATIC...  ANOTHER SOUND EMERGES, WHISPERING.

	A MAN'S VOICE IS HEARD IN THE ROOM WITH VINCENT

			     MAN'S WHISPERING
			(on tape)
		Familia...  No dejen que esto me
		pase...  Mi familia...  Yo no
		quiero morir...  Familia...

	Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief.

			     MALCOLM
		...Jesus Christ.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay
	window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

	Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of
	older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating
	sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a
	story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when
	he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he
	saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than
	the next.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.
	His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

	Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his
	hand to his side as he winces a bit.

	Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on
	the bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

			     MALCOLM
		Hello again.

	He looks down and studies Malcolm.

			     COLE
		You been running around?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."

			     COLE
		It makes you feel better?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes" again.

			     COLE
		I like to run around.  It's good
		exercise.
			(beat)
		You want to ask me questions now?

	Malcolm shakes his head, "No."

			     COLE
		You want to be a lance corporal in
		Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th
		Marines?  We're being dispatched to
		the Quang Nam province.

	Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he
	understands now.


			     MALCOLM
		Maybe later.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Something happened, didn't it?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, it did.

			     COLE
		Are you wigging out?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, I am.

			     COLE
		We're not gonna start crying again,
		are we?

			     MALCOLM
		No, we're not.

			     COLE
		What happened?

	Beat.

	Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		These people...  People that died
		and are still hanging around.
		Maybe they weren't ready to go.

	Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face.

			     COLE
		You really look better.

			     MALCOLM
		 Maybe they wake up that morning
		 thinking they have a thousand
		 things to do and a thousand days
		 left to do them in...  And then
		 all of a sudden, it's all taken
		 away.  No one asked them.  It's
		 just gone...

			     COLE
		You have nice red in your cheeks now.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you know what 'Yo no quiero
		morir' is?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's Spanish.  It means...  'I
		don't want to die.'
			(beat)
		Not all the ghosts are scary, are
		they?  Like Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
		No.

			     MALCOLM
		What do those ghosts want when they
		talk to you?  Think real careful
		now, Cole...

	Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just help.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes!  I think that's right!...  I
		think they all want that.  Even the
		scary ones...

			     COLE
		You believe now?

	Malcolm's stare is unwavering.

			     MALCOLM
		I believe both of you now.
			(beat)
		And I think I might know how to
		make them go away.

			     COLE
		You do?

	Malcolm nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		I think they know you're one of
		those guys rare people can see them.
			(beat)
		You need to help them.  Each one of
		them.
			(beat)
		Everyone wants to be heard.
		Everyone.

	Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

			     COLE
		What if they don't want help?  What
		if they're just angry and they want
		to hurt somebody?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't think that's the way it
		works, Cole.

	Cole looks nervous.

			     COLE
		How do you know for sure?

	Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under
	his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't.

	Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back
	of the church.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges
	with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a
	complete stop.

	Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his
	house is SEAN.

	Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the
	front stairs and starts across the street.

	A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

	Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure
	closing in on him.

	THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean
	pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

	Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and
	overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm stands in his foyer.

	Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away
	from the front.

	Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the
	phone.

			     ANNA
		...You just walked out.  You're
		probably on your way home.  I'm
		leaving this message...  I just
		didn't get to say what I meant...
			(beat)
		I know you're confused.  It's just...
		I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.
			(beat)
		I don't want to be ashamed of that.
		I don't want to have to make
		excuses for that.
			(beat)
		And I wanted to tell you...  I
		bought your present wholesale from
		a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on
		it.  You don't need someone cheap
		like that.
			(beat)
		By the way, it's a non-refundable
		item, it's scratched on the bottom.
			(beat)
		Are you smiling?...  I hope you're
		smiling.
			(beat)
		I'll see you at the store.

	Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.

	Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.

	His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE
	STAIRS.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	The house is silent.  No movement.

	Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.

	Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by
	statues and pictures.

	Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

			     LYNN
		Cole...
			(beat)
		Cole, what's happening...

	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
	folds to the ground.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
	open his mother's bedroom door.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
	machine fills the other side of the room.

	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's happening to you?

	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

			     LYNN
		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll
		beat their asses.

	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
	face with his tiny fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Momma, you sleep now.

	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her
	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

							COT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands
	still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

	HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

	Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time
	intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the
	suddenly ice cold air.

	Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He
	takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the
	hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in
	a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before
	entering the tent.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

	AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She
	finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --
	tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he
	tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living
	room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-
	legged couch.

	Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole
	presses as far back as he can and waits.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.
	Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

	Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He
	takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign
	of movement.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He
	stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

	BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --
	fights it back.

	He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off
	the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at
	Cole.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better.

	Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole
	holds her stare with trembling eyes.

	He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out.

			     COLE
		Do you want to tell me something?

							CUT TO:

	INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

	A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the
	spattering of passengers.

	They're both wearing suits.

	Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.
	Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an
	entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM
	WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL
	WEEDS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  HE HOBBLES HIS WAY DESPERATELY
	TOWARDS THE BUS.  HIS HANDS AND LEGS ARE SHACKLED...  HE LUNGES
	OUT FOR COLE IN THE PASSING WINDOW.

			     SHACKLED MAN
		My name's not Sullivan!

	A GUNSHOT ECHOES IN THE AIR.  THE MAN'S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED AS
	HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES SCREAMING.

	Cole jerks back from the window.

	The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.

	Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		She came a long way to visit me,
		didn't she?

			     MALCOLM
		I guess she did.

	Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress
	shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.

	The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets
	working its way downtown.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed
	carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto
	the streets.

	People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the
	front door of the home.

	Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards
	the doors.

	A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress
	on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her
	as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

			     MALCOLM
		Her little sister?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others
	into the modest corner home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is
	standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED
	CONVERSATIONS.

			     VISITOR #1
		...can you imagine being a child in
		a bed for two years?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #2
		...I think it was six.

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #3
		...Six separate doctors?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #4
			(whispers)
		...the little one's falling ill now...

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #5
		...God help them...

	A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one
	bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother
	and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

	Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
	Waiting.

	The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to
	Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear
	upstairs.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.
	stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being
	taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.

	Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His
	eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
	hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		I wish I were somewhere else.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		Where will you go, where no one has
		died?

	Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Don't go home, okay?

			     MALCOLM
		I definitely won't.

	Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time
	before reaching for the doorknob.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the
	girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The
	walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
	friends, and school children.

	Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of
	puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
	a mini tripod sitting next to it.

	Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He
	places it in his pocket.

	On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
	The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
	Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

	Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
	closets.  He passes the bed.

	AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS
	COLE'S ANKLE.

	Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips
	back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing
	happens.

	He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his
	head and looks under the bed.

	The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
	floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.
	Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor
	and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at
	each other.  Neither of them say a word.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the
	GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves
	through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
	hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins
	leaves the living room.

	Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
	through the many adults across the room.

	The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
	is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is
	granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares
	statue-like at an abstract point in the room.

			     COLE
		Mister?

	The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the
	little boy standing before the man.

			     COLE
		Excuse me, Mister.

	Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing
	next to him.  Cole is very shaky.

	Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

	Cole stares at Mr. Collins.

			     COLE
		Are you Kyra's daddy?

	The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

	Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.

	The father just stares at it.  Beat.

			     COLE
		It's for you...
			(beat)
		She wanted to tell you something.

	The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of
	confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches
	and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

	Cole begins to back away...

	The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole
	reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

	The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry
	box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch
	and open the box.

	Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.
	Collins is seated now.

	THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE.
	TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE.  WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE
	PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.

	Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he
	watches the performance.

	The entire room has stopped what they were doing.

	T.V. SCREEN

	WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.
	The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.
	We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her
	desk in the corner.

	Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door
	opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a
	sandwich.

	LIVING ROOM

	The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his
	eyes off of the screen.

	The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the
	fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.

	And then it happens.

	The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An
	assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
	She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the
	ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the
	cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.
	Checks it.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		That's too much.

	The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into
	the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back
	in the closet.

	The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She
	places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over
	the bed.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Kyra, time for lunch.

	Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The image of the mother smiles.

			     MRS. COLLINGS
			(video tape)
		I'm glad, honey.
			(beat)
		Time for your food.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		Can I go outside, if I eat this?

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		We'll see.  You know how you get
		sick in the afternoon.

	Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at
	the taste.  She looks up at her mother.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Don't say it tastes funny.  You
		know I don't like to hear that.

	Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another
	spoonful.

	The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He
	presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.

	The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends
	and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the
	table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.

	She looks up.

	Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A
	group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.

	Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.

	Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

			     MR. COLLINS
			(soft)
		You were keeping her sick...

	The whole world stops.

	The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow
	realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.

	She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage
	filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his
	cheeks.

	Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She
	concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to
	shake.


			     MRS. COLLINS
			(to no one)
		I took care of her...

	Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream
	down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand
	tumble to the floor.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She
	doesn't look up.

	Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

	Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER
	PUPPET.  He holds it out.

			     COLE
		You liked it, she said.

	The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes
	it in her small hands.

	The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances
	to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has
	ceased.

	Cole turns to the four-year-old.

			     COLE
		She watched out for you.

	The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

			FOUR YEAR OLD
		Kyra's not coming back.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Not anymore.

	The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly
	places a hand on her shoulder.

	Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

	Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One
	mourning.  One consoling.

	Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop
	room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and
	then knocks.  After a second, he enters.

	Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a
	FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.
	Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		They're calling for the stable boy.

	Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who were you talking to?

	The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		Poor Stanley.

	She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt
	horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		My favorite student.

	THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN MOVES PAST MR. CUNNINGHAM IN THE DOORWAY.
	SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

	Cole puts on his tattered hat.

			     COLE
		Thanks for giving me this part, Mr.
		Cunningham.

	Mr. Cunningham smiles.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You're welcome, Cole.

	They share a look before walking out of the prop room and
	entering the hall.

	We see them walking away.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You know when I was in school,
		there was a terrible fire in this
		section of the theater.  They
		rebuilt the whole thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I know.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he
	scurries up the stairs of the school.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.
	Anthony's Academy.

	A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

			     MALCOLM
		Has the play started yet?

	The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying
	a word.

			     MALCOLM
		Is that a yes?

	The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her
	curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.
	He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

	The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed
	children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down
	costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

	A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
	where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE
	sticks out of the top.

	The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

	Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's
	costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

			     MERLIN
		Only he who is pure of heart can
		take the sword from the stone.

	Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

			     MERLIN
		Let the boy try.

	The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

	Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops
	around, clearly embarrassed.

			     TOMMY
			(half-heartedly)
		But he's the stable boy.  He cleans
		after the horses.

			     MERLIN
		Silence village idiot!  Let the boy
		step forward.

	Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

	Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

			     MERLIN
		Arthur...

	Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.
	It takes him a moment before he steps forward.

	Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the
	handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

	The villagers GASP.

	Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his
	head.

	Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE
	AUDITORIUM.

	Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light
	for the first time.

	The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry
	him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then
	starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try
	unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then
	collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle
	themselves.

	Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable
	among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying
	themselves on stage.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

	The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass
	window.

	Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and
	forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

			     COLE
		How come we're so quiet?

	Malcolm shrugs his shoulders.

			     MALCOLM
		I think we said everything we
		needed to say.
			(beat)
		Maybe it's time to say things to
		someone else?  Someone close to you?

			     COLE
		Maybe.

	Cole keeps moving.  Beat.

			     COLE
		I'm not going to see you anymore,
		am I?

	Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, "No."
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You were great in the play, Cole.

			     COLE
		Really?

			     MALCOLM
		And you know what else?

			     COLE
		What?

			     MALCOLM
		Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

	Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he
	continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't
	want to be still.

			     COLE
		...Maybe we can pretend we're going
		to see each other tomorrow?

	Cole glances at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just for pretend.

	Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.
	Cole stops moving.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		See you tomorrow.

	Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He
	doesn't turn to look back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

	A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around
	a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk
	and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out
	by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars
	as they crawl by.

	Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

	Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare
	through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield
	wipers.

			     LYNN
		I hope nobody got hurt.

	Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently.

			     LYNN
		You're very quiet.
			(beat)
		You're mad I missed the play,
		aren't you?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     LYNN
		I have two jobs, baby.  You know
		how important they are for us.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		I'd give anything to have been
		there.

			     COLE
		I'm ready to communicate with you
		now.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Communicate?

			     COLE
		Tell you my secrets.

	The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

	Cole takes a long time.

			     COLE
		You know that accident up there?

			     LYNN
			(confused)
		Yeah.

			     COLE
		Someone got hurt.

			     LYNN
		They did?

			     COLE
		A lady.  She died.

			     LYNN
		Oh my God.

	Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield
	with her palm to see better.

			     LYNN
		You can see her?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.
	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Where is she?

			     COLE
		Standing next to my window.

	A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES, HELMET CRACKED, HAIR MATTED WITH
	RAIN AND BLOOD, STANDS STARING THROUGH COLE'S PASSENGER WINDOW.

	Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his
	window.  She eyes Cole.

			     LYNN
		Cole, you're scaring me.

			     COLE
		They scare me too sometimes.

			     LYNN
		They?

			     COLE
		Dead people.

			     LYNN
		Dead people?

			     COLE
		Ghosts.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		You see ghosts, Cole?

			     COLE
		They want me to do things for them.

			     LYNN
		They talk to you?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     LYNN
		They tell you to do things?

	Cole nods "Yes" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave
	understanding.  Cole watches her.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		...I don't know.

			     COLE
		You think I'm a freak?

	Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole gazes at her intense expression.

			     LYNN
		I would never think that about you
		...  ever... Got it?

			     COLE
		Got it.

	BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down.

			     LYNN
		Just let me think for a second.

	She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Grandma says hi.

	Lynn looks up sharply.

			     COLE
		She says she's sorry for taking the
		bumble bee pendant.  She just likes
		it a lot.

			     LYNN
		What?

			     COLE
		Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

	Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,
	her words are extremely controlled.

			     LYNN
		Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's
		gone.  You know that.

			     COLE
		I know.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you--

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		Cole, please stop.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you, she saw
		you dance.

	Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.

			     COLE
		She said when you were little, you
		and her had a fight right before
		your dance recital.  You thought
		she didn't come to see you dance.
		She did.

	Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.

			     COLE
		She hid in the back so you wouldn't
		see...  She said you were like an
		angel.

	Lynn begins to cry.

			     COLE
		She said, you came to her where
		they buried her.  Asked her a
		question...  She said the answer is
		"Everyday."

	Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through
	her fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What did you ask?

	Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Do I make her proud?

	Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother
	and son hold each other tight.

	WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER
	WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND
	HIS MOTHER.

	WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE
	SIDEWALK.  WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

	Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,
	she looks like a little girl.

	Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

	Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE
	CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.

	Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.
	He gazes upon his wife softly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Anna, I've been so lost.
			(beat)
		I need my best friend.

	Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

			     ANNA
		I miss you.

	Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.
	ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.

	Malcolm can't believe it.

			     MALCOLM
		I miss you.

	Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

			     ANNA
		Why, Malcolm?

			     MALCOLM
		What, Anna?  What did I do?  What's
		made you so sad?

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		Why did you leave me?

			     MALCOLM
		I didn't leave you.

	Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her
	arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE
	GROUND.

	Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes
	curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

	Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An
	identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

	Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS
	GONE.

	Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks
	around in confusion...

	His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He
	looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

	Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are
	drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on
	the tabletop.

	His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO
	PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His
	eyes fill with a storm of emotions...

	Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

	CLOSE ON ANNA...  TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME...  IT'S
	NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING
	TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

			     MALCOLM
			(like he's falling
			 down a deep hole)
		No...

							SLAM CUT:

	FLASHBACK:  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.

	Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the
	floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

	Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his
	shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF
	BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his
	side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower
	back pours out blood uncontrollably.

	Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

	ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.

	Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then
	becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands
	desperately.

							SLAM CUT:

	PRESENT:  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

			     MALCOLM
			(screaming)
		     ANNA!

	MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.

	Anna just sleeps.

	Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.

	He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and
	suddenly becomes very still.

	Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her
	shut eyes.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't cry.

	Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.

			     MALCOLM
		I think I have to go.

	Malcolm's mind is racing.

			     MALCOLM
			(realizing)
		I just needed to do a couple of
		things.
			(beat)
		And I needed to tell you something.

			     ANNA
		Tell me.

	Beat.
			     MALCOLM
		You were never second...  Ever.

	Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		You sleep now, Anna.  Everything
		will be different in the morning.

	Anna lays still.

			     ANNA
		Goodnight, Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

	The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his
	wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.

	Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They
	close shut.

	WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA...  WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY
	CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...

	WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE...  THE ROOM
	BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.

	SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL.  SHE BREATHES GENTLY,
	FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.

	THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES...  MALCOLM IS AT THE
	MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS.  HE'S
	HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		...I think I've had too much to
		drink.

	Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they
	watch.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I just have to say, this day today
		has been one very special day...
		I wish we all could stay and play.

	The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What?

	Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.

	Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I never thought I'd feel the
		things I'm feeling.  I never
		thought I'd be able to stand up in
		front of my friends and family and
		tell them what's inside me...
		Today I can...

	Malcolm's eyes fill with water.

			     MALCOLM
			(softly)
		Anna Crowe...  I am in love.  In
		love I am.

							FADE TO BLACK:

				THE END
