FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

THE GRANDFATHER

Suddenly passionate.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            5.


BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -hold it, hold it-

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen, perking
                  up a little)
             -- murdered by pirates is good --

CLOSE UP: Buttercup, staring out the window of her room.

                  (off-screen)
             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,
standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three
others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the
aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the
Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (raises his hands,
                  starts to speak)
             My people ... a month from now,
             our country will have its 500th
             anniversary. On that sundown, I
             shall marry a lady who was once a
             commoner like yourselves --
                  (pause)
             -- but perhaps you will not find
             her common now. Would you like to
             meet her?

And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder.

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just
begins to become visible,

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.

                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.


                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

                                            CUT TO:

A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."
Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN

             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart

slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...

As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                  (off-screen)

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,

Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

                                            CUT TO:

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            9.


A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

             We're past that, Grandpa.

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.

And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.

Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

                         GRANDFATHER
             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.

                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

                                            CUT TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.


                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.

                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

A DIAL

Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN
             This being our first try, I'll
             use the lowest setting.

And he turns the dial to "1".

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens
the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

WESTLEY

and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the
chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

                         RUGEN
             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

AND NOW, AT LAST:

WESTLEY

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

                         RUGEN
             Interesting.

in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all
over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in
the doorway.

             Yellin.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Any word from Westley?

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Too soon, my angel. Patience.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

                  (sharpening his dagger)
             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we

             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN
                  (bows, exits)
             Your Majesties.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring at Humperdinck.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           84.


                         BUTTERCUP
             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart
             full of fear.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (close to erupting;
                  speaks very distinctly)
             I-would-not-say-such things-if-
             Iwere-you-

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why not? You can't hurt me.
             Westley and I are joined by the
             bonds of love. And you cannot
             track that. Not with a thousand
             bloodhounds. And you cannot break
             it. Not with a thousand swords.
             And when I say you are a coward,
             that is only because you are the
             slimiest weakling ever to crawl
             the earth.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull
her along, out of control, his words indistinct.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU!

                                            CUT TO:

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room,
slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.

                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               With the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass:

               FADE UP ON:

               A howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny 
               woodplank church.

               Inside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a 
               small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they 
               kneel in prayer.

               Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in 
               the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of 
               his casket.

               He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now 
               with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of 
               desert wind, moaning through thin wood.

               The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless 
               gusts, strains for life, then goes out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

               It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A 
               place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting 
               fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad 
               drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure 
               enters.

               Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he 
               pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the 
               flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican 
               radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, 
               catches his gaze.

               There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated 
               figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the 
               window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, 
               on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve 
               the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle 
               perched on the railing. Watching the window.

               The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's 
               movement behind the window.

               The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up 
               to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.

               BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW

               Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's 
               been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a 
               tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets 
               on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary 
               column.

               Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body 
               stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it 
               EXPLODES into fragments.

               The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon 
               spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two 
               STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.

               Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the 
               back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his 
               locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING 
               Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.

               The two, across the room for each other, pause.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         Where is it?

               Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now 
               walking slow circles around each other.

                                     SIMON
                         Leave me alone.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         You've found it, haven't you?

                                     SIMON
                         Fuck you.

               The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, 
               who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.

               The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's 
               leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon 
               up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging 
               his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first 
               plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even 
               further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --

               -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over 
               and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one 
               side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around 
               and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame 
               and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a 
               shard of glass through his neck.

               Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's 
               sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing 
               his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the 
               gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.

               The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-
               eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.

               Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.

               The gargoyle's a wreck.

               But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every 
               inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his 
               feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to 
               stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-
               speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.

               The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into 
               a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, 
               bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's 
               windshield.

               THREE FLOORS ABOVE

               Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at 
               the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own 
               shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing 
               is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks 
               that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of 
               his nose.

               At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly 
               finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an 
               oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage 
               beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.

               A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being 
               photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police 
               investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The 
               usual.

               A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, 
               thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple 
               of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting 
               to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.

                                     THOMAS DAGGET
                         Hey.

                                     BURROWS
                         Hey.

                              (looks up at sky)
                         Thought those clouds this morning 
                         spelled rain for sure, but it's turned 
                         into a beautiful day, wouldn't you 
                         say, Sergeant Burrows?

               Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath. Burrows just stares at 
               him.

                                     BURROWS
                         I warned you about that cheerful 
                         shit.

                         Sorry. I'm working on it.

               He eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle.

                                     BURROWS
                         Friend here did a half-gainer with a 
                         firebird tuck from the third floor.

                                     BURROWS
                         Not unless he decided not to bother 
                         opening the window first.

                                     BURROWS
                         Well, he wasn't exactly in a condition 
                         to walk a chalk line when we got 
                         here. You're welcome to try and smell 
                         his breath if you like, that is if 
                         you can find the mouth.

                         On their way. Willie promises a white 
                         paper tomorrow. Or Wednesday,

               Burrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man

                         Pedro. First thing he remembers about 
                         the deceased is several vital organs

                                                        DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

               The sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating 
               expanse of desert.

               Travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens 
               and silhouettes tall, finger-like spires of volcanic rock. 
               Hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing 
               search. Before the night swallows it all whole,

               Come upon The Town.

               It used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped 
               in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell 
               of a place.

               Lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. 
               The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting 
               for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the 
               desert.

               The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up 
               storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of 
               abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite 
               twists slowly on a power line.

               ON THE EDGE OF TOWN

               From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

               Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An 
               icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was 
               meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems 
               to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this 
               night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner 
               and the faint sound of children's voices in song.

               It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty 
               of voices rising and falling in choir.

               INSIDE THE BUILDING

               Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are 
               twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing 
               together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their 
               acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the 
               huge room, look on.

               OUTSIDE

               The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against 
               the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.

               INSIDE

               The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the 
               flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old 
               general we saw at the opening.

               THE FRONT DOOR

               Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. 
               A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain 
               of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides 
               them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. 
               Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their 
               mouths.

               One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a 
               special smile of special friendship from Katherine.

               THE MORTUARY'S

               Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of 
               glass glisten in the carpet.

               INSIDE

               Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and 
               death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.

               It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize 
               someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus 
               jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if 
               in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his 
               breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind 
               sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the 
               amber glow.

               Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the 
               General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. 
               Concentration.

               Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on 
               his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.

               IN THE MORTUARY

               Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and 
               deeply weary,

                                     SIMON
                         Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...

               Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, 
               the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children 
               and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, 
               crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.

               OUTSIDE

               Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty 
               through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for 
               support.

               AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, 
               Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out 
               into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates. Knows.

               Katherine follows her out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Hey bright eyes, what's the deal 
                         being out here all alone without a 
                         coat?

               The girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. Too 
               perceptive.

                                     MARY
                         Someone's here.

               Katherine looks out into the night.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Where?

               Mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, 
               smiling and popping Katherine one on the arm.

                                     MARY
                         Pig out on all the cake?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny 
                         piece left, but you're gonna have to 
                         race me for it.

               Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.

                                     MARY
                         What's that?

               When Katherine turns Mary dashes back into the building.

                                     MARY
                         Ha!

                                     KATHERINE
                         You little sneak!

               Katherine chases after her.

               AT THAT MOMENT

               Simon comes limping up from the road. His breathing's bad 
               now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming 
               to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.

               INSIDE

               He climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer 
               bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor.

               It's part of the school building long abandoned. Doors to 
               classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, 
               rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres.

               Simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles 
               along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut 
               in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. He crawls 
               into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on 
               himself and sucks his thumb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. APARTMENT

               Thomas Dagget's eyes opening slowly. He sits up in his bed, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and looks out with only medium 
               enthusiasm at the morning.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief, 
               silent prayer. He crosses himself, stands, and walks for the 
               door. Before leaving he glances back at the altar. A 
               questioning moment between two akward, estranged friends.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE

               A set of golf clubs rest forelornly in the corner. An 
               irritable looking coroner fumes behind his desk as Thomas 
               enters.

                         No, he never had any eyes. We checked 
                         the sockets. There's no optic nerve, 
                         muscle pores, loose viscus, nothing.

                         We also did a toxicology on his blood:

                         We also did a bone section. Wasn't 
                         that much trouble since most of them 
                         were sticking out of his chest anyway.

                         When babies grow up their bones get

                         the interior haversham canals. Child

                         rings in the bone. Everybody has 
                         them -- except your man. That would, 
                         to a hasty observer, seem to indicate 
                         he had never been a child.

               The coroner opens his desk and pulls out a small, ancient 
               looking leather bound book.

               INT. POLICE OFFICE

               Thomas at his desk, working under a lone gooseneck lamp. 
               He's translating the fourteenth chapter of St. John's 
               Revelations from Latin onto a slip of paper. Finished, he 
               sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and 
               leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING

               Here, outside The Town, horizons are distant, faraway things. 
               The sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning 
               as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open. 
               It's Katherine, the teacher. Wearing levis and boots, she 
               carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral 
               behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies 
               impatiently.

                                     KATHERINE
                         In a minute, in a minute...

               Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it 
               down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs, 
               begins to heat up the sky.

               EXT. SANDSTONE CANYON - MORNING

               Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone 
               walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A 
               tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked 
               sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from 
               anything but the approach of galloping hooves.

               Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the 
               clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. 
               Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their 
               hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.

               Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind-
               cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain 
               lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient 
               buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high 
               on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen, 
               staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as 
               Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of 
               the canyon, and onto the main plateau.

               ON THE PLATEAU

               Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. 
               She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some 
               old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, 
               greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.

               There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered 
               school bus rattles its way past and stops. The bus driver, a 
               Navaho, JOHN, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head 
               painfully walks up to Katherine.

                                     JOHN
                         You could save my life with some 
                         coffee.

               He holds out an empty cup Katherine fills. Sipping painfully, 
               he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball 
               cap over his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Tough night?

                                     JOHN
                         You don't want to hear about it.
                              (peeks out hopefully)
                         Or maybe you do.

                                     KATHERINE
                         No thanks.

                                     JOHN
                         Just checking.

               The bus is full of young school kids.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Shouldn't they be getting to school?

                                     JOHN
                         Impromptu field trip. I'm broadening 
                         their minds. And sparing them the 
                         sight of their beloved chauffeur 
                         barfing his guts out.

               Katherine's horse snorts.

                                     JOHN
                         I hate horses. How was the canyon?

                                     JOHN
                         I hate that canyon. I hate this this 
                         whole plateau. Too many goddamn

               He finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet.

                         You're a credit to the community.

               He shuffles back to the bus.

                         This is a school day! And no talking 
                         loud!

               The bus coughs alive and crawls forward. Katherine waves to 
               the faces behind glass, then settles back for a last moment 
               of peace as silence lays again over the land.

               EXT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Showered and changed into her teaching clothes, Katherine 
               climbs into a rattling pickup.

               EXT. THE TOWN

               Katherine drives to work, passing on the outskirts the closed 
               copper mine, vast and abandoned. Down beyond the fading main 
               street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school. 
               Katherine parks her truck, grabs her leather bag, and walks 
               in.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Katherine's lecturing her students. All twenty-five of them. 
               There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls 
               on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being 
               taught together in one room.

               It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on 
               her lap.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus 
                         was a herbavore, which meant he only 
                         ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly 
                         to himself and never bothered anyone.

               The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine 
               holds up another bone fragment.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is a leg fragment that belongs 
                         to the killer of the plateau, 
                         Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious 
                         carnivore, which meant he'd eat 
                         anything that moved, especially nice, 
                         juicy Camposaurs.

               The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Both these guys lived together right 
                         here on the White Rock plateau eighty 
                         million years ago, when this area 
                         used to be on the banks of a huge, 
                         shallow sea. Remember how we talked 
                         about how sedimentation fossilizes 
                         bones? That's also what made the 
                         hills out behind our town and put 
                         the copper in the ground.

                                     HIGH SCHOOL KID
                         Lot of good that did us.

               Katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter 
               and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at 
               the dino bone.

                                     BOY
                         It's radioactive! Like Godzilla!

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know 
                         why? Uranium, that's the rock they 
                         use in nuclear power plants --

                                     BOY
                         And bombs!

                                     KATHERINE
                         And bombs Alex, yes, is all through 
                         these hills naturally. Millions of 
                         years ago the dinosaurs here ate 
                         plants and drank water which had 
                         uranium in it that became concentrated 
                         in their bones, which is exactly 
                         how, with Mr. Geiger counter here, 
                         we're going to find some.

               The class CHEERS.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               With the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's 
               class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind 
               the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with 
               the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a 
               shoving match with a little girl.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (coming between them)
                         -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal, 
                         Brian?

               The girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed, 
               embarrassed.

                                     BRIAN
                         She...

                                     KATHERINE
                         Yes?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...She, she called me a "Dick Head".

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, he is.

                                     KATHERINE
                         All right, Brian. You get one free 
                         insult. Make it good.

               Brian concentrates.

                                     PAUL
                         You... You're a... Cow Demon!

                                     KATHERINE
                              (beat)
                         Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied?
                              (looks at Brian)
                         Cow Demon?

               UP ON THE HILL

               Katherine's given the geiger counter to the little Navaho 
               girl, Mary. Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, 
               Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it 
               begins clicking softly.

                                     MARY
                         I got one! I got one!

               The high school kids come up and help dig.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Easy... Easy... Don't break it.

               Almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust.

               As the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine 
               looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up 
               onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BIG CITY CHURCH

               It's mostly empty at this time of day and the young man 
               sitting in the pew, staring at the altar, is alone. His name 
               is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and 
               dark sunglasses, even inside. His thin hair is slicked back 
               and there's an almost feminine quality about him.

               He sits there a moment longer, staring, then gets up and 
               leaves.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY

               The alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old, 
               convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse.

               INT. FLOPHOUSE

               He comes upstairs to the landing, where the door to the room 
               is covered with a strip of yellow tape: POLICE INVESTIGATION. 
               DO NOT ENTER.

               Gabriel pulls the tape aside and KICKS the door open.

               INSIDE

               It's still the disaster we remember. Gabriel walks slowly 
               through the room. He scratches up some blood, tastes it.

               There's spray-painted outlines where the police have removed 
               certain items. Gabriel takes note of this, tastes the blood 
               again, and leaves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. KATHERINE'S CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               It's lunch break. Most of the students sit in loose cliques 
               around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope, 
               picking fights.

               INSIDE

               The recently unearthed skull sits on Katherine's desk. Feet 
               up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a 
               dinosaur book. One of her students, a twelve year old boy, 
               finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.

                                     BOY
                         I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss 
                         Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.

                                     BOY
                              (looking at book over 
                              her shoulder)
                         Find out what it is, yet?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Well, it's either a 44 million year 
                         old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr. 
                         Sorenson lost last winter.

               The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous. 
               Slowly, he lets his weight rest against Katherine's shoulder. 
               She smiles good naturedly up at him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go eat your lunch, Jason.

               The boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up, almost 
               relieved.

                                     BOY
                         Sure, Miss Henley. Thanks. See ya.

               Katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to 
               the book.

               AROUND THE BACK OF THE BUILDING

               On the abandoned back stairs, a couple of Mexican boys sit 
               smoking cigarettes. They whistle and kid with the four young 
               girls that pass them going up the steps.

               UPSTAIRS

               Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. The four 
               girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably 
               half the fun. They run through the crumbling halls, giggling 
               and hiding from one another. Their cries, the smack of their 
               shoes, echo off off the peeling halls.

               One of them is Mary, running down a hall, banging a stick 
               with another girl. At a corner Mary peels off from her friend, 
               runs down a new hall, turns a corner,

               And comes on Simon. He's still curled where we last saw him, 
               in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. The two 
               stare at one another. Finally,

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hi.

                                     MARY
                         What's your name?

                                     SIMON
                         Simon.

                                     MARY
                         You don't look so good, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         No, I don't.

                                     MARY
                         I'm Mary.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Does Miss Henley know you're here?

                                     SIMON
                         No one does, Mary. Can we keep it 
                         just our secret. For a little while?

               Mary thinks.

                                     MARY
                         Okay.

               You can hear her friends coming closer.

                                     MARY
                         I have to go.

                                     SIMON
                         It was nice meeting you, Mary.

               Mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.

                                     MARY
                         Are you hungry? I could bring 
                         something.

                                     SIMON
                         That would be very nice.

                                     MARY
                         Okay. Bye.

               She smiles and runs down the hall. Simon grits his teeth, 
               turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long 
               day.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               An old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, 
               now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young 
               man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking 
               down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's 
               stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.

               THE APARTMENT INSIDE

               Hasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the 
               occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the 
               floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem 
               to register his visitor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Gee Jerry, you look like shit.

               The eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face 
               eaten with dried sores.

                                     JERRY
                         Leave me alone, Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Soon, pal. Soon.

               Gabriel drops into the chair across from Jerry and pushes 
               aside with distaste the maggot-ridden plates of food piled 
               on the table. He reaches his hand out to Jerry.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Come here.

                                     JERRY
                         Go away.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (sing-song, like to a 
                              baby)
                         Come here...

               Gabriel puts his hand under Jerry's chin and turns the face 
               side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy 
               eyes.

                         Fuck you.

               Gabriel releases Jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         There's something I want you to do 
                         for me.

               A dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of 
               Jerry's pant leg.

                                     GABRIEL

               A tear wells in Jerry's decomposing face.

               The SLAM of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of 
               an indoor court. It ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back 
               glass partition, and is SLAMMED again. Four players, including 
               Thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. It's 
               brutal. Shoulders and knees bang off one another.

               One of the players falls back, yells to Thomas.

                                     PLAYER
                         Cover me! Cover me!

               Thomas dives into position to make the save, recovers, and 
               yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner.

                         Pop it up!

               The player SLAMS it brutally at Thomas, who misses miserably.

                         Thanks a lot.

               Another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around 
               Thomas.

                                     PLAYER #2
                         You're missing the point of the game, 
                         Thomas. You must absolutely trust no 
                         one. Form alliances, but break them. 
                         Lure another to trust you, then betray 
                         him! You play with too much honor. 
                         Sink to the gutter. Use people. Lie 
                         and double-cross them.

               Player #2 tosses the ball to Thomas, who serves, and the 
               scuffling is back on. Shouts to one another. Promises of 
               support.

                                     PLAYER #2
                         Come on Thomas, let's take out Sam 
                         together!

               Thomas and Player #2 team up on a third player, pressing him 
               hard. Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and 
               drives against Player #2. The about-face is too abrupt for 
               him and Player #2 is eliminated in a double-cross. He smiles 
               proudly at Thomas.

                                     PLAYER #2
                         Magnificent decadence.

               INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM

               Thomas and the three players congratulate each other on the 
               evil and treachery in each other's strategies as they shower 
               down.

                                     PLAYER #1
                         The important thing, Tom, is seeing 
                         the game for what it is.

                                     PLAYER #2
                         A sickening, hopeless, giant sucking 
                         hole of depravity.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM DRESSING AREA

               As Thomas combs his hair and slips on his regimental 
               detective's suit 'n tie, the other three put on their black 
               pants, shirts, and stiff white Roman collars. They're priests.

               Two of the priests hoist their gym bags and head for the 
               door.

                                     PRIEST #1

                         "And as in the first war, the angels 
                         so fought over the nature of their 
                         God, and there was much vanity and 
                         destruction in heaven. For some angels

                         Theologically, The "first war" 
                         obviously refers to the war in heaven 
                         where Michael the archangel threw 
                         out Satan and his gang. Old time 
                         bible stuff. But this implies there 
                         was a second war. That's news to me.

                         Oh, it's a fairly common theological 
                         debate. Or was. The idea that if 
                         Christ is God's son, does that make 
                         him less than God or are they the 
                         same being in different forms. That 
                         very argument almost tore the early 
                         Christian church apart in the 4th 
                         Century. That was the good old days 
                         when people actually worried about 
                         theology. Anyway, it was settled 
                         when the bishops of the world got to 
                         together at the Council of Nicene in 
                         325 and hashed out the various 
                         interpretations of scripture into a 
                         uniform dogma of belief. The result 
                         was the Nicene Creed, which basically 
                         said that Christ was in fact the 
                         same as God and was owed the same 
                         power and respect as the Father. 
                         That they were the same.

                         John. It's possible I suppose. John 
                         always was a little negative about 
                         angels. All this actually has 
                         something to do with an LAPD murder?

               EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

               The building is squat and brick. A non-descrip warehouse 
               that subs as a police evidence storage area.

               The sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large-
               brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very 
               well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed 
               flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He 
               shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that 
               gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind 
               shiny wet footprints like a snail.

               There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's 
               shrunken claws pull it open.

               INSIDE

               Is a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All 
               of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and 
               million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's 
               all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives 
               forgotten.

               Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works 
               his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets 
               looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the 
               third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box 
               and walks out.

               INT. COUNTY BUILDING BASEMENT

               Gabriel steps off the elevator and follows the signs for 
               MEDICAL EXAMINER. Along the way he passes a checkpoint guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Need a pass, friend.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'll just be a second.

                                     GUARD
                         C'mon...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sorry.

               Gabriel walks back to the guard, smiles, and KNOCKS him clean 
               out of his chair with the back of his arm. The guard SMACKS 
               against the wall and crumples out of view.

               INT. MORGUE

               Tiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when 
               Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes 
               a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, 
               the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, 
               tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, 
               slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the 
               gargoyle.

               He's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the 
               eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the 
               floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the 
               arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a 
               small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and 
               hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he 
               draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and 
               walks for the door.

               In the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the 
               gargoyle BURST into flame.

               INT. KATHERINE'S SCHOOL

               Katherine's students are shuffling back from lunch to their 
               seats, making small talk and paper airplanes. Katherine does 
               a head count, then stops a young boy coming through the door.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Brian, have you seen Mary?

                                     BRIAN
                         I think she's out back somewhere.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to girl)
                         Allison?

                                     ALLISON
                         We haven't seen her since lunch.

                                     KATHERINE
                         We're you guys up in the...

               The girls, Mary's friends, shrug innocently. Katherine sighs.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Okay everybody, get started on today's 
                         reading. Quietly. I'll be right back.

               Katherine closes the door behind her. The class immediately 
               erupts into goofing off. The door opens again.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I mean quiet.

               IN THE ABANDONED PART OF THE BUILDING

               Katherine walks through decayed and rusting halls.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (calls out)
                         Mary...

               It's spooky up here. A part of the building Katherine clearly 
               dislikes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...
                              (to herself)
                         Shit.

               Katherine calls out Mary's name a few more times, turns a 
               few more corners, and suddenly comes on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary?

               Mary's sitting beside Simon, the bleeding, ashen-faced man 
               with sunglasses. She's giving Simon a piece of sandwich and 
               a coke. Katherine is instantly wary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary, come here.

                                     MARY
                         But Simon and I were --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Come here.

               Mary reluctantly walks over to Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go back to class.

                                     MARY
                         But --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go.

               Mary frowns, waves once to Simon, and leaves. There's a 
               heaviness to the air around Simon. A kind of buzzing. 
               Katherine blinks her eyes a few times. Focuses.

                                     SIMON
                         She wasn't doing any harm.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's not her I'm worried about.

                                     SIMON
                         Of course.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SIMON
                         Small job. Mostly done now. Just 
                         passing through.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is school property, you can't 
                         sleep here.

                                     SIMON
                         It wasn't part of the plan. Honest.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (notices blood stains)
                         Are you all right?

                                     SIMON
                         No. Not really.

               That buzz. Katherine rubs the side of her temple.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have to call the police.

                                     SIMON
                         I wish you wouldn't, but I understand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         They'll help you.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, I rather doubt that.

               Katherine turns and leaves, her footsteps fading. Mary appears 
               again.

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello. I thought you'd left.

                                     MARY
                         I hid. I'm very clever.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm sure you are.
                              (beat)
                         You were nice to give me the food.

                                     MARY
                         I know.

                                     SIMON
                         I haven't much time, Mary. And since 
                         you've been so nice to me, there's 
                         something I'd very much like to give 
                         to you.

                                     MARY
                         What?

                                     SIMON
                         Just for a little while. Something 
                         very special. Can you keep it a 
                         secret? The biggest secret ever?

                                     MARY
                         Yes. What is it?

                                     SIMON
                         Come here, Mary.

               She takes a couple of shy steps toward him.

                                     SIMON
                         Closer...

               As she does --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Katherine, outside the building, rounding up some of the 
               kids who decided to take an impromptu recess. Hustling the 
               last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly. She hears 
               something. Faint coughing.

               Katherine walks back around the side of the building and 
               sees Mary bent over, vomiting. Katherine rushes up to her.

                                     MARY
                         I don't feel good...

                                     KATHERINE
                         What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you 
                         eat something?
                              (concerned beat)
                         Did he give you something?

               Mary coughs up the last of her lunch.

                                     MARY
                         Can I go home now?

               Katherine wipes off Mary's mouth with a hanky.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sure, hon. Let's go.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives Mary home, a dusty, tired mobile home slumped 
               among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town.

               INT. MOBILE HOME

               Mary and Katherine pull open the door and enter. Mary's 
               elderly grandmother is sitting watching "All My Children". 
               She smiles at Katherine and looks at Mary with concern as 
               the little girl rubs her stomach and explains something in 
               Navaho.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Katherine helps tuck Mary in bed as her grandmother brings a 
               glass of water.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have the school send over a 
                         doctor.

               The grandmother sits beside Mary, whispers gently in Navaho, 
               and softly stokes her brow.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

                         He looked hurt.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Alone and tucked into bed, Mary stares off at something very, 
               very far away.

               On the floor is the smoldering, blackened outline of a body. 
               A thick, slimy goo gurgles and pops. The whole room is afoul

               Thomas jams his hands in his pockets and leans against an 
               autopsy table. Watches the smoke curl slowly up from the 
               impossibly melted goo in front of him.

               Gabriel crouches on the linoleum and pours everything out of 
               the evidence box onto the floor. He sifts through it, a smile 
               appearing when comes across the Chimney Rock Republican and 
               its circled obituary.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               On an utterly lonely blacktop, Gabriel shoots by in his top-
               down rambler, insignificant in the night's vastness. Jerry's 
               in the back, feet up on the seat.

                                     JERRY
                         Why do you need me? I can hardly 
                         walk now.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Some things are human work, son. 
                         Live or dead, human work. Besides, I 
                         like you.

                                     JERRY
                         Lucky moi.

               Gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler 
               to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is 
               instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs 
               out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled 
               among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The 
               Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.

               Gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can always smell a graveyard.

               Two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in 
               the dust nearby.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               On a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking 
               headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim 
               Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked 
               General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the 
               headstone over the grave like a winged creature.

                                     JERRY
                         I hope you're enjoying this.

                                     JERRY
                         But I did it, didn't I? I did kill 
                         myself.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well, yes. Technically.

                                     JERRY
                         And you're just keeping me alive.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Letting you die slower.

                                     JERRY
                         I'm so in your debt.

                         Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.

               Jerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away 
               the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry 
               removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, 
               pries open the lid.

               It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. 
               His medals flash in the moonlight.

                                     JERRY
                         Not much to look at.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ah, but it's not what's on the outside 
                         that matters --

               Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- It's what's on the inside.

               Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's 
               forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He 
               gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens

                              (upset)
                         It's not here.

               Gabriel frantically look in the ears. Up the nose.

                                     GABRIEL
                         It's not here!

                                     JERRY
                         Oooh, bad news for the war effort.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (spins wildly on him)
                         Shut up!!

               Gabriel BANGS the coffin lid in frustration. Tries to think.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now, if you were a soul, where would 
                         you hide?

                                     JERRY
                         The hell away from you.

               INT. THOMAS'S APARTMENT

               The numbers on the clock radio roll over five AM and the 
               news comes on. Thomas stirs in bed, rubs his eyes, and looks 
               out at a sky untouched by any sign of dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In coat and tie, Thomas sits in his spartan kitchen stirring 
               a coffee when the phone rings.

               Thomas looks up at his overnight bag, sitting half-packed on

               overnight bag.

               EXT. THE TOWN - NIGHT

               Silent and dead at this hour. Gabriel's boots creak on the 
               floorboards of the 19th century plank sidewalks. He taps his 
               finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Boy, what a dump, huh?

               Jerry, limping on a foot that's caving in on itself, wiping 
               the spinal fluid out of his dead eye, shuffles along behind.

               Gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk, grabs a parking meter 
               and swings himself playfully around.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Why can't this shit ever go down in 
                         Miami? Or Bora Bora? I feel like 
                         I've spent my whole damn stay in gin 
                         swills like this.

                                     JERRY
                         Life's a bitch.

               Gabriel suddenly freezes. He sticks his nose up, sniffs like 
               a coyote, then abruptly drops to the ground in a push-up and 
               smells the dirt. Tastes it with his tongue. Smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well well...

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               A fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows 
               and falls dully across shapes old, shapes forgotten, and one 
               shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor. 
               It's Simon; breath a rasp, blood-soaked pants leaving a long 
               smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail. He coughs, drags 
               an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses,

               And looks up at a pair of black, lizard-skin boots.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi, Simon.

               Simon rolls on his back and sighs.

                                     SIMON
                         Gabriel.

               Simon looks up at puss-faced Jerry, leaning quietly in a 
               dark corner.

                                     JERRY
                         Don't mind me. Just along for the 
                         ride.

               Gabriel sits down against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So, what shall we talk about? 
                         Theology?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm a little talked out on theology.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fair enough...

               Gabriel turns his boot to the moon, watches the pale light 
               glint back off the lizard scales.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know why I'm here.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh yes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't happen to have it on you by 
                         chance?

                                     SIMON
                         No.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That would have been too easy.

               Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet. Tries to escape. Jerry 
               trips him, SPRAWLING Simon back to the floor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Please, Simon. Get serious.

               Gabriel walks over to him. Puts his face close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now. Where's the soul?
                              (beat)
                         You know. So high. Used to reside in 
                         the recently departed General 
                         Hawthorne.

               Simon doesn't answer. Gabriel shrugs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Have it your way, big guy.

                                     SIMON
                         I do have one question.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shoot.

                                     SIMON
                         Do you even remember what this war's 
                         about?

               Gabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. Then he smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's hardly the point, is it?

                                     SIMON
                         I guess I never did get the point.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Happens.

                                     SIMON
                         How do you do it, Gabriel? How do 
                         you go on and on in this place?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I like it here, Simon. I always have.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm so tired...

               Gabriel grasps Simon's hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene 
                         Council. We were here first.

                                     SIMON
                         I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even 
                         know why anymore, but I can't.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know the routine.

                                     SIMON
                              (swallows hard)
                         Yes.

               Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, 
               claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until 
               Simon starts to bleed.

               Then to burn.

               INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound 
               of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or 
               her dreams.

               INT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               Gabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back 
               against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His 
               skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; 
               revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's 
               entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, 
               and stares into the hollow pits.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not yet.

               And the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid 
               body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus 
               and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't 
               die.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can do this for five months, 
                         Simon...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE TOWN

               The skies above lighten and smear blue and red.

               KATHERINE

               Finishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and 
               crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Gabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's 
               writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing 
               his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to 
               his.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is getting boring, Simon.

                                     JERRY
                         Amen.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it? Where did you put it?

               The seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's 
               hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it!

               He flings Simon with a horrible crunch against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm just about out of tricks here. 
                         You're a tough one, friend. Old 
                         school.

               He walks over and places a hand with something like friendship 
               on Simon's charred shoulder.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Simon.

               And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's 
               chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth 
               springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart 
               into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body 
               instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor.

               EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING

               Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through 
               town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at 
               the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.

               INT. SCHOOL BUILDING

               Katherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned 
               floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she 
               last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air.

               At a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine 
               approaches.

                                     DEPUTY
                         You may want to skip this, ma'am.

               Katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches 
               down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like 
               a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, 
               smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched 
               deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth.

                                     CROUCHED DEPUTY
                         God damn...

                                     DEPUTY
                              (to Katherine)
                         Were any of your students up here?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine pulls-up and parks.

               INSIDE

               Mary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her 
               grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands 
               beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch 
               that he passes slowly back and forth.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to grandmother)
                         How is she?

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         He found nothing. But something is 
                         in her. I know. Something the 
                         Belagaana doctor can't see. The night 
                         people have been around two days 
                         now. It is a warning.
                              (nods to Navaho man)
                         So we have called the hand trembler. 
                         To find if she must have an Enemy 
                         Ghost Way.

               The old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back 
               and forth across Mary's body.

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty 
               yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare 
               of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels 
               it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine 
               turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of 
               her eye, a glimpse of something very large.

               And winged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert 
               highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one-
               horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car 
               checking a map.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTY BUILDING - DAY

               Small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the 
               front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: 
               SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF.

               INSIDE

               The Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, 
               with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems 
               newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours 
               a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he 
               looks like Barry Goldwater.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And to what do I owe the thrill of a 
                         visit from a So Cal homicide cop?

               He hands the coffee to Thomas, sitting in a chair beside his 
               solid oak desk.

                         A middle-aged secretary enters with 
                         a stack of paper.

               She hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas. 
               He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The 
               secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff.

                         Teacher complained some vagrant was 
                         sleeping in her schoolhouse.

               The Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads 
               further.

                                     SHERIFF

               The Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words 
               like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the 
               name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the

               Thomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land.

               FAR ON THE HORIZON

               A small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the 
               earth. The Town.

               EXT. TOWN HOTEL - DAY

               A former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               Thomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, 
               and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned 
               prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing 
               darkly across its shattered back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General 
               Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the 
               general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently 
               filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands 
               nearby with his shovel.

               INT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE

               Thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, 
               abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding 
               on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches 
               down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam 
               with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at 
               the morgue.

               Far away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's 
               voice.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of 
               the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted 
               by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself 
               into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom 
               door and whoop themselves outside for recess.

               The last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas.

               ACROSS THE STREET

               Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an 
               abandoned house, is Gabriel. He watches Thomas walk to his 
               car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to 
               snort the air, like a coyote.

               INT. THE TOWN LIBRARY

               Thomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. 
               Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost 
               court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A 
               truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly 
               tending his garden in a dying town.

               INT. THE TOWN CHURCH

               Small, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the 
               beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the 
               altar, the crucifix.

               He's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the 
               air.

                                     GABRIEL'S VOICE
                         It's unusual to see someone of your 
                         age in church on a weekday.

               Thomas turns in surprise. Gabriel is kneeling in the row 
               behind, inches from his ear.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't get me wrong. I think it's an 
                         excellent sign of character.

               There's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place 
               in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the 
               back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of 
               the choir box. Jerry waves.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Never mind him. He shouldn't even be 
                         in here. Least not standing.

               Those sunglasses. Impenetrably dark. Like at the skid row 
               flophouse.

               And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone 
               suddenly cold.

               INT. THOMAS'S HOTEL

               There's a note waiting for him at the front desk: "Her name

               Couples drift off the building's porch and into the street 
               to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. John 
               leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper

               street. He passes the bag to Katherine and Thomas.

               Thomas sits in the truck's bed as they Katherine drives 
               through town. John, on the near side of royally toasted, has 
               his boot stuck out the passenger window. Thomas looks up at 
               the night sky. At its blaze of stars.

                         When I was younger I used to believe 
                         that no matter how much you mucked 
                         around in your life, one day, if you 
                         listened hard enough, a voice would 
                         tell you what you were really cut 
                         out to do. And when it didn't show 
                         up on schedule I decided to go look 
                         for it. And I looked in a lot of 
                         places, believe me. I drove that 
                         road out there so far that the end 
                         became the beginning again. And it 
                         was when I got here that I realized 
                         there never was going to be a voice. 
                         So I stopped looking and took the 
                         first job they offered me. That make 
                         any sense to you?

               Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is

               trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, 
               junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end 
               of town.

               Deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, 
               Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his

               As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of 
               her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, 
               talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby.

               Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to 
               put his fingers.

                                     GABRIEL

                         lips... aim it that way, and just 
                         blow a little bit, this is a special 
                         trumpet.

               The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear 
               note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of 
               the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.

                                     GABRIEL

                         have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.

               As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down 
               into it. Looking for something...

               Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg 
               for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second 
               grade friends, and puts her on his knee.

                                     GABRIEL

                         the man?

                         Mary.

                                     SANDRA
                         She isn't here. She's sick.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. 
                         Here, let me see...

               He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her 
               mouth, and gazes in.

               Katherine enters the circle.

                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

               Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL

               Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky 
               red glop that starts running out of his nose.

                         Everyone else does.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I don't know what the hell is going 
                         on, but you both better get out of 
                         here. Right now.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're right...

               He climbs to his feet and stands close to her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...You have no idea what's going on.

               He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls 
               about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he 
               climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine 
               watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school 
               janitor.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Al! Keep an eye on the children for 
                         me. I'll be right back. And call the 
                         sheriff.

                                     JANITOR
                         Sheriff? What the hell do I tell 
                         him?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just call.

               Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.

               EXT. THE TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe 
               of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked 
               near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.

               EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing 
               out of his own car.

                                     KATHERINE

                         I wanted to check on her.

               On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a 
               wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are 
               seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the 
               little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How are you feeling, pumpkin?

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like 
                         to ask you some questions. You don't 
                         have to answer if you don't want to.

                                     MARY
                         It's okay.

               There's a dreamy, far-away look in Mary's eyes. It worries 
               Katherine.

                         I'm good at it. I'm very clever.

                         Simon even said so. He also asked if 
                         I could keep a secret.

                         Something he gave me.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What, pumpkin?

                                     MARY
                         Then it wouldn't be a secret.

                         You're a good friend not to tell,

                         too. So if you ever want to tell, 
                         you can to me. Okay?

                                     MARY
                         It's a secret...

               Mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes.

                                     MARY
                         ...But sometimes it hurts.

               Thomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise 
               again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old 
               voice:

                                     MARY
                         Have you ever killed a chinaman?

                         No Mary, I haven't.

                                     MARY
                         They don't bleed. Not the way you 
                         and I do. Or maybe it was just the 
                         cold...

               Thomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as 
               confused as him.

                                     MARY
                         I've killed them, you know. Lots. 
                         You could always tell when they were 
                         coming. There'd be the trumpets first. 
                         Every note flat. Then those songs... 
                         After that they'd charge. Right down 
                         through the snow. The guns would 
                         freeze and it would be just knives... 
                         It was so cold and there were so 
                         many of them. But I was smarter than 
                         they were. Even at Chosin, I was 
                         smarter...

               Mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind 
               of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a 
               sob.

                                     MARY
                         It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate 
                         it. Please, make it stop!

               She buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing.

                                     MARY
                         Make it stop!

                                     KATHERINE
                              (rocking her)
                         It's okay... It's okay...

               Mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, 
               into the arms of her grandmother.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         It's all right, Miss Henley. We know

               The grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer.

               Katherine turns from trailer and looks at him.

               He pulls over to the side near the copper mine entrance. No

               rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the 
               mine.

               Thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel. It's a black, 
               yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast.

               rock. Here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; 
               dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, 
               piles of support timbers. And all around them the sucking 
               blackness of the earth.

                         It's cold...

               They walk further down into the mine. The atmosphere becomes 
               close and creepy. Thomas has been following tracks left in 
               the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. He stops and sighs.

               -- A BAT suddenly SHRIEKS out of the darkness, glancing off 
               Thomas's shoulder and TANGLING in Katherine's hair. She 
               screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling 
               into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. Thomas 
               rushes over and pulls her out. She climbs shakily to her 
               feet.

                         Yeah... Sorry.

               Thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his 
               flashlight.

                                     DAGGETT

               As he turns to leave the flashlight burns out.

               He bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the 
               first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between 
               the rocks.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What is that?

                         I don't know. Maybe a bum or 
                         something.

               But his gun's out at his side. Just in case. They follow the 
               light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into

               A CAVERN

               -- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's 
               digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of 
               twinkie wrappers,

               And something else.

               From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness 
               that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into 
               the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This 
               is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey 
               on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Do you feel it?

                         ...Yes.

                         What is it?

               But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has 
               disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he 
               leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.

               It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. 
               Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking 
               overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures 
               with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and 
               the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both 
               their minds by the cave.

               Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around 
               him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face 
               as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles 
               about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly 
               black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, 
               eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.

                         Oh no... Oh God no...

               Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. 
               The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity 
               pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the 
               oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to 
               his knees and leans back.

                                     DAGGETT
                         No!

               He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, 
               the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the 
               corner.

               The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking 
               wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm 
               and pull her out of the room.

               EXT. MINE - DAY

               Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel 
               entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair 
               the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, 
               squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.

                                     KATHERINE

                         How? I don't even believe in heaven.

               The tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts 
               at the endless sky above them.

                                     KATHERINE

               Katherine and Thomas open the trailer door and enter

               Thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, 
               parked behind the trailer, Gabriel's rambler. He immediately 
               pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of 
               the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing 
               Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary.

               Jerry suddenly LEAPS out from behind the door and TACKLES 
               Thomas to the carpet. The gun skitters to one side as Jerry 
               SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries 
               out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an 
               ear.

               Gabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as 
               he runs a hand through her hair.

               Katherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the 
               head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up 
               she HITS him again.

               Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard 
               against the chest, forcing him off.

               Gabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING 
               her flat on her back.

               Thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes 
               at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's 
               chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled 
               juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and 
               smiles.

                                     JERRY
                         Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're 
                         a sport.

               Thomas FIRES a slug into his forehead. Jerry's brain winks 
               out as he collapses to the floor, dead.

               Thomas's gun is abruptly WRENCHED from his hand onto the bed 
               as Gabriel NAILS him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed 
               between them, and grabs him by the collar, SLAMMING Thomas 
               up against the wall. He looks down at Jerry's finally lifeless 
               corpse, incensed at Thomas's handiwork.

                                     GABRIEL

                         idea how hard it is to get one of

               He THROWS Thomas down onto a table, SPLINTERING it. Katherine 
               climbs shakily to her knees.

               Gabriel walks over to the bed. The moment he gets close, 
               Mary lifts Thomas's pistol up from the sheets and SHOOTS him 
               twice, the impact KNOCKING him on his ass.

               Katherine rushes to Mary, scoops her up and runs for the 
               door. She pauses beside Thomas, still lying in the wreckage 
               of the table.

               Katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway.

               Gabriel spins around and stands. Thomas leaps from a ragged 
               crouch, HITTING Gabriel low with a body-block.

               It's like butting concrete.

               Gabriel picks up Thomas by the scruff of the neck and HEAVES 
               him THROUGH the flimsy room paneling. Thomas CRASHES with a 
               mass of splinters into the kitchen. He stumbles backward 
               hopelessly as Gabriel peruses him through the trailer. He 
               desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at Gabriel. Finally 
               trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, SCATTERING 
               salt and sugar bowls, and DIVES through the levored window.

               OUTSIDE

               Thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, 
               pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl 
               away as Gabriel BANGS open the trailer door and stomps down 
               the stairs toward Katherine, her arms around Mary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         ...You...

               He eases his gait, measuring the distance to her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         ...Can't...

               There's just those sunglasses coming. Those endless pits of 
               black.

                                     KATHERINE
                         ...Have Her!!

               Katherine lifts Thomas's pistol and FIRES. Again. Again. The 
               slugs BANG off the corregated metal, SMASH a window, KICK up 
               some dust,

               And PUNCTURE the propane tank beneath the trailer.

               -- WUMPP-BAM!

               The entire trailer EXPLODES in a fiery cloud of TWISTING 
               METAL.

               Katherine huddles Mary close to the ground as flaming chunks 
               WHACK everywhere.

               Gabriel is HAMMERED to the earth and disappears in the rolling 
               fire cloud. Thomas, further away, is KNOCKED head-over-heels 
               in the ruddy dust.

               The fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind 
               scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. Gabriel's 
               body looks blackened and still. Katherine rushes to Thomas, 
               who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above 
               his eye bleeding badly. She helps him to his feet and over 
               to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as 
               Katherine pulls out her first aid kit. Mary's there, standing 
               with her shaken grandmother.

                         Is Gabriel dead?

               Mary's knelt down beside Thomas.

                                     MARY
                         They're not like you and me. You've

               A sheriff car ROARS up, the two deputies exiting warily.

                         What the hell happened here?

               Katherine's wiping the blood out of Thomas's eye. Gasping 
               from the shearing pain, he tosses an ID at the foot of the 
               deputy.

                         of it?

               From somewhere back in town there's the growl of a volunteer 
               fire engine.

                         -- Shit...

               The pain's unbareable. Katherine dabs his cut with 
               disinfectant.

                                     DEPUTY

               The volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, 
               drowning out Thomas's words. Two firemen kneel down beside 
               him with medical kits.

               The deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are 
               dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel.

               Thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the 
               firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to 
               desperately grab the one's pant cuff.

                         sunglasses...

               Gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy 
               looks with concern at the firemen.

                                     FIREMAN

                         He'll be all right. Just a bad hit.

               The deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, 
               the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only 
               for Thomas.

                                     FIREMAN

               The patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their 
               engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine.

                         have to do it now.

               They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas 
               up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her 
               grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her 
               as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion 
               as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper 
               mine, it slows down at a junction.

               And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the 
               sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.

               Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads 
               away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.

               The bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He 
               closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before 
               letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing 
               out at the empty tracks of land.

               A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the

               the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. 
               Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another 
               handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.

               There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot 
               from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas 
               crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches

               the first time notices the church it's attached to.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether 
               it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and 
               scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and 
               looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix 
               hanging behind the altar.

                         even control your own killers anymore?

               Thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. When it 
               raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts,

               turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that

               THE VILLAGE

               Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, 
               this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a 
               small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a 
               thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity 
               here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of 
               cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, 
               deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup 
               as Katherine stops.

               The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a 
               black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds 
               in his right hand a small leather case.

               The old man, Bartholomew Grey Horse, walks up to Mary and 
               her grandmother sitting in the bed.

               Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, 
               some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb 
               out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly.

               Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to 
               the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, 
               separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to 
               the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a 
               view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, 
               for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires 
               and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, 
               ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.

                                     MARY
                         This is a good place.

               She's appeared beside him. Thomas crouches down to her level 
               and smiles.

                         Yes?

               Mary's sight is on the view, eyeing it critically.

                                     MARY
                         Separate water source. Stocked grain. 
                         Only one possible approach. A man 
                         could, with the proper defenses, 
                         hold off an entire battalion for 
                         weeks. Months.

               Thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through 
               her hair.

               Mary's eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and 
               leads her back to the adobe hogans.

               Grey Horse, the yataalii, is there now.

               Night creeps over the Chuska Mountains across the crusty 
               caliche flats and over the village, pushing back the dying 
               day to a thin, fading blue line etched across the horizon. 
               As the darkness settles on the hogans we see a glimmer of 
               light from within and the rising, guttural chants of the 
               yataalii.

               INT. KIVA - NIGHT

               Under the village, beneath the surface of the butte, is the 
               large communal kiva room. Accessible by a single ladder 
               through a single smoke hole, it is down here that the village 
               performs its Enemy Ghost Way for Mary.

               The little girl is there, attended by her grandmother, sitting 
               stoically still on a blanket as Grey Horse, grasping his 
               painted prayer sticks, by the glow of a fire chants the Enemy 
               Ghost Way cure. Katherine's eyes sting in the smokey air as 
               she watches Grey Horse take from his case small handfulls of 
               colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor.

               The whole Bitter Sky Clan surrounds them. Old, lined faces. 
               A small, dying people here to support its last granddaughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Katherine stands there in the chilly darkness outside the 
               kiva. Mary's grandmother, passing with some other women, 
               pauses and squeezes Katherine's arm.

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         Now we sleep, Katherine. Tomorrow, 
                         after dark, we begin again.

               INSIDE THE KIVA

               The fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now 
               empty room.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up 
               her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing 
               beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind. 
               It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.

                                     VOICE
                         Hello, Katherine.

               Like the wind, it is low and thin and hoarse. Like the wind 
               it seems to come from everywhere. And, like the wind, it is 
               utterly without pity or remorse.

               Katherine turns.

               Perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure 
               clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are 
               hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head, 
               but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. There are endless 
               scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are 
               the eyes.

               Katherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria 
               rising in her throat.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Oh Lord, I can't do this. I can't do 
                         this anymore...

                         We must talk, Katherine.

               It's takes all her strength to look upon him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're... You're...

                         ...God?

                                     FIGURE
                         God is love, Katherine.

               The eyes narrow. Rippling pools of unfathomable evil.

                                     FIGURE
                         -- I don't love you.

               There's a crouched silhouette beside the figure. Dimmer. 
               Skinny. A wheezing sycophant. An afterthought.

               Katherine backs away from both of them.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go 
                         away.

                         I can kill you, Katherine. I can lay 
                         you out and fill your mouth with 
                         your mother's feces. Or I can talk 
                         with you.

               Katherine stops. Faces him.

                                     FIGURE
                         I am here, before you, in a form to

                         Good job.

               The sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under 
               its cloak.

                                     FIGURE
                         I rarely do this in person. I am, 
                         perhaps, somewhat out of touch.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you one of them?

                         You're not an angel?

                                     FIGURE
                         Oh, I am an angel. A very special 
                         one. The first. The oldest. The naive 
                         eagle scout, he once loved me above 
                         all others, and I him. It was the 
                         only true love for either of us, but 
                         like all true love, it couldn't 
                         possibly last.

               The figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them. 
               The movement makes a liquid, snapping sound.

                                     FIGURE
                         The winged party boys will come, 
                         Katherine. They'll come to feed on 
                         the guts of your little Mary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What do you care?

                         I have my interests...

               He turns back to her.

                                     FIGURE
                         The naive eagle scout, he has his 
                         interests too. He even has a place 
                         for them, as I do for mine. Big, 
                         shiny place. You'd like it. Only 
                         it's been empty for a long time. 
                         Can't open till after the 
                         resurrection. The problem's with the 
                         hired help. Always had problems with 
                         the hired help. They're arrogant, 
                         boastful little pricks. Not like me. 
                         What I did I did for love. But they, 
                         the winged party boys, even before 
                         the park could open for its first 
                         customer, they started fighting over 
                         the popcorn stand.

               The figure shifts his perch on the wall.

                                     FIGURE
                         You see, Katherine, heaven can't 
                         start accepting guests till this 
                         fight is settled. And without people, 
                         there is no heaven. All those good 
                         and true souls left mouldering in 
                         the ground clutching their H-tickets 
                         and waiting and waiting and waiting... 
                         Some, lying down there with the worms 
                         century after century, they start to 
                         get doubts about the whole program. 
                         That's when, out of sheer boredom, 
                         some of them come to me. Because I'm 
                         always open for business. 24 hours a 
                         day, seven days a week. Even on 
                         Christmas.

               The figure's face darkens.

                                     FIGURE
                         Some of the angels cheat. They sneak

                         The really dark ones. And now one of 
                         them has found a special soul so 
                         wonderfully sick that it might just 
                         win it for them. And if one side 
                         wins, even the wrong one, then there's

                         I want this war to go on and on and 
                         on.

               The figure straightens up, stretching its spine.

               Thomas's sitting on the hard-packed floor, leaning against 
               the adobe wall, maybe trying to sleep. Mostly trying to ignore 
               the thumping pain in his head. The oil lamp's flame shudders 
               in the gust of Katherine opening the door.

                         The other night, you were talking 
                         about waiting for a voice to call 
                         you to something. Well, let me tell 
                         you, the worst thing that can happen 
                         to you is to be called to something. 
                         Since I can remember a voice from 
                         somewhere deep in the Church called 
                         me. So loud and so often that by 
                         thirteen I knew I was going to be a 
                         priest. You know what that's like? 
                         My parents, friends, all of them 
                         thought I was crazy. But see, I had 
                         this voice. The voice that kept 
                         coaxing me along, telling me there 
                         was a reason. So I entered the 
                         seminary and was half way to my 
                         starched white collar when my mother, 
                         father, and my little brother were 
                         wiped out in a car crash.

               He pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.

                         I had never asked anything of the 
                         voice. Not when the neighborhood 
                         kids made fun of me, not when my 
                         father looked down at me like some 
                         knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned 
                         a damn thing. But on the morning I 
                         spent looking down at three parallel 
                         graves, I asked it one question. 
                         Why. Why were these people taken 
                         from me? And the voice, that same 
                         voice that would wrench me out of my 
                         sleep some nights with its jabbering, 
                         it was suddenly stone silent. It was 
                         the only question I ever asked of it 
                         and it just left me hanging in the 
                         fucking wind...

               He blinks back the tears welling in his eye.

               The oil lamp wanes and fades. Katherine lays her head on 
               Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds 
               her. They hold each other.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               John the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. 
               The night breeze through the window, and maybe something 
               else, tickles his nose. His eyes open, blink, turn left, 
               right, then up,

               -- And see Gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at 
               him.

                         Heavy sleeper, John.

               John's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened 
               and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. 
               John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down 
               with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and 
               beside John.

                                     JOHN

                         You ought to have that nose looked 
                         at, man.

               Gabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers,

                                     JOHN
                         No, really. I don't know. The school 
                         maybe.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now you're not even trying, John. 
                         You're Katherine's best friend. She 
                         tells you everything.

                         I'm just the driver, y'know?

               Gabriel extends a blistered, open palm over John's face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can help you remember, John...

               FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

               We see Gabriel leaning over John as a sickly yellow glow 
               begins to rise and reflect off the walls. Beneath it comes 
               John's worst and deepest screams...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Gabriel SPLASHING the soot off his face and arms in a small, 
               institutional bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into

               A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

               At the end of it is the intensive care unit, that 
               institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, 
               wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between 
               life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health 
               status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from 
               her work at Gabriel.

                                     NURSE
                         Can I help you?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Someone's going to die here soon. 
                         I'll just be a minute.

                                     NURSE
                         There's no visitors allowed in ICU.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The timing's important. I can smell 
                         these things, you know.

               The nurse reaches for the telephone. Gabriel takes it away 
               from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face 
               open-palmed and whispers,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Go to sleep.

               The nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. 
               Gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's 
               chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside 
               as unsuitable.

                                     GABRIEL

                              one)
                         Deteriorating critical.

               Satisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the 
               curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle-aged 
               woman. He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of 
               the EKG above her.

               It was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, 
               becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm 
               has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. 
               At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across 
               her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. 
                         That's it...

               The EKG's still flat but the woman is breathing. She begins 
               to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. 
               She looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on 
               Gabriel's grin.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi.

               A look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as 
               she begins to cry.

                         It's only for a short time.
                              (grins)
                         Promise.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sun cresting the Lukachukais and warming with honey 
               colored reflection the interior of the hogan.

               Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of 
               them asleep sitting against the wall.

               Katherine opens her eyes and rises stiffly. She looks out 
               the simple window to the glow of morning without expression, 
               turns, and walks out.

               IN THE OTHER HOGAN

               Mary's Grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers 
               are attending Mary as Katherine enters. Mary is sitting up 
               in her bed. She smiles at Katherine.

                                     MARY
                         Hi, Miss Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Hi, pumpkin. Good morning.

               Grey Horse is kneeling near the bed preparing a bowl drink. 
               Into it he crushes charcoal, dodge weed, juniper and ghost 
               plant. This he stirs, heats over flame, and feeds to Mary. 
               She grimaces and leans back in the bed as Grey Horse says a 
               brief prayer.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine runs into Thomas outside the hogan.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How's the head?

                         Shitty. Coffee?

               She accepts a mug, blowing a cloud of steam off the top.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What are we going to do if he comes?

                         When he comes.

                              him)

                         Mary's ceremony isn't over yet. The 
                         Enemy Ghost Way. The alien spirit

                         Would you have believed in any of 
                         this three days ago?

                         You have the gun?

                         -- And a change of clothing, are all 
                         still at the hotel.
                              (sighs)
                         We're going to have to come up with 
                         something.

                                     KATHERINE
                         We could always ask him.

               Thomas looks up. She's referring to Lucifer, who's appeared 
               perched on the edge of the low, eye-level hogan roof. The 
               sycophant is also nearby, chattering its teeth and staring 
               at Katherine with jealous, rabid eyes.

               Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I always forget how cold it gets in 
                         the desert.

               The swimming, bottomless eyes fall on Thomas.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Mr. Daggett, I presume. How's the 
                         faith?

               Thomas can't bring himself to say anything. To form the words.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Come come, must you be so wishy-washy 
                         about everything? With the absent-
                         minded eagle scout, I can see that. 
                         But you're looking at the devil man, 
                         say something.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Fuck you.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Much better. Can I have some coffee?

               Thomas gingerly hands him the cup. The angel Lucifer lifts 
               it, and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his 
               mouth, drinks. He offers the mug back to Thomas for a sip.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Keep it.

               He finishes it. Cranes his neck.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I have come to remind you that the 
                         winged party boys are just that: 
                         spoiled boys. You are armed, however 
                         pathetically, with the one thing 
                         they never really understood: 
                         theology. It's not much, but that's 
                         life.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Is this supposed to be our "win one 
                         for The Ripper" speech?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett.

               And you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that 
               those eyes mean it.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Go and get ready, Thomas.

               Thomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. In 
               an instant Lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to 
               Katherine's side. Face and eyes and maggot breath 
               uncomfortably close, he smiles.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Have you ever considered Katherine, 
                         that the great absentee landlord, 
                         the soft-eyed eagle scout your 
                         childhood prayers are for, is just 
                         using you? That you're only the 
                         exterminator to get rid of his pests?

               Lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads 
               her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. 
               His mouth presses against her ear and whispers,

                                     LUCIFER
                         God's junkies are coming, Katherine. 
                         And when they do, all hell is going 
                         to break loose...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A tiny speck on the empty horizon. It grows, takes shape, 
               and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it WOOSHES 
               past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway.

               Gabriel's at the wheel. Beside him, grey-blonde hair streaming 
               out behind her, is Rachael, recently lifted from the file-
               and-forget section of the hospital ICU. She tilts her head 
               up. Lets the sun warm her pallor. Just a sociopathic angel 
               and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top-down cruise 
               across a sixty million year old desert.

               It could happen.

               INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

               A reality bruised waitress, Madge, sets down a coffee and 
               milkshake before Gabriel. He downs the shake in one belt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Say, Ma'am, any idea where I can 
                         find Old Woman Butte?

                                     MADGE
                         It's on the reservation.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I don't suppose you could be just a 
                         tad more specific. Madge.

               The waitress' eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and 
               burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside 
               in the rambler.

                                     MADGE
                         Isn't your friend hungry?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest 
                         thing.

               Madge has a lot of things she misses in her life, but one of 
               them she decides isn't Gabriel.

                                     MADGE
                         Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut-
                         off. First dirt road go left. Twenty, 
                         twenty-five miles you'll see it. 
                         Big, black and all alone.

               Gabriel downs the coffee, stands, and tosses a bill on the 
               counter.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I doubt we'll meet again.

                                     MADGE
                         Suits me.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Thomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins 
               fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby 
               rooftop.

                                     DAGGETT
                         You could always lend a hand.

               Lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that 
               hideous mouth.

               INSIDE THE KIVA

               Grey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary 
               is prepared with paint and oils.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the 
               horizon.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls 
               unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have 
               been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants 
               of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.

               Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into 
               shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears 
               a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it 
               can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         He's coming.

               Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one 
               of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Is there any way to speed this up?

                                     VILLAGER
                         No.

               A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking 
               smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants 
               to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing 
               sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in 
               guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out 
               of the child.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Lock the door.

               He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Stay inside. It's only one round, so 
                         make it count.

               There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches 
               his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the 
               kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks 
               out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.

               EXT. GABRIEL'S RAMBLER - DAY

               Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel 
               roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the 
               butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving 
               the land a deathly bluish grey.

               The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel 
               can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the 
               rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the 
               blonde on the knee.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You'll like this, Rachael.

               Maybe not.

               There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas 
               at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it 
               over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the 
               brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car 
               STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield 
               into the dust.

               Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron 
               bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he 
               cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (breathless)
                         Nice move.

               Thomas's feet crunch softly closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You ought to come work for us. 
                         Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian 
                         in now and then, you know. You'd 
                         like it. Nobody tells you when to go 
                         to bed, can eat all the ice cream 
                         you want. And you get to kill. All 
                         day and all night. Just like an angel.

               Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he 
               carefully steps closer and closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Save yourself, friend. Why go to the 
                         wall with the bitch and her rug rat? 
                         It'll all turn out the same anyway. 
                         Here or in heaven, we're still gonna 
                         tear the kid apart.

                         I'm not an angel, heaven or hell. 
                         I'm a man you eyeless puke, which 
                         means I have one thing you never 
                         will. A soul. And though I may, 
                         somewhere inside, believe in a God, 
                         I will never, never, believe in you.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A little speechy today, aren't we?
                              (sighs)
                         Okay pal, have it your way.

               Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas, 
               sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying 
               as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but 
               Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. 
               Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is going to really, really hurt.

               Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.

               Gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.

                         the son of God or if he is God.

                         theology before I picked up a gun.

                         God. Prove it!

               Gabriel hesitates.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I don't have to.

                         just a son!

                              (hisses)
                         Shut up...

               Gabriel's becoming unglued.

                                     DAGGETT
                         If you wanted to know so badly, 
                         Gabriel, why didn't you just ask 
                         Him? Why didn't you just ask God?

               A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks 
               down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!

               The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself, 
               suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness. 
               For the village.

               Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --

               -- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her 
               legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails 
               DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. 
               The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face 
               taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.

               Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs 
               off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, 
               BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his 
               knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee 
               out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the 
               way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is 
               white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls 
               on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from 
               shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like 
               ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into 
               his scalp.

               It's about all one human can take.

               Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to 
               climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. 
               Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short 
               stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over 
               the wall --

               And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.

               Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, 
               shuddering breaths.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS 
               down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second 
               and KICKS its door down. Nothing.

               IN THE KIVA

               Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned 
               the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the 
               relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost 
               Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire 
               we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.

               IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE

               Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every 
               few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's 
               hopeless though. We know it.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. 
               There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be 
               heard the muffled sound of chanting.

               THOMAS

               Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches 
               out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.

               GABRIEL

               Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles 
               but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight 
               into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.

               INSIDE

               Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears 
               in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Relax folks, it's just a soul.

               From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, 
               into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the 
               kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to 
               Katherine.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm getting real tired of you.

               She stands her ground between him and the child.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go to hell.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least 
                         get the zip code right.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's all the same, isn't it?

                                     GABRIEL
                         No. In heaven we believe in love.

                                     KATHERINE
                         And what do you love, Gabriel?

               Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly 
               pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Cracking your skull.

               He advances on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         That's all it is for you anymore, 
                         Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing 
                         and the burning. You don't work for 
                         God anymore. You don't fight for 
                         love.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shut up!

               And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to 
               her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, 
               clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a 
               silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, 
               flows through her body.

               From somewhere outside, there's a sound.

               Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to 
               smolder around her.

               We hear the sound once more, closer, before --

               The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup 
               CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into 
               Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a 
               broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets 
               up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic 
               Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with 
               him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire 
               iron.

               Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his 
               knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare 
               out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, 
               one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor 
               toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Mary!

               Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all 
               her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, 
               her eyes wild.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it.

               He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it!

               Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice 
               faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked 
               pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.

               Katherine turns back to Gabriel.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go home.

               She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high 
               once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode 
               his skull.

               When a hand stops her.

               Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, 
               holding the raised bar still.

                                     LUCIFER
                         No.

               Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. 
               Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as 
               they awkwardly try to finish the chant.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Please. Go on.

               Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans 
               at the sight of him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Oh man, this just isn't my day.

               Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts 
               to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, 
               chattering warning at her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Long time.

                         The world's young, man.

                                     LUCIFER
                         And full of ambition.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This isn't your war.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But I remember the last one. Michael's 
                         war.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You lost.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But lots of angels were with me. 
                         every one followed their leader out 
                         of heaven.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Except one. Oh, he was with me all 
                         right. He hated the Eagle Scout. 
                         Envied the power He gave to His Son. 
                         But this angel never came out front 
                         during the war. And when it ended he 
                         thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout 
                         didn't notice. So he laid low and 
                         towed the company line till he could 
                         start his own war. It was all just 
                         jealousy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're dreaming.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's 
                         why I'm here.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Stay away from me.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You've always been a part of me, 
                         Gabriel. And now it's time to come 
                         home.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fuck you!

               Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. 
               As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into 
               Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm 
               half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon 
               Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical 
               laughter.

               The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting 
               Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter 
               as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of 
               orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the 
               angel's heart,

               And eats it.

               At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead, 
               speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.

               Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A 
               battered, hollow shell.

               Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns 
               to Katherine.

                                     GREY HORSE
                         The enemy spirit is gone.

                              (weak, faint)
                         Where?

               From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, 
               savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a 
               lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. 
               Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes 
               for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. 
               Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.

               She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to 
               death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt 
               out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced 
               arm.

                                     KATHERINE
                         And they won't find it. Not in Mary.

               A few of the village elders appear at the cab.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Can you help him?

                                     VILLAGER
                         We have some bandages.

               Katherine walks over to where Mary, sweaty and shaken, sits 
               huddled in a corner attended by Grey Horse.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you all right, pumpkin?

               Mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.

                                     MARY
                         I'm okay.

               Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's going to be okay... We're all 
                         going to be okay...

               The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by 
               the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer 
               has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, 
               yellow eyes on Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I can't quite bring myself to say 
                         thank you.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I understand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Then this is done.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. 
                         Maybe I want you to come with me.

               He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You owe me, Katherine. And you're 
                         going to ask me to take you home.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (clutching Mary)
                         No.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You will. You will because any other 
                         way is going to be more awful than 
                         you can imagine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you threatening me?

               Just a grinning, twisted stare.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Then you've picked the wrong person 
                         this time. I've just about had it up 
                         to here with ghosts. So you can put 
                         away the horror movie sneer and the 
                         K-Mart halloween eyes, because we 
                         know you now. We know you all. And 
                         if you want to force the issue then 
                         go ahead because you're just another 
                         angel to me. Take a look at your 
                         buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do 
                         you really, really want to fuck with 
                         us?

               The smallest hint of a pause.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Perhaps another time.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'm holding my breath.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Goodbye, Katherine. For now.

               And he's gone. Through the door and into the night.

                                     MARY
                         Is he coming back?

                                     KATHERINE
                         I don't think so, honey... I don't 
                         think so...

               The fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright. 
               Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing

               The village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos 
               from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff 
               department sedans.

               The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas 
               is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds 
               properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside 
               him chewing on a wild oat stalk.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You'll be going back to Los Angeles 
                         now?

                         Yeah.

               The Sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside 
               the oak stalk.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Don't hurry back.

               The deputy finishes his bandaging.

                         Don't do much but breathe the next 
                         few days. And get to a hospital. 
                         You're going to need some serious 
                         stitches.

                         Say hi to Hollywood for me.

               He follows his boss. Katherine and Mary walk up.

                                     MARY
                         You look bad.

                         Not really. I think they might have 
                         even understood. One of them's related 
                         to this clan. He'll give us a ride 
                         back if we want.

                         hospitality with the sheriff's 
                         department.

               The moment drifts into silence.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Do you think it's really over?

                         When I die, I want you with me.

                         I want that too.

               She touches his cheek, Mary cradled between them.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Thomas sitting in the back of the tribal police bronco,

               To the end of the earth.

               As the bronco drifts away from us toward the empty, rocky 
               horizon, as it slowly blends and is consumed by the land,

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Did you hear that?

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          The innkeeper told me --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FAT KNIGHT
          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          What the devil are you --?!

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

                         FRANCE

                         1324

          5.

                         CONTINUED:
          There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is
          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-
          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

                         LUCIE
          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

                         ISABELLE
          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

                         SUZETTE
          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even
          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark
          contrast to her squalid surroundings.
          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

                         CARPENTER
          Hey, there! Let one of these
          young lads get that for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I can do it myself.
          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.

          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY

          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

                         CESAIRE
          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

                         PETER
          I'm taking a break.

                         WOODCUTTER BOSS
          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY

          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,
          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes
          her in his arms, kissing her. She holds him tight.

                         PETER
          I was afraid you weren't coming.

                         ISABELLE
          You should know better than that.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CONTINUED:
          He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
          her eyes, smiles up at him. Touches his face.

                         ISABELLE
          I think my sister's starting to
          suspect something.

                         PETER
          Do you think she'll tell your
          father?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to
          know. Besides, my father likes
          you.

                         PETER
          Of course he does. Right up until
          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

                         ISABELLE
          What's going on?

                         PETER
          You haven't heard?
          (off her look)
          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Was it the Wolf?

                         PETER
          Could it have been anything else?
          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

                         PETER
          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

                         ISABELLE
          I know. You say that every month.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her. She kisses
          him back, then tries to stop kissing him. It's not easy.

                         ISABELLE
          I'd better go.

                         PETER
          Same time tomorrow?

                         ISABELLE
          Don't get used to this. I start
          my sewing lessons next week.

                         PETER
          You really think you can go all
          day without seeing me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'll manage somehow. Pride is a
          cardinal sin, by the way.

                         PETER
          I can think of worse sins I could
          be committing.
          She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile.

          The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon
          sign. He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon
          with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent.

          Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket.
          Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your grandmother,
          understand? You're her student
          now, the same as the other girls.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Mother.
          Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.

                         SUZETTE
          My last baby has grown up.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING

          Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
          hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She
          applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes
          it 'disappear,' then smiles big and runs away.
          A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look.

                         LUCRECE
          You're only encouraging him.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.
          THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced,
          cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical,
          serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious).
          A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look
          tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.

                         ISABELLE
          You look happy.

                         ROXANNE
          Aren't you excited?

                         PRUDENCE
          It's too early to be excited.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm just trying to look on the
          bright side.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Well, stop it before somebody
          hurts you.
          The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

          The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through
          the dark forest. The puppy stops at the edge of the
          forest. Then it WHINES and refuses to follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING

          The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as
          they can see. Rosemaria walks with Roxanne. Prudence
          hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip.

                         PRUDENCE
          Did you hear about her and the
          Darley brothers?

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, no! Which one?

                         PRUDENCE
          Both! On the same night!
          Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
          contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at
          them. She scowls at Isabelle.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why does your grandmother have to
          live so far away?

                         ISABELLE
          What's the matter, Rosemaria?
          Having trouble walking?
          Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving.
          Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a
          BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage,
          well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it.
          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
          with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, stop dawdling. Come on,
          come on.
          The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your mother has warned you not to
          expect any special treatment from
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, ma'am.
          Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a
          smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple.

          Well, then your mother doesn't
          know me very well, does she?
          Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles, casting
          loops of red wool yarn onto one of them, a BLACK CAT
          resting on her lap. Her bedchamber is hidden by a
          beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates.
          The girls sit facing her, watching as she knits. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There. This is going to be my
          foundation. Everything I do now
          will build off of this.
          She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Roxanne, is this a good
          foundation?

                         ROXANNE
          I don't know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why not?

                         ROXANNE
          Well... you haven't told us what
          you're making.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There's something else I haven't
          told you. I haven't told you why
          I'm making it. Before you begin
          any task, you must first always
          ask yourself why.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why?
          The girls laugh. Grandmother gives her a patient smile.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because understanding why you are
          doing something is the key to
          doing it successfully. So, before
          we begin today, let's be certain
          that we have a good foundation.
          Who can tell me why you are here?

          how to sew and mend clothes.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That's what you are doing. But
          why are you doing it?
          Blank looks. None of them have ever considered this.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Isabelle, your sister studied with
          me last winter. What does she do
          now?

                         ISABELLE
          She works with the women.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why don't you work with them?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know how to yet.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And how does that make you feel?
          Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight.

                         ISABELLE
          Like a child.
          Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be coming here every day
          for the next three months. During
          that time, I will teach you
          everything you need to know to be
          productive members of our
          community. But there is something
          far more important that will also
          be happening here.
          All the girls are paying close attention now, but
          Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be proving your worth and
          learning your place in the world.
          And I promise you, when you leave
          here for the last time, you will
          never feel like a child again.

          The four girls return to the village along the forest
          path. Waiting for them is Peter. Isabelle pretends to
          not notice him. As they pass, he calls out to her:

                         PETER
          I need to talk to you.
          Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.

                         ISABELLE
          What about?
          Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
          sees that the other girls have stopped to watch.
          Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and
          leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          When were you planning on telling
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Telling you what?

                         PETER
          That you're engaged to be married
          to Henri Smith.
          Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          Henri Smith? Is this a joke?

                         PETER
          Look at me. Just look at me and
          tell me you didn't know.
          She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.

                         ISABELLE
          Who told you this?

                         PETER
          Your father.
          Off Isabelle's look...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is gathered around the table. Isabelle and

          It's all been arranged. Your
          marriage to Henri will settle our
          debt to his father.
          Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.

                         SUZETTE
          We know that you and Peter have
          become friends. But you have
          adult responsibilities now. That
          means putting your family's
          interests ahead of your own.

                         ISABELLE
          So Henri Smith is in the family's
          interest and Peter is not?

                         CESAIRE
          Peter is a fine young man.

                         ISABELLE
          But what? He's poor? He's an
          orphan?

                         SUZETTE
          He's not one of us. His parents
          were outsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          Why? Because they hadn't lived
          here since Noah built the ark?

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your tongue.
          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.

                         LUCIE
          Do you realize how this makes me
          look? I'm older than her by more
          than a year. If anyone should be
          getting married in the spring,
          it's me.
          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the
          cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled. Suzette sits nearby.

          15.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          This was your idea. Now I have
          both of them hating me.
          In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but
          Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop.

                         SUZETTE
          We knew Isabelle was going to be
          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her
          to simply do as she's told. She's
          too much like her grandmother.

                         CESAIRE
          That she is. What about Lucie?

                         SUZETTE
          She's a good girl, but she's still
          a child. Talk to her. You're her
          father. She'll listen to you.
          Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's
          been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle gives her a sad look.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

                         HENRI
          Hello, Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Hello, Henri.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence. Then:

                         HENRI
          So I suppose you've heard.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. My parents are very pleased.

                         HENRI
          And you? Are you pleased?

                         ISABELLE
          It's a very generous arrangement.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not the answer he was hoping for. Another awkward beat.

                         HENRI
          Do you have any other feelings
          about it? About me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm not sure. We've never really
          talked that much.

                         HENRI
          I know. That's why I asked you to
          walk with me. I wanted to talk.

                         ISABELLE
          What for?

                         HENRI
          Well... because we're going to be
          husband and wife soon.

                         ISABELLE
          Not until the spring festival.
          That's months away. A lot can
          happen in a few months.
          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          All right. What would you like to
          talk about?

                         HENRI
          I'm not really sure. I brought
          you this.
          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

                         ISABELLE
          Well, I'm glad we had this
          conversation.
          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes
          averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's
          purposefully ignoring her mother. Suzette notices.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         SUZETTE
          You know, I had a sweetheart when
          I was your age, too.
          Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself.
          Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction.

                         ISABELLE
          What happened?

                         SUZETTE
          Nothing happened. My parents
          arranged for me to marry your
          father and that was the end of
          that.

                         ISABELLE
          Didn't you want to marry your
          sweetheart?

                         SUZETTE
          Of course, I did. But there's
          more to marriage than being in
          love. Love doesn't always last
          and it certainly doesn't fill your
          children's bellies in the winter.

                         ISABELLE
          You've never wished you could have
          married that other boy?

                         SUZETTE
          Not even once.
          Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles
          on it. Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them.

                         PETER
          We need to talk.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church, out of sight.
          Peter looks off toward the woods, his back to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          You have to go through with it.
          You have to marry Henri.

          18.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle takes a step toward him. She hesitates,
          gathering her nerve to speak. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care what my parents want.
          They don't own me. I love you.

                         PETER
          That doesn't matter.

                         ISABELLE
          It does to me. Doesn't it matter
          to you?

                         PETER
          It's not our decision to make.

                         ISABELLE
          You sound like my mother.

                         PETER
          Then maybe you should start
          listening to your mother.
          (off her look)
          It's over. They had to find out
          eventually. Don't turn this into
          something that it's not. We had
          our fun, but that's all it ever
          was.
          Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you.

                         PETER
          Go home, Isabelle. Go home and
          grow up.
          Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you!
          He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream. The sun is just barely
          rising, rays of light shining through the trees. He
          smiles. It looks like the start of a beautiful day.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The village is bustling with activity, but there's a
          palpable tension. The picture on the moon sign is of a
          three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to
          a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING

          Isabelle emerges from the cottage. Roxanne, Prudence,
          and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her. They all start
          toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something...
          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.
          Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.
          Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls
          follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING

          The girls walk through the village. Isabelle is lost in
          thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal.

                         ROXANNE
          What's wrong with Lucie?

                         ROSEMARIA
          How would you feel if you were in
          love with your sister's fiancÃ©e?
          Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie is not in love with my
          fiancÃ©e.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Really? So she's just had a crush
          on him since she was ten?

                         ISABELLE
          As if she would really tell you
          something like that.

                         ROSEMARIA
          She didn't. She told my sister.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Did you honestly not know?
          Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just
          then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri
          works with his father, ADRIEN. Henri smiles at Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on. We're going to be late.
          She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's
          cottage. Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy.
          There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A
          SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest, overgrown and
          narrow. Rosemaria looks at it for a beat...
          Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them.
          She looks back and sees her start down the other path.

                         ROXANNE
          Rosemaria...?
          The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed
          to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path.

                         ISABELLE
          What are you doing?

                         ROSEMARIA
          What does it look like?

                         ISABELLE
          You can't go that way. You have
          to stay on the path.

                         ROSEMARIA
          This way is faster.

                         PRUDENCE
          But it's not safe. My brother
          says the bridge is rotten.

                         ROSEMARIA
          I don't care. It's bad enough
          working all day in that smelly
          cottage. It's not reasonable for
          them to expect us to walk that far
          every day on top of that.
          She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then:

                         PRUDENCE
          If you get lost, nobody will come
          looking for you. Not tonight.
          This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the
          narrow path. It suddenly seems a little ominous.
          Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls
          exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on.
          The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects.
          Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone finish what you're
          working on. Your parents will be
          worried if you're not home before
          it starts to get dark.
          The girls begin packing up their work. Prudence sighs.

                         PRUDENCE
          I wish someone would just kill
          that stupid wolf.

                         ROXANNE
          You can't just kill it. It's not
          an ordinary wolf. It's a devil-
          wolf. A servant of Satan himself.
          Prudence rolls her eyes. Whatever.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Who cares what it is? It's only
          one night a month. You stay
          inside, lock up the animals, and
          you don't go into the forest.
          It's never killed anyone from the
          village and as long as we leave it
          alone, it never will.

          22.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          My goodness. I had no idea our
          young people were so woefully
          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the
          Bold even visited here once. But
          that, of course, was before the
          Wolf came.
          The girls listen attentively.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents fear the Wolf because
          they remember when it did kill
          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began
          to spread that we were cursed.
          That was when our village began to
          die. And that was why my husband
          led a group of men into the woods
          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.
          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          After that, people here didn't
          have much stomach to go hunting
          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us
          alone ever since.

                         ISABELLE
          People still die.

          Yes, but nobody we know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone knows what should be
          done. But it's not always easy to
          do what you know is right.
          Sometimes it's easier to settle
          for being safe.
          Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

                         ISABELLE
          You were right. About Peter. I
          was being childish.

                         (BEAT)
          But I'm not going to marry Henri.
          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

                         SUZETTE
          You'll do as you're told. It's
          all been arranged.

                         ISABELLE
          The family gains the same no
          matter which one of us marries
          him. And I don't love Henri.
          Lucie does.
          Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.

                         ISABELLE
          She's right. It's not fair. I
          will gladly trade places with her.
          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

                         LUCIE
          Shut up.
          Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face.

          24.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry... I...

                         LUCIE
          Please. Just shut up and mind
          your own business.
          A tense beat. Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT

          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

                         BOY
          I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat
          you up!

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What on earth --?
          The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the
          look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne,
          Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has
          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It's my little secret. A pinch
          will help you rest. A little more
          and you'll sleep through the end
          of the world.
          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

                         ISABELLE
          I think I'd like that.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Two men, the Merchant and the REEVE, gossip by the well.

                         MERCHANT
          She had it coming, if you ask me.
          What the hell was she doing out
          there?
          Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,
          drawing a water from the well. Both men shift
          uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as
          Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body. Suddenly,
          Grandmother stops. She's found something clutched in
          Lucie's hand. A troubled look comes over her...

                         ISABELLE
          What is it?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Nothing.
          Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Lucie's funeral. Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle,
          who holds Grandmother's hand. The other girls are here,
          too. Roxanne sits with her mother, MARGUERITE, and
          Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The
          priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Wherefore each man and woman that
          is wise, make him ready thereto;
          for we all shall die, and we know
          not how soon...

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the
          cemetery. Father Auguste frowns, disapproving.
          Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside.

                         MARGUERITE
          Take your brother home.
          Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
          away, but he fights her, crying and kicking.
          Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien.

                         ADRIEN
          She was a good girl. We all loved
          her.
          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

                         HENRI
          I'm here for you, too.
          But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          ATTEWATER, the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of
          the Villagers. Isabelle, Suzette, and Grandmother sit
          with Cesaire, who is angrily addressing the crowded room.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          A line has been crossed. The
          beast must be destroyed!

                         MERCHANT
          Your daughter crossed the line.
          She went into the woods.

                         CESAIRE
          She was taken. She must have
          been!

                         MERCHANT
          So the Wolf broke into your home
          and stole your daughter without
          waking anyone or leaving any sign
          at all?

                         REEVE
          It's been almost thirty years
          since someone here was killed by
          the Wolf. We've left it alone.
          Why would it suddenly come and
          take one of us now?
          Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I know something.
          Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks.
          She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded
          up washcloth we saw her with earlier.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I found this. I believe it must
          belong to her attacker.
          Attewater unfolds the washcloth. There are a few strands
          of hair inside. He gives her a sharp look.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is not animal hair.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          No, it isn't. It's human.
          A stunned silence comes over the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          No man could have done the things
          that were done to your
          granddaughter. It must have been
          the Wolf.

          Yet she was holding a man's hair
          in her hand when she died.

                         ATTEWATER
          What are you suggesting?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That the man and the Wolf may be
          one and the same.
          A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd.

                         ATTEWATER
          A werewolf.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          It would explain much. The Pope
          himself has declared that such
          creatures exist.
          The thought gives everyone pause.

                         MERCHANT
          Even if you're right, it doesn't
          help us. The woods are filled
          with hermits and strangers. If
          there's a werewolf among them, how
          will we find it?

                         ATTEWATER
          There are experts in these
          matters. Men who find and try
          witches and werewolves. We could
          request the Church to send
          someone.
          Grandmother gives him a sharp look.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not someone. You're talking about
          Father Solomon.
          This sends a ripple of comment through the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          He is the Church's most successful
          werewolf hunter.

                         ADRIEN
          But what of his methods? The man
          once burned down an entire village
          just to root out one witch.

                         ATTEWATER
          Unsubstantiated rumors. The
          Church has appointed him the
          Witchfinder General of all
          Christendom.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          That is also unsubstantiated.
          Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground.

                         ATTEWATER
          I have the utmost confidence in
          the ability of the Witchfinder
          General to determine the nature of
          the beast and put an end to it. I
          will dispatch a messenger in the
          morning.

                         CESAIRE
          Even if Father Solomon agrees to
          help us, it will take weeks for
          him to get here. That means
          another full moon. Maybe two.
          We must defend ourselves.
          A long, silent beat. Then, Henri stands.

                         HENRI
          He's right. The beast broke the
          peace, not us.

                         (TO CESAIRE)
          I will help you kill it.
          Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after
          another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too.

                         REEVE
          As will I. We all will.
          Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle.

          Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red
          riding hood. She gives it a solemn look.

          A light snow has fallen. The girls are walking to

          Who gave you permission to wear
          that?

                         ISABELLE
          Nobody. I just --

                         SUZETTE
          Your Grandmother made that for
          Lucie. Take it off.
          Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette
          snatches the cloak away from her. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          It was folded when they found her.
          Her clothes, too. Did you notice
          that?

                         SUZETTE
          Someone must have folded them.
          A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts...

                         ISABELLE
          She was so unhappy.
          Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.

                         SUZETTE
          What are you saying?

                         ISABELLE
          Maybe she went into the woods on
          purpose. Maybe she wanted to die.
          Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie's soul is at peace with God.
          Don't you ever again suggest
          otherwise.
          Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned
          speechless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle
          cottage. If there had been train tracks in the
          fourteenth century, this place would have been on the
          wrong side of them.
          Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
          long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a
          surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears.

                         PETER
          Are you all right?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry. I just need to talk to
          someone. Can I come in?
          Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
          can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's
          standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.

                         ROSEMARIA
          No. You can't.
          She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives
          him a stricken look and runs away. Peter watches her go.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except
          for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria
          gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have
          gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          I hate the cold. Why can't we
          have lessons in the summer?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I suppose that would be easier.
          But then that would defeat the
          purpose. People only change when
          things are difficult.
          Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns
          away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then
          leaves her alone. Isabelle stares into the fire...

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene: her mother,
          Marguerite, half-naked and wrapped in a blanket,

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CONTINUED:
          viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne
          hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away.

                         MARGUERITE
          I caught the little bastard
          watching us!

                         ROXANNE
          Watching what?
          Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom,
          adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees
          Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and
          leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse.
          Roxanne glares at her.

                         MARGUERITE
          It's money, isn't it? You could
          make twice this your first time.
          They pay more for virgins.
          Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          The full moon sign swings in the wind, a few flakes of
          snow whipping through the air around it.

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe. He hands the
          hammer to Henri, fixing him with a serious look.

                         ADRIEN
          Don't do this for Isabelle. She
          can't marry you if you're dead.

                         HENRI

                         (LYING)
          I'm not doing it for her.

                         ADRIEN
          Your mother would be proud to see
          the man you've become.
          Henri is moved. He nods, at a loss for words.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - DUSK

          Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided
          to brew some beer and sell it. Cesaire stands before a
          group of men. They've all had too much to drink.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          My father died trying to kill the
          Wolf. For forty years, we have
          lived in fear of it. But no more.
          And never again. We don't need a
          Witchfinder General to rid of us
          this hell-hated beast. Because by
          God and all that is holy, the
          Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e shall
          die tonight!
          The men CHEER.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets. The
          rest of the Villagers line the streets, watching them go.
          Claude tries to join the hunters, thinking it's a game,
          but Roxanne quickly catches him. Peter shakes his head
          at the dubious spectacle. Henri sees him.

                         HENRI
          You're not coming with us?

                         PETER
          Are you joking? These fools are
          as likely to kill each other as
          they are anything else.
          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle
          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.
          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,
          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When
          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks
          away. Henri gives Peter a gloating look. Peter scowls.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DUSK

          The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline,
          one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village.
          They each have lit torches. CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched
          in the brush. Cesaire walks along the line of men.

                         CESAIRE
          Get that torch out.
          Henri douses his torch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The full moon is high in the night sky. Snow is falling.
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.
          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.
          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,
          staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake. Suddenly... a
          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,
          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the
          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The
          Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          The HOWLING is getting closer. Isabelle goes to the
          window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out... and is
          startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it
          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are
          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him
          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --
          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.

                         REEVE
          Who was that screaming?

                         CARPENTER
          I don't know.

                         MERCHANT
          Look.
          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a
          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.
          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time
          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary
          look, but then start after it.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered
          brush is as high as their waists. They pause and listen.
          Only silence. They carefully make their way in the
          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves
          CRUNCH under their feet...
          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.
          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,
          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.
          He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet.

                         REEVE
          Which way did it go?
          The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve
          plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky
          hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS
          again. The Men look up at the hillside.

                         CARPENTER
          The caves. It's in the caves.

          INT. CAVE - NIGHT

          The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting
          their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The
          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark
          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...
          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they
          approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The
          SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell
          where it's coming from.

                         REEVE
          Split up. Two groups.
          Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow
          the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men
          crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be
          getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening.
          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The
          SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch
          inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave

                         CONTINUED:
          floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the
          wall to keep from falling...
          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep
          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop
          himself, and then --
          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.
          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.
          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning
          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood
          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.
          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...
          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's
          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood
          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --
          -- just as the wolf attacks.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing
          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.
          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and
          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or
          failure. But as they near...
          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike
          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,
          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle
          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.
          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back
          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and
          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle
          enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I heard your father wounded the
          beast. He was a brave man.

                         HENRI
          Did you hear what it did to him?
          It chewed off his private parts.
          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.

                         HENRI
          And I did nothing. I was too
          scared. I couldn't move. I just
          let my father be eaten alive.
          She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.

                         HENRI
          No. I don't want you here.
          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
          keeps hammering away on the anvil.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses
          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with
          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:

                         LUCRECE
          I thought your mother would be
          here. They used to be quite
          close.
          Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing
          more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden
          realization...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as
          she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes
          her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then:

                         ISABELLE
          You told me you had a sweetheart
          before you were married. It was
          Henri's father, wasn't it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie was in love with Henri. She
          could have married him.
          (off Suzette's look)
          Couldn't she have?

                         SUZETTE
          We arranged for you to marry him.

                         ISABELLE
          But you gained the same no matter
          which one of us married him. So
          why did it have to be me?

                         SUZETTE
          I think you know the answer to
          that question.

                         ISABELLE
          No. You say it.
          Suzette's eyes well up. Then:

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie was Henri's half-sister.
          She was not your father's
          daughter.
          Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:

                         ISABELLE
          Am I? Do you even know?

                         SUZETTE
          Yes. I was already pregnant when
          your father and I married.

                         ISABELLE
          Does he know?

                         SUZETTE
          No. And he must never know.
          Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.

                         SUZETTE
          Isabelle!

                         (BEAT)
          Promise me you won't tell him.
          Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She
          leaves without answering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to
          Isabelle. Isabelle's eyes are red from crying.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I've found that there's no burden
          that doesn't at least seem a
          little lighter on a full stomach.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know what to do. She
          wants me to pretend like I don't
          know. How am I supposed to go on
          living in that house?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have a right to be angry with
          her. But try not to hate her.
          Too much hate will eat you alive.
          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
          shoulder.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and
          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

                         CESAIRE
          You're a good girl.
          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
          chest, and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children
          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
          Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          I heard there's going to be a
          festival on the night of the next
          full moon. To celebrate.

                         ROXANNE
          A festival? I've never been to
          one!

                         PRUDENCE
          My father says he hasn't seen one
          since he was a boy.

                         ROXANNE
          It's strange, isn't it? You think
          because things have been a certain
          way your whole life that they'll
          always be the same. Then
          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is Villiers la CroisÃ©e?

                         MERCHANT
          Yes, my lord.

                         CAPTAIN
          Summon your bailiff. My master
          would speak with him at once.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

                         MERCHANT
          Of course, my lord. May I ask to
          what does he owe this honor?

                         CAPTAIN
          He requested the services of His
          Eminence, the Witchfinder General.
          You may tell him that he has
          arrived.
          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is indeed an honor, Your
          Eminence.
          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

                         ATTEWATER
          As you can see, our werewolf
          problem has been dealt with.

                         SOLOMON
          That is no werewolf.
          Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle
          and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.

                         SOLOMON
          When a werewolf dies, it returns
          to its human form. If what you
          killed was a werewolf, then you
          would have a human head skewered
          atop that pole.

                         REEVE
          And I suppose you've seen this? A
          wolf turning into a man?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:
          Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
          toward him. The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without
          doubt, the bigger man. The Reeve's eyes flick nervously
          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          My wife's name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She
          was very pretty. And we were very
          happy.
          The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.

                         SOLOMON
          We lived in a village not unlike
          this place. And not unlike this
          place, our village was plagued by
          a werewolf. I went out with some
          men to hunt it. It never even
          occurred to me that we might
          actually find it. But we did.
          He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.

                         SOLOMON
          It attacked me. All I saw were
          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked
          it up and put it in my sack.

                         (BEAT)
          When I returned home in the
          morning, I found my wife with a
          bloody rag tied around her left
          wrist. And when I opened my sack,
          the werewolf's paw was gone. This
          is what I found in its place.
          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.

                         SOLOMON
          Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was
          very pretty. And we were very
          happy. Until the day I killed
          her.
          Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.

                         SOLOMON
          Your werewolf is still alive. And
          I promise you, it will kill again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit
          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain
          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the
          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is
          shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it.

                         SOLOMON
          I have examined the body of your
          blacksmith. There were bruises on
          his neck from where the beast held
          him in its jaws, squeezing his
          throat so that he could not
          scream.

                         CESAIRE
          But he did scream. We all heard
          him.

                         SOLOMON
          Only when it wanted you to. It
          used him as bait to lure you into
          the bit of theater it had
          prepared.

                         HENRI
          Theater? My father is not
          playacting. He is dead.

                         REEVE
          And I killed the beast that did
          it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's what it wants you to think.
          It did kill your blacksmith. But
          the animal that you killed was not
          the werewolf.

                         REEVE
          There was blood dripping from its
          teeth.

                         SOLOMON
          The blood was its own. The
          werewolf most likely wounded it
          earlier in the evening and left it
          in the cave for you to find and
          kill.

                         CESAIRE
          'Most likely,' he says. Have you
          ever heard anything more unlikely
          in your lives?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.

                         ATTEWATER
          Your Eminence, if what you say is
          true, that we were somehow fooled
          by this thing, it could not have
          done so without foreknowledge of
          our plan to hunt it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's correct. The werewolf does
          not live in the forest as you have
          rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives
          here in the village. Among you.
          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.

                         CESAIRE
          You come here and tell us that
          this boy's father died for
          nothing. You accuse us and call
          us fools. Well, I believe what I
          can see with my own eyes. That
          wolf is dead. And I know it's
          dead because I was with the brave
          men who killed it.

                         MERCHANT
          And what of the festival?

                         ATTEWATER
          The festival was to celebrate the
          death of the Wolf.

                         MERCHANT
          And we say that it's dead! We've
          spent every full moon for the past
          forty years cowering in our homes.
          We've earned a celebration.

                         REEVE
          And paid for it in blood!
          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Have your festival. I will stay
          on here until then to ensure that
          you have the celebration you all
          so richly deserve.
          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
          Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain.
          Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has
          been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe. Despite the
          cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water
          from a basin held by Father Auguste...

                         SOLOMON
          Gloria Patri, et Filio, et
          Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in
          principio, et nunc, et sempter, et
          in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with
          ribbons. Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand.
          Suzette knits.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to the festival.

                         SUZETTE
          All right then.
          She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon kneels in prayer, lit by flickering candlelight.
          He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The festival is in full swing. A bonfire ROARS. The
          Villagers sing and drink. A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
          out and startles the women and children. The children
          chase him with sticks and he comically runs away.
          Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence.
          Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
          costume, but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him.
          Another BOY steals his cap and teases him. Marguerite is
          too busy carousing to notice. Roxanne frowns.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sorry...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CONTINUED:
          She hurries to help Claude. Isabelle and Prudence watch.

                         PRUDENCE
          She acts more like a mother to him
          than a sister.

                         ISABELLE
          Someone has to look after him.

                         PRUDENCE
          I know. But who looks after her?
          Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - DUSK

          The Captain of Solomon's guard stands watch. The sounds
          of the FESTIVAL can be heard in the distance...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Men play MUSIC and couples dance. Roxanne dances with
          Claude, Prudence with an OLDER BOY... but Isabelle sits
          alone, watching Peter dance with Rosemaria.
          Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer,
          clearly the latest of many. He follows her look and sees
          that she's watching Peter. Henri glares at him...
          ... then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
          him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around. Peter
          is surprised, but ready to laugh it off.

                         PETER
          Take it easy, friend.

                         HENRI
          You didn't come with us. The
          night my father died.
          Peter's smile fades. Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away.

                         HENRI
          You stayed here and let real men
          do the work you didn't have the
          belly for.

                         ISABELLE
          Please, don't do this --
          Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles.
          Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist. Henri

                         CONTINUED:
          overreacts and punches Peter in the eye. Peter falls on
          his ass, but the Villagers just laugh.
          Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down. He could easily
          lay Henri out... but decides against it. He leaves.
          Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her.
          Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries
          off after Peter. Henri watches her go, ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Peter storms off. Isabelle runs after him.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter! Wait!

                         PETER
          Why? So you can hit me, too?

                         ISABELLE
          I just want to make sure you're
          all right.
          Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.

                         PETER
          Why can't you just leave me alone?

                         ISABELLE
          You're bleeding.

                         PETER
          So what? What's the matter with
          you? What do I have to do to make
          you stop caring about me?
          Isabelle is taken aback. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          You think I want to feel like
          this? You think I enjoy feeling
          like a fool every day because I
          can't stop loving you?
          Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what
          her words do to him. She looks up at him, realizing...

                         ISABELLE
          Why are you with Rosemaria? You
          hate Rosemaria.

                         PETER
          I don't have to like her to get
          what I want from her.

                         ISABELLE
          You're a terrible liar.
          Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
          hand against his chest. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          There. You're heart is starting
          to beat faster. And the little
          black circles in the middle of
          your eyes still get bigger when I
          touch you.
          She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes,
          but can't stop himself.

                         ISABELLE
          You can tell me you don't love me,
          but I know what you're really
          feeling. I can feel it with my
          hand and see it with my eyes.
          Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.

                         PETER
          I thought being with Rosemaria
          would be the one thing you would
          never be able to forgive. I
          wanted you to hate me.
          (off her look)
          Isabelle, you are the best thing
          that could ever happen to me. And
          I am the worst thing that could
          ever happen to you.

                         ISABELLE
          How could you think that?

                         PETER
          I wasn't born here. You and I
          both know what that means. I will
          always be a stranger to these
          people. Your parents will never
          let us be together.

                         ISABELLE
          That means less to me now than
          ever. We can leave here. We can
          go someplace where we'll both be
          strangers.

                         PETER
          I can't let you do that. You have
          something here that I will never
          have. You have a place. You have

          ruin that over me.

                         ISABELLE
          The only life I want is with you.

                         PETER
          Isabelle... I'm wrong for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I know you are. I just don't
          care.
          She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as
          if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he
          takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard.

          INT. BARN - DUSK

          A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing.
          He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body.
          He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall. She
          looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to
          her, kissing him hard. She grabs his hand and guides it
          to her breast. Now Peter looks surprised. He hesitates.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want to wait.

                         PETER
          But not like this.

                         (A BEAT)
          I want to marry you.
          She searches his face and sees that he's serious.

                         PETER
          I can pack the cart tonight and we
          can leave in the morning.
          (off her look)
          Is that too soon?

                         ISABELLE
          It's not soon enough.
          She pulls him to her and kisses him.

          EXT. BARN - DUSK

          Peter looks outside. The coast is clear. He and
          Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them.

          You'd better get back before
          someone misses you.
          She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from
          him, he sees that she's crying.

                         PETER
          What's wrong?

                         ISABELLE
          This feels like a dream. I'm
          afraid if I leave you I might wake
          up.
          He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them
          notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns to the festival. She sits next to
          Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair.
          Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set.
          The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up
          at it, transfixed. Roxanne looks over at her, curious.

                         ISABELLE
          I've never seen it full before...
          Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone
          falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then,
          somewhere in the dark...
          ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams.
          People start to panic. Claude is knocked down.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!
          Then something massive pushes its way through the surging
          crowd, bursting from the darkness...
          It's THE WOLF. The Villagers gape in horror. It makes
          the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But
          there's something about its face that isn't canine at
          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.
          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,
          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it
          surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them.

                         CONTINUED:
          A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on
          his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden
          eagle. He tugs the reins and his horse rears back.

                         SOLOMON
          Get to the church, you fools!
          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:

                         SOLOMON

          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S

          HOLY LOVE!
          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.
          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

                         ROXANNE
          Where's Claude? Where is he?!

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

                         ROXANNE
          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT

          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

          ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

          You have to stop it. He can't
          hear you and you are going to get
          us killed. Do you understand me?
          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on!
          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

                         THE WOLF
          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

                         THE WOLF
          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being
          impolite, Isabelle?

                         ISABELLE
          How do you know me? Who are you?

                         ROXANNE
          Isabelle...?
          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

          56.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          What big eyes you have...

                         THE WOLF
          The better to see you with, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you going to kill us?

                         THE WOLF
          Kill you? Why would I kill you?

                         ISABELLE
          Then what do you want?

                         THE WOLF
          I want you, Isabelle.
          Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.

                         THE WOLF
          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

                         THE WOLF
          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

                         THE WOLF
          Leave with me tonight. Run with
          me. The only shackles binding you
          are of your own making. Slip them
          and I can show you the world and
          every pleasure in it.
          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know who you are, but we
          are not the same. I would rather
          die than go with you.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         THE WOLF
          What about your fat friend here?
          Do you think she would rather die?
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Come away with me. Or I will kill
          her. And I will keep killing
          until you agree to leave with me.
          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.

                         THE WOLF
          Choose now. Quickly.
          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.

                         THE WOLF
          Your silence has doomed them all.
          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:

                         THE WOLF
          Come the next full moon, their
          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne
          inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon.

                         SOLOMON
          We are safe here. God protects
          his own house and those within it.
          Isabelle finds Prudence.

                         ISABELLE
          Is Peter here?

                         PRUDENCE
          Peter? I don't think so.

                         ISABELLE
          What about Claude? Or my parents?

                         PRUDENCE
          I haven't seen any of them.

          58.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Would you look for them? Please?
          Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a
          corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.

                         ROXANNE
          You talked to it.

                         ISABELLE
          It talked to us.
          A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.

                         ROXANNE
          No. It only growled.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          You heard it talk to you?
          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to
          see if anyone has overheard. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Do not speak of this to anyone.
          Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns
          away, afraid and confused.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN

          Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers
          out. A blanket of new snow covers the village. It's as
          if the massacre of the night before never happened.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A
          chair has been overturned. The room is empty.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother! Father!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and
          Cesaire leaning over her, crying. Isabelle stops short.

                         ISABELLE
          Is she dead?

                         CESAIRE
          No, thank God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been
          horribly slashed from scalp to chin. Isabelle recoils.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers slowly gather. Dead bodies litter the
          snow. Roxanne clutches Prudence's arm. Henri joins
          them. Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier #1.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          This man is alive!

                         (TO HENRI)
          Bring me water! Hurry!
          Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
          Solomon's iron grip on his arm. Solomon and his Captain
          go to Soldier #1. Solomon kneels at his side.

                         SOLOMON
          Are you bitten?
          Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his
          eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Step back.
          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
          into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.

                         SOLOMON
          The werewolf's bite is the same as
          death to a man.
          Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          The dark days have returned to
          your village. Your homes are no
          longer safe. The Wolf will
          return. Again and again. And it
          will not stop until it has sucked
          the marrow from all your bones.
          Unless you stop it.

                         (BEAT)
          But to kill a monster, you must
          become one yourself. A wolf
          caught in a trap will chew off its
          own leg to save itself. Will you
          do the same? What sacrifice will
          you make to save your families and
          your way of life? Will you do
          whatever it takes? Or will you

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          cower in your beds and die like
          sheep?
          A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
          cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.

                         SOLOMON
          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to
          believe.
          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

                         ATTEWATER
          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

                         PETER
          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

                         PETER
          I thought you didn't want to wait.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't have any choice. It's not
          just my mother. Something else
          happened last night.
          (off his look)

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell you about it. I just
          have to stay.
          Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I meant everything I said. This
          isn't what I wanted.

                         PETER
          Of course not. You'd better go
          home and see to your mother.
          She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
          the door, but he doesn't look at her. She leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
          Attewater and Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Silver. This is our most potent
          weapon. One blow will kill it.

                         (BEAT)
          That sword has tasted the blood of
          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

                         ATTEWATER
          If it's that powerful, how can we
          possibly hope to stop it?

                         SOLOMON
          We must find it in its human form.
          Who among you do you suspect?
          Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
          Neither of them wants to speak up first.

                         SOLOMON
          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but
          we must start somewhere.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          What about the hair Madame
          Ordeville found on Lucie's body?
          It was dark. The person we are
          looking for must have dark hair.

          62.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Perhaps. Unless it planted the
          hair to make us think that.

                         ATTEWATER
          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

                         SOLOMON
          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          The curse is hereditary?

                         SOLOMON
          It is. But it effects men and
          women differently. A man can
          inherit the curse. Or he can be
          turned simply by being bitten.
          Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.

                         SOLOMON
          But women are immune to the
          werewolf's bite. In order for a
          woman to be turned, she must
          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

                         ATTEWATER
          But it could be a woman.

                         SOLOMON
          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

          The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne
          at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          Has Claude come home?

                         ROXANNE
          No. Nobody has seen him.

                         ISABELLE
          He's run away before. He'll be
          all right.
          Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They
          all exchange a sad look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Well. I suppose this is all of
          us.
          The three of them turn and start toward the woods...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It talked to you. And you
          understood it?

                         ISABELLE
          As clearly as I do you now.
          Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Word of this cannot be allowed to
          spread. Do you understand me?

                         ISABELLE
          Roxanne will never speak of it.
          She won't even talk to me about
          it.
          A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I have to do what it wants.
          (off her look)
          I have communed with an unholy
          beast. What does that make me if
          not cursed?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I don't know. But I won't allow
          you to go with this devil and live
          as its concubine.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          But if it comes back for me and I
          don't go with it, then it will
          kill again. If I have the power
          to save even one life, aren't I
          compelled to do so?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          This is why it chose you. You're
          a good girl with a gentle heart.
          It's using that against you.

                         ISABELLE
          But how could it? Unless it
          really does know me?
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is
          waiting for her. A beat. Then:

                         HENRI
          I spoke with your father. I broke
          off our engagement.
          (off her look)
          I saw you with Peter. Don't
          worry, I didn't tell anyone.
          Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously.

                         ISABELLE
          What about my family's debt?

                         HENRI
          I have no interest in ruining your
          family. I will have you out of
          love or not at all.
          Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought. Suddenly, there's
          a KNOCK at the door. Isabelle opens it. It's Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          They've caught the werewolf!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village.
          There are SHOUTING VOICES up ahead.

                         PRUDENCE
          He's been hiding in a hayloft.
          They caught him trying to steal
          food.

                         ISABELLE
          But who is it?
          An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
          that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob.
          Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way
          through the crowd.

                         ISABELLE
          What's wrong? What's happening?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd.
          Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her.

                         CESAIRE
          Isabelle! Get away from there!
          She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as
          two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!!

                         ISABELLE
          It's not him! It can't be!

                         LUCRECE
          If he's not the werewolf, then why
          was he hiding? What's he afraid
          of?
          The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
          them. Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her.
          She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

          Villagers are gathering. The whole town must be here.
          As Attewater approaches the entrance:

          GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
          Salus populi suprema est lex.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She
          nods to the inscription above the entrance. 'SALUS

          POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX.'

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The good of the people is the
          chief law.

                         ATTEWATER
          You read Latin.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And write. I was studying to be a
          nun when I met my husband.

                         ATTEWATER
          He must have been some man.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He was a priest.
          She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You know the boy is innocent.
          He's being tried because he's
          different. Because Father Solomon
          knows he can turn us against him.

                         ATTEWATER
          Father Solomon is here to protect
          us.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          A wolf hunting sheep picks off the
          weakest ones first.
          (off his look)
          This is just the beginning.
          She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The room is crammed with Villagers. Isabelle sits with
          Cesaire and Grandmother. Attewater sits behind the
          table. Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers. He
          looks afraid, confused. Solomon questions Lucrece. A
          SCRIBE records the proceedings.

                         SOLOMON
          You say you saw the accused
          perform magic?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

                         LUCRECE
          In broad daylight with my own
          eyes. Everyone here has seen it.

                         SOLOMON
          So it was common knowledge that
          the accused was a conjurer?

                         LUCRECE
          Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for
          the Devil's work, but they laughed
          at me and paid him money.
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look.
          Through a SERIES OF CUTS, more witnesses are questioned:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him...

                         SOLOMON
          Are you aware that it is the
          custom of witches and devil
          worshippers to hold their black
          sabbaths in cemeteries?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Yes, Your Eminence.

                         SOLOMON
          And do you know of their practice
          of dancing with invisible devils
          during these rituals?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I have heard it said so, yes.

                         SOLOMON
          Is there one here today who you
          have seen dancing in your
          cemetery?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          (hesitant; a beat)
          Yes. But I don't believe he meant
          anything by it. It was in jest.

                         SOLOMON
          So you consider the black mass to
          be a jest?
          There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers.
          Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          No, of course not.

                         SOLOMON
          Then point him out.
          Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.

                         MARGUERITE
          Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude.

                         SOLOMON
          What is your relationship to the
          accused?

                         MARGUERITE
          I am his mother.

                         SOLOMON
          And where is his father?

                         MARGUERITE
          I don't know, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, what is his name?
          She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.

                         MARGUERITE
          I never learned his name, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          You say a man whose name you
          cannot recall is the father of
          your child? What can you tell us
          about him?

                         MARGUERITE
          Not much, sir.
          She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her.

                         SOLOMON
          Almost as if it were a dream?
          (off her look)
          Certain devils called incubi can
          collect human semen and then
          transfer it to women as they
          sleep. A woman who unwittingly
          conceives in this manner would not
          be a whore. She would be
          blameless in the eyes of God.

          69.

                         CONTINUED:
          Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful...

                         SOLOMON
          You remember almost nothing of the
          man who impregnated you. Is it
          not possible that there was no
          man? That the accused is not the
          product of your own sin, but the
          foul offspring of a werewolf whose
          semen was placed in you by an
          incubus while you slept?

                         MARGUERITE
          Yes! Yes, I remember now! He
          came to me in my sleep! It wasn't
          my fault! God save me, it wasn't
          my fault!
          Roxanne buries her face in her hands.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER)

          Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          We have proven here today that
          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the
          accused has refused to confess,
          this court calls upon its final
          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.
          Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

          Isabelle stands before Solomon. Claude waves. She
          ignores him.

                         SOLOMON
          On the night of the last full
          moon, you were attacked by the
          Wolf. You looked it in the eye.
          And the one thing a werewolf can
          never change is its eyes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CONTINUED:
          He gestures to the Soldiers. They grab Claude and force
          him to look at her.

                         SOLOMON
          Look into his eyes, my child. Do
          you see the beast in them?
          Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
          expectant. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          It isn't him. It can't be. He
          was with us when the Wolf
          attacked.
          Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.

                         SOLOMON
          Is this true? Is there another
          here who can speak to this?

                         ROXANNE
          I can! It's true! I saw him!

                         LUCRECE
          She's his sister! She'll say
          anything!
          The suspicious Villagers agree. Roxanne gives Isabelle a
          desperate look. Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter.

                         ISABELLE
          He was there! He carried Claude
          away! He saved his life!
          Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
          back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.

                         CARPENTER
          She is mistaken. I did no such
          thing.
          Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
          but no one will speak up. Solomon frowns.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Since no one here can
          bear witness, we must extort a
          confession. This court shall
          reconvene tomorrow at dawn.
          Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
          Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table. Cesaire is in
          the other room feeding Suzette.

                         ISABELLE
          Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen
          to me? Doesn't he care that
          Claude isn't guilty?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He'd rather let an innocent boy
          die than risk letting the Wolf go
          free.

                         ISABELLE
          But the Wolf is free. And the
          moon will be full in two days.
          The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
          close, lowers her voice.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          We both know it will be coming for
          you. You must leave here tomorrow
          and never return.
          A long beat. Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          I cannot leave.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have no choice. The
          alternative is unthinkable.

                         ISABELLE
          What is unthinkable is that I
          should be responsible for the
          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf's sins are on its own
          twice-damned soul, not yours.

                         ISABELLE
          But what if it was you it wanted?
          Would you go with it to save me?
          Or would you leave me to die?
          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
          night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother and Isabelle step outside, followed by
          Cesaire. The SCREAMING can be heard more clearly.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon. Extorting his
          confession.
          Claude's screams sending chills down their spines.

                         CESAIRE
          You should have condemned him
          today. At least it would have
          been quick.
          Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
          Grandmother continue to listen.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears,
          trying to block out the SCREAMING. Her mother sits by
          the fire as if nothing unusual is going on.

                         ROXANNE
          How can you just sit there and
          listen to this?
          Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
          grabs Marguerite's coin purse.

                         MARGUERITE
          Where are you going with that?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't you touch me again. Ever.
          Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - NIGHT

          A fire burns underneath a 'Brazen Bull,' a hollow, life-
          size bull made of brass. The fire heats the metal to
          almost red-hot. Claude's screams come from inside it.
          Solomon glowers, frustrated. Attewater looks sick.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Enough of this. Let's eat.
          He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a
          document.

                         ATTEWATER
          What is this?

                         SOLOMON
          A statement declaring that you
          heard the boy confess. All it
          requires is your signature. Or
          your mark, if you cannot write.

                         ATTEWATER
          But he has not confessed. How
          could he have?
          Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Listen more carefully
          this time.
          He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
          fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All
          he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull.
          The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.

                         SOLOMON
          Listen to how he sings of his love
          of Satan. How he despairs that he
          will never again copulate with the
          dead or sink his teeth into the
          flesh of pregnant women and eat
          their unborn children.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly
          realizing. Father Solomon is insane.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop this.

                         SOLOMON
          No. You stop it.
          (off his look)
          We both know he is guilty. But I
          cannot legally execute him without
          a witness or a confession. Sign
          this and we have a confession.
          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the
          document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the
          bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags
          him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude.
          Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f.g. His
          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.

                         SOLOMON
          This is the business of werewolf
          hunting and you had best develop a
          stomach for it. Because where
          there is one werewolf, there are
          two. And where there are two,
          there are more.

                         (BEAT)
          This is only the beginning.
          Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater
          trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon is eating dinner. The Captain enters.

                         CAPTAIN
          A girl to see you.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, I've yet to come across a
          girl I wouldn't at least look at.
          The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps
          forward. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          I assume you came here with a
          purpose.
          She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in
          front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins.

                         ROXANNE
          I would like to bargain for the
          release of my brother.

                         SOLOMON
          Your brother has just confessed.

                         ROXANNE
          What? That's not possible!

                         SOLOMON
          It has been witnessed and
          notarized. He will hang in the
          morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she
          is about to say. Realizing that she has no choice.

                         ROXANNE
          I have more than money to offer
          you.
          She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
          bodice, but Solomon interrupts.

                         SOLOMON
          What do you think you are doing?
          (off her look)
          Do you have any idea who I am? I
          am the Witchfinder General. I
          have fought in the Holy Land. I
          have waded hip deep in blood and
          resisted all the temptations of
          the infidels. And you seek to
          stay the hand of justice with such
          a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl,
          before I have you whipped.
          Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
          her away. Roxanne struggles against them.

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have something else! I
          know the name of a witch!
          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She
          cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life...

                         ROXANNE
          Spare my brother and I will tell
          you her name.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their
          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.
          Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind
          her. She huddles against the wall, shivering.

          76.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She
          looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...
          It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body
          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle
          chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly
          takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The chamber is full again. Cesaire, Grandmother,
          Prudence, and Henri are here. Peter sits in the last
          row. Isabelle is in the seat of the accused. Roxanne
          stands witness. She's trying not to look at Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          How are you acquainted with the
          accused?

                         ROXANNE
          We were friends.

                         SOLOMON
          And how long did this friendship
          last?

                         ROXANNE
          All my life.

                         SOLOMON
          And in this time, have you ever
          known the accused to converse with
          devils?

                         ROXANNE
          Yes, Your Eminence. On the night
          of the last full moon, she talked
          to the werewolf. And later she
          told me that it also talked to
          her.
          Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
          clenches his fist. Solomon turns to Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          What of this? Do you deny having
          conversed with a werewolf?
          She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          No. I do not deny it.
          The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.

          77.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Describe this encounter.

                         ISABELLE
          It spoke, just as a man speaks.

                         SOLOMON
          And what was the nature of your
          conversation with it?
          Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.

                         ISABELLE
          It told me... It promised to
          leave here and never return. But
          only if I leave with it.
          Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
          over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:

                         REEVE
          But who is it? Make her tell us
          who the werewolf is!

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know! I swear I don't
          know!

                         MERCHANT
          It doesn't matter who it is
          anymore. It wants her, not us.
          Let's just give it what it wants.
          A long, tense beat. Heavy silence. Nobody speaks.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          We should not allow ourselves to
          even consider this.

                         REEVE
          I think we already are.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What's the matter with you? You
          know her. You all know her.

                         REEVE
          Do we? Did we know she could talk
          to werewolves?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She could have run away. She
          could saved herself, but she
          stayed here because she cares more
          about you than she does herself.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Peter reacts. He and Isabelle exchange a look. Now he
          understands...

                         MERCHANT
          If she stayed, she did so because
          she is in league with it. Let
          this be her punishment.
          The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
          gives Attewater a dark look. Then:

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in
          light of your willing confession,
          it is the decision of this court
          that on the night of the next full
          moon, you be left to the mercy of
          the werewolf.
          Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.

                         HENRI
          No!
          Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads. Isabelle is led
          away. Roxanne can only watch, helpless and ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well.
          Prudence pauses to hear what she's saying...

                         LUCRECE
          The first victim was her sister.
          The second was her fiancÃ©e's
          father. Then Rosemaria, who
          everyone knows she hated. And
          don't forget her mother, with half
          her face missing. All this death
          around one girl...
          Prudence has heard enough. She turns away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Roxanne approaches. The Captain eyes her, questioning.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm here for my brother.
          He gestures. Roxanne turns... and sees Claude's body
          dangling from a makeshift gallows. He's been hanged.

          79.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne falls to her knees. The rope around Claude's
          neck CREAKS as his body sways in the wind.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on
          the other side. They speak in furtive whispers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I'm not going to let these
          worthless shits sacrifice you to
          save themselves. We have to find
          the real werewolf before tomorrow
          night.

                         ISABELLE
          That's impossible. Even Father
          Solomon doesn't have the first
          clue.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon doesn't know the
          things that I know.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          I am the oldest person in this
          village who was here when the Wolf
          first came. I remember the old
          days. And what is happening now
          is much worse.

                         ISABELLE
          What was it like in the old days?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf never used to attack in
          the open like it did at the
          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

                         ISABELLE
          It's grown bold.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Or perhaps it made a mistake.

                         (BEAT)
          You're at the center of this. At
          least two of the victims can be
          tied to you. What if it had to
          kill so many at the festival to
          hide the fact that the first two
          killings weren't random?

          80.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes...

                         ISABELLE
          But who would want to kill Lucie?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents said that the Wolf
          broke into the house and took
          Lucie. We both know that's not
          true. What really happened?
          Isabelle hesitates, reluctant.

                         ISABELLE
          My mother made me swear I would
          never speak of it.

                         (BEAT)
          Lucie went to the Wolf willingly.
          Grandmother reacts, horrified.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why would you think such a thing?

                         ISABELLE
          She was in love with Henri.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She took her own life over a boy?

                         ISABELLE
          What other explanation is there?
          Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Hello, Henri.

          INT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother
          stands by the door, watching him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You spoke up very loudly in
          Isabelle's defense today. That
          was very brave.

                         HENRI
          I just said what I felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You're under no obligation to
          stand in her defense. You broke
          off your engagement to her.

                         HENRI
          I never stopped caring about her.
          I would do anything for Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          As her sister would have done
          anything for you.
          (off his look)
          Lucie was in love with you. But
          you knew that, didn't you?

                         HENRI
          I had no control over the way she
          felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She kept it secret from almost
          everyone. Even Isabelle didn't
          know. Did you tell anyone?

                         HENRI
          Never.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not even your father?

                         HENRI
          I didn't have to tell him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          So he knew your secrets, did he?
          Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily
          nailing a shoe to the horse's foot. BANG! BANG! BANG!

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You were the only one who could
          have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's
          night. And none of the men who
          went hunting for the Wolf remember
          seeing you after the sun set on
          the night your father died.
          Henri faces her, clutching the hammer...

                         HENRI
          Why are you doing this?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because I want you to confess.
          You killed Lucie. And your
          father. And God only knows how
          many others. And if you won't
          admit it, then I will tell Father
          Solomon and we will lock you up
          until the moon rises tomorrow
          night and you can no longer hide
          your guilt.
          As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization
          comes over him. Realization and horror.

                         HENRI
          It's you.
          Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps
          back and finds herself bumping against the closed door.

                         HENRI
          My God, it's you. You're the
          Wolf. I can smell it on you now.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Smell what? What are you talking
          about?

                         HENRI
          The night my father died. I saw
          the Wolf pass by, dragging him by
          the neck. I was so terrified I
          couldn't move or make a sound. I
          remember every detail of that
          moment. The way the moonlight
          gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The
          soundless way it moved. I even
          remember the way it smelled. A
          thick, greasy, musky stink.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can smell it on you right
          now.
          A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You accuse me and I'll bring you
          down with me. All they can do is
          take my life. You have more to
          lose.

                         HENRI
          But who do you think they'll
          believe? I'm the blacksmith.

                         HENRI (CONT'D)
          They know me. You're the crazy
          old woman who lives in the woods.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Then I'll have to prove it.

                         HENRI
          Unless you can, you'd best keep
          your mouth shut.
          Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
          door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside --

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          -- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She
          startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look.

                         CESAIRE
          Are you ready for me to take you
          home?
          She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
          holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly
          hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The
          moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence
          with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Stop the cart.
          Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Prudence, come with me. I have
          some blankets I want you to mend
          for Father Auguste.
          Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cart stops out front. Grandmother turns to Prudence.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You take these blankets to Father
          Auguste the moment you're
          finished. Understand?

          Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.
          He has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Will you want a ride into town
          tomorrow? To say goodbye to her?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yes. First thing in the morning.
          He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind
          him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She
          puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody
          speaks. The Herald hangs the full moon sign.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook. A flock of
          CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Show yourself! Coward!
          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

                         THE FIGURE
          Go away.
          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Are you all right?

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm sick. You can't come in.

                         PRUDENCE
          You sound awful. Would you like
          us to make you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No. You mustn't come in. Go
          home, now. I want to sleep.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about
          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

                         ROXANNE
          Are you sure you don't want us to
          bring you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No, my dear. Come back tomorrow.
          The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't
          see the blood pour outside under the door behind her.

          Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw. She's
          startled awake by the sound of her CELL DOOR opening.
          It's Father Auguste.

          Villagers are already gathering. The Merchant looks up
          at the sun. It's now dipping beneath the rooftops...

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Peter knocks on the door. Henri opens it. He eyes Peter
          dubiously.

                         PETER
          I need your help.
          Off Henri's look...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - DAY

          Attewater hurriedly enters and looks around. Nobody here
          except the BARMAN and Cesaire slumped in a chair, a jug
          of beer in his hand. Attewater goes to Cesaire.

                         ATTEWATER
          Where is your mother?

                         CESAIRE
          I don't know. I went to pick her
          up this morning and she was gone.

          88.

                         CONTINUED:
          Attewater reacts, concerned. Cesaire takes another
          drink. Attewater angrily knocks it out of his hand.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop pouring that swill down your
          gullet listen to me!
          Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a
          dangerous look, but Attewater doesn't shy from it.

                         ATTEWATER
          She was trying to find the
          werewolf. If she figured out who
          it is, I need to know now.
          Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,
          flanked by Soldiers. They drag Cesaire to his feet.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait! What has he done?

                         CAPTAIN
          It's just a precaution. Father
          Solomon doesn't want the girl's
          family interfering.
          Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits
          the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.
          Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground.
          The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out.
          The Soldiers drag him away. Attewater watches them go...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY

          Soldiers haul Cesaire's unconscious body downstairs.
          Isabelle watches as they throw him in another cell.

                         ISABELLE
          What have you done to him?!
          Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding
          iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The
          Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...

          CESAIRE (O.S.)
          Isabelle...
          He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,
          runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars.

                         ISABELLE
          I love you so much. Tell Mama and
          Grandmother that I love them.

          89.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          I love you, my angel. You don't
          know how much.
          The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the
          stairs. Cesaire shakes his cell door with impotent rage.

                         CESAIRE
          Bastards!

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach. The
          Captain approaches with a 'humiliation mask': an iron
          mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny
          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a
          wolf's head. Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it...
          ... then the Captain puts it over her head. Inside the
          mask: almost total darkness. The Captain locks it on.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush.
          Isabelle trudges along behind it. The Villagers line the
          road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the
          streets in her horrific iron wolf mask. Lucrece sneers.

                         LUCRECE
          Not so pretty now, is she?
          The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently
          fuming. Prudence stands next to him. She looks around.

                         PRUDENCE
          Where's Peter?

                         HENRI
          I haven't seen him.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the
          stocks. As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches,
          Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on.

                         SOLOMON
          We, Bailiff Attewater, Father
          Auguste, and Father Solomon of
          Avignon, having in mind that you,

          90.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          Flour, by your own confession,
          have committed acts of vulgar
          heresy, convict you of the sins of
          witches and condemn you to the
          mercy of werewolf. This is the
          sentence given.
          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father
          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.

                         ISABELLE
          Help...
          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.

                         ISABELLE
          Help me... Please... Help me...
          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.

                         ISABELLE

          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T

          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!
          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies
          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)

          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,
          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,
          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.

                         PRUDENCE
          Isabelle? Can you hear me?

                         ISABELLE
          I can hear you.

                         PRUDENCE
          Roxanne wanted you to know how
          sorry she is. She only said those
          things to save her brother.

                         ISABELLE
          I know. Will you tell her that I
          forgive her?

                         PRUDENCE
          Of course.

                         (BEAT)
          I wanted to say... I don't know
          what to say.

                         ISABELLE
          You don't have to say anything.

                         PRUDENCE
          I want to.

                         (BEAT)
          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

                         ISABELLE
          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

                         PRUDENCE
          Yes. It won't be long now.

          ACROSS THE SQUARE
          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

                         SOLOMON
          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

                         SOLOMON
          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

                         SOLOMON
          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

                         ISABELLE
          Get away from me!

                         HENRI
          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

                         HENRI
          I'm trying to get you out of this.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

                         CAPTAIN
          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Patience. It's close now...
          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

                         HENRI
          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

                         SOLOMON
          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

                         ATTEWATER

          RUN!
          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village.

                         HENRI
          We have to get to the stable.
          Peter left his cart for us.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter? Where is he --?

                         HENRI
          It doesn't matter. Come on!

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

                         CAPTAIN
          The witch has escaped! The witch
          has escaped!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

                         HENRI
          It's gone.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

                         REEVE
          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

          95.

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE WOLF
          You can't outrun me, my dear. And
          there is no place you can hide
          that I cannot smell you out.

                         (BEAT)
          So what is your decision? Will
          you take your place with me?

                         ISABELLE
          My place will never be with you.

                         THE WOLF
          Where do you belong then? Here?
          With the cowards who so gladly
          sacrificed you to save themselves?

                         ISABELLE
          They're still good people.

                         THE WOLF
          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

                         HENRI
          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

                         HENRI
          I need to tell you something. In
          case I die.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Your grandmother is the Wolf.
          Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          The Wolf is a man. It told me.

                         HENRI
          You believe it?
          Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out.
          The Soldiers are closing in on them...

                         HENRI
          They're coming.

                         ISABELLE
          Follow me.
          She takes his hand and leads him away.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle knocks at the door. Roxanne answers. She gives
          Isabelle a stunned look.

                         ISABELLE
          We need to come inside. Quickly.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Henri enter. Roxanne shuts the door.
          Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle.

                         MARGUERITE
          Have you lost your mind? If they
          find her here, they'll kill us,
          too!

                         ROXANNE
          Then shut up so they don't find
          her.

                         HENRI
          We have to get out of town.

                         ROXANNE
          You'll never make it. You can
          hide here until morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          They're searching everywhere. We
          have to keep moving.

                         ROXANNE
          You might make it to the church.
          Even the king cannot violate the
          protection of sanctuary.

                         HENRI
          And the Wolf cannot cross onto
          holy ground.
          The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan.

                         ISABELLE
          Can we go out your back window?
          Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have an idea.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          A group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve
          hears something coming from behind the cottage...

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Come on!
          The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
          look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window.

                         REEVE
          They're here! Over here!
          The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.

          EXT. VILLAGE - FIELD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the
          Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them.
          Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's
          Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes.

                         HENRI
          Can you keep going?

                         ROXANNE
          I can if you can.
          They run off, chased by the Villagers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

                         SOLOMON
          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

                         SOLOMON
          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

                         THE WOLF
          There is your mighty werewolf
          hunter. Who will save you now?

          100.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

                         HENRI
          You bastard! You killed my
          father!

                         ISABELLE
          Henri, what are you doing?

                         HENRI
          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

                         HENRI
          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

                         HENRI
          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

                         ISABELLE
          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

                         MERCHANT
          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

                         THE WOLF
          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

                         HENRI
          Are you all right?
          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

          SOLOMON (O.S.)
          This isn't over.
          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

                         SOLOMON
          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's
          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.
          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.

                         ISABELLE
          It's past noon.

                         SUZETTE
          I know. I didn't want to wake
          you.
          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Where's Father?

                         SUZETTE
          He'll be home soon. They have no
          reason to hold him any longer.

                         ISABELLE
          Did they catch the Wolf?

                         SUZETTE
          No. They lost it in the forest.
          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          What about Grandmother?
          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.

                         SUZETTE
          Roxanne came by. She said your
          grandmother has fallen ill. I was
          hoping you could look in on her.
          Off Isabelle's troubled look...

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red
          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower
          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping
          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.
          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops
          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the
          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.
          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

                         PETER
          Thank God you're all right.
          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help
          me.

          103.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PETER
          What did he tell you?
          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.

                         ISABELLE
          Those people back there. I know
          they mean well, but they're just
          people. I didn't expect anything
          from them. I expected something
          from you.

                         PETER
          I just need to talk to you.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to see my Grandmother.
          She's sick. Please don't follow
          me.
          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,
          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She
          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...
          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks
          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...
          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.

          EXT. GULLY - DAY

          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten
          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks
          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges
          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,
          holding onto the rope with both hands...
          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At
          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken
          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to
          catch her breath before continuing...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the
          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She
          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...

                         ISABELLE
          Grandmother? Are you awake?
          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:

          THE FIGURE (O.S.)
          Pull the bobbin. The latch will
          open.
          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK

          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.

                         REEVE
          You're certain nobody has seen him
          since last night?

                         GUARD
          The Wolf must have taken him.
          What else could have done that?
          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the
          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It
          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.
          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond
          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is
          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.
          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.

                         THE FIGURE
          I've been expecting you.
          Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...

                         ISABELLE
          Mother sent some food. There are
          cakes and a pot of butter --

          105.

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't come in here.
          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm not hungry right now.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you sure? You sound so weak.

                         THE FIGURE
          I just made myself a stew. I left
          it over the fire for you.
          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.

                         ISABELLE
          I came here to take care of you.
          Not the other way around.

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't be silly, my dear. You've
          been through so much. Sit down.
          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

                         THE FIGURE
          There's no burden so heavy that it
          doesn't seem a little lighter on a
          full stomach.

                         ISABELLE

                         (SMILES)
          You always say that.
          She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat
          looks up from its grooming, watching her...

                         THE FIGURE
          That's right. Eat up, my dear.
          Eat up.
          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.

                         ISABELLE
          I've been worried about you. When
          you didn't come back yesterday, I
          was afraid...

                         (BEAT)
          You were wrong about Henri.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         THE FIGURE
          Was I now?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. He saved my life.
          Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She
          puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...

                         ISABELLE
          I feel hot all of a sudden.

                         THE FIGURE
          It's just the stew warming you.
          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a
          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks
          of white meat...

                         ISABELLE
          What is this...?

                         THE FIGURE
          If you don't like it, there's wine
          on the table to wash it down.
          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

                         THE FIGURE
          Oh, what pretty red lips. Come
          and give your Granny a kiss, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think I want to.

                         THE FIGURE
          Then I will come to you.
          And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She
          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller
          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the
          Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles
          into the firelight, revealing its face...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled.

                         ISABELLE
          What is this? Where's
          Grandmother?

                         CESAIRE
          I'm afraid I ate most of her.

                         (BEAT)
          You ate the rest.
          Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified
          look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out.

                         CESAIRE
          I didn't want to kill her. But
          she finally realized what I was.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The hardest thing to hide has
          always been the smell. The
          werewolf musk is strong,
          especially close to the full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods,
          clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He
          sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along
          by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Henri smelled it the night he saw
          me. And he recognized the smell
          later.

          EXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles
          outside and practically runs right into Cesaire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          He thought it was your
          Grandmother. He didn't know he
          was smelling me. But she did.
          She'd lived with the smell her
          whole life, she just had no way of
          knowing what it was.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Once she realized what it was, of
          course, she knew the truth. She
          tried to sneak a message to Father
          Auguste last night.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He
          quickly looks inside them and finds a note: 'MEUS FILIUS
          EST LUPUS.' Subtitle: 'My son is the wolf.'

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Luckily, she'd taught me how to
          read.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.

                         ISABELLE
          You're not the Wolf. You can't
          be...

                         CESAIRE
          Look into my eyes. The one part
          of me I can never change.
          Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror.

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie?
          You killed my sister?

                         CESAIRE
          I did more than that to her.
          Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls.

                         CESAIRE
          I only wish your mother could have
          known what I did to her. The girl
          she passed off as my daughter.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the festival. SCREAMS can be heard coming
          from the village square. Suzette runs outside...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I was made a cuckold by your
          mother. But I paid her back.
          She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the
          Wolf. It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The wolf hunt. Adrien hears SOMETHING move in the brush.
          He looks toward it... and sees the Wolf staring at him
          from the darkness.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I paid her lover back, too.

          BACK TO SCENE
          To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Lucie was the joy of my life. But
          she wasn't mine.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, she was. In every way that
          matters, she was.

                         CESAIRE
          No. Not in every way that
          matters. My father sired me. I
          am a werewolf because it was in
          his blood. Because I was his.

                         ISABELLE
          Did Grandmother know?

                         CESAIRE
          No. And neither does your mother.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          The night Lucie died. Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but
          this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer
          before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I put an herb in the beer to make
          you sleep whenever the moon was
          full. One of your Grandmother's
          old remedies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Many years ago. Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a
          chair, holding an empty cup. Isabelle's GRANDFATHER
          takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves.
          Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          That's how my father got away with
          it. Your grandmother never
          learned the truth. Until last
          night.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Still many years ago. A werewolf runs through the
          woods... followed by a smaller werewolf.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I began to turn when I was
          fourteen. My father and I ran
          together. We hunted freely.
          Killing at will.
          The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT,
          moving in for the kill...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered. A
          group of MEN stands around it.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Our only mistake was that we
          gorged ourselves too often on the
          fat flesh of the villagers.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The two werewolves are running through the woods again,
          this time chased by VILLAGERS with torches and weapons.

                         CESAIRE
          They killed my father.
          Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled
          with sharp stakes. It CRIES OUT in agony. The smaller
          werewolf looks down and WHIMPERS...
          ... watching as the larger werewolf begins to change
          before our eyes. It's reverting to its human form...

          111.

                         CONTINUED:
          By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find
          is Grandfather's naked body skewered on the stakes. The
          smaller werewolf GROWLS at them and runs away.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The fools thought my father had
          been thrown in the pit by the
          Wolf. They never suspected that
          he was the Wolf.

          SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)
          Cesaire labors in a field. He goes to church. He
          thatches the roof of his cottage in the hot sun...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I tried to live as my father did,
          but I came to realize that I did
          not belong here. The Wolf was my
          true self. It wasn't something to
          be hidden. It was a gift. I had
          to leave here and never return.

          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire stands in the cemetery, looking down at his
          father's grave...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But I did not want to go alone.
          My father and I were part of a
          long and powerful bloodline. It
          was up to me to see that it did
          not die out. I had hoped for a
          son to pass my gift on to.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire mends a fence, but keeps glancing at something...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Instead, God gave me daughters.
          He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle. They help Suzette
          hang clothes to dry. He smiles as he watches them...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But female werewolves are not
          born. They are made. And I chose
          my eldest.
          Lucie catches him watching. She waves. He waves back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Another day. Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture.
          Lucie's face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          When I finally decided to leave, I
          told Lucie the truth. And I gave
          her a choice. She could come with
          me. Or I would take you instead.
          Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching. We realize
          that we've seen this moment before.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          She agreed to come with me. She
          did it to protect you.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Lucie sneaks out of bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          We arranged to meet on the night
          of the next full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Lucie stands naked, arms clutched around her breasts.
          Then, a NOISE in the brush. She turns and sees...

                         CESAIRE
          She was not a werewolf yet. I had
          to turn her.
          ... the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of
          bloody meat dangling from its jaws.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Later. Lucie weeps as she forces herself to eat the raw
          meat scraps. The Wolf watches, panting...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          First, she had to eat human flesh.
          I fed her from a kill I had made
          the month before. But the ritual
          was not yet complete. She had to
          be bitten by a male werewolf.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle looks like she's going to be ill.

                         CESAIRE
          The bite should have changed her.
          It should have made her like me.
          But it didn't. That's when I
          knew. There was no werewolf blood
          in her. I was not her father. I
          was so angry. I killed her before
          I even realized I was doing it.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire sits slumped in a corner, too drunk to move. A
          hand reaches in to help him. It's Isabelle.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Afterwards, I thought about
          killing myself. The only thing
          that kept me alive was you.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle helps drunk Cesaire into bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          You were so beautiful. So kind.
          And I knew you were mine. That's
          why you could understand me when
          no one else could. You were mine.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Cesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go. She
          backs into the wall. He looms over her...

                         CESAIRE
          Do you see now? This is your
          heritage. This is what you are.
          Everything I have done has been to
          insure the future of our
          bloodline. We will run together

                         CESAIRE (CONT'D)
          like my father and I once did.
          You are the next generation. You
          have had your first taste of human
          flesh. Now one bite from me is
          all that is needed to change you.
          It will only hurt for a moment.
          And then you will be as I am.

                         ISABELLE
          There must indeed be a God. For
          you are surely the Devil...

                         CESAIRE
          I will give you a choice. Come
          with me now. Or refuse me and let
          your friends suffer in your place.
          I will kill them one by one. Your
          mother. Roxanne. Peter.
          Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases
          her. She walks over to the table, her back to him. She
          eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles
          in it. A long beat. Isabelle chokes back tears.

                         ISABELLE
          Father...?
          He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand
          on her shoulder. Her skin crawls.

                         CESAIRE
          Yes, my dear?

                         ISABELLE
          You gave me two choices.
          She turns to face him. Looks up at him.

                         ISABELLE
          But I have thought of a third.
          Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into
          Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to
          his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers.
          CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table.
          The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore...
          They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his
          knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open.
          Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might
          have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor,
          staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of
          rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cottage is dark and quiet.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          It's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door.

          PETER (O.S.)
          Hello?
          No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
          opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal
          Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's
          screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger
          and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle
          provides the only light. A long beat.

                         ISABELLE
          People should know what he was.

                         PETER
          We can't tell anyone. If they
          don't believe you, they'll hang
          you for this. And if they do
          believe you, they'll hang you for
          being the daughter of the Wolf.

                         ISABELLE
          Then I'll run away. I was ready
          to run away last night.

                         (BEAT)
          Why didn't you come for me?
          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a
          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.

                         PETER
          I was bitten at the festival. I
          spent last night in the woods
          because I was afraid of what might
          happen...

                         (A BEAT)
          I changed. I'm like him now.

                         ISABELLE
          No, you're not. You could never
          be like him.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.

                         PETER
          I can't stay here.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, you can. We can still be
          together. My father lived here.
          My grandfather lived here.

                         PETER
          Your father and your grandfather
          killed people. They couldn't help
          themselves. If I stay here, I
          won't be able to control myself.
          (off her look)
          I have to be alone.
          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The
          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.

                         PETER
          We could take him to the river.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want him ever found.

                         PETER
          We'll weight him with rocks.

                         ISABELLE
          No. We'll put the rocks inside
          him.
          (off his look)
          Cut him open. I will sew the
          rocks inside him.
          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next
          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes
          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter
          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder
          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...

                         CONTINUED:
          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's
          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.
          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.

          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT

          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame
          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs
          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.
          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a
          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in
          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove
          off, but Isabelle stops him:

                         ISABELLE
          Wait.
          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his
          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting
          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them
          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.
          Peter gives her a questioning look.

                         ISABELLE
          These belonged to my grandmother.
          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he
          does... something begins to shine through in the
          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.

                         PETER
          They're silver.

          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.
          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in
          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...
          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the
          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.

                         PETER
          Death was too good for him.

                         ISABELLE
          I can live with it.

          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and
          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last
          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.

                         ISABELLE
          Where will you go?

                         PETER
          I don't know. I need to
          understand what I've become.
          Maybe I can learn to control it.
          (off her look)
          I'll take my own life before I
          take another's.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.

                         PETER
          I'm not coming back. I don't want
          you to wait for me. This is the
          last time you'll ever see me.

                         ISABELLE
          No, it isn't. You'll be in my
          dreams until the day I die.
          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.

                         PETER
          You know, Henri is a good man.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, he is.
          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)

          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with
          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers
          bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Life in my village was changed

          that was answer enough for most.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're
          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and
          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Henri and I were married. He was
          a good man and a good father. I
          loved him very much. But I never
          loved him the same way that I
          loved Peter. That was the one
          secret in our marriage.

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing
          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.
          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I only tell you now because he is
          dead. And if he knows now, I
          believe that he forgives me, for
          he must also know that I never
          loved him falsely.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,
          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed
          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          This is my story, not that I
          expect you will believe it. In my
          own village, the events of that
          awful winter have already passed
          into legend. Parents tell their
          children to be good or else the
          Wolf will come and gobble them up.
          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          They've already forgotten. A
          simple children's story is all
          that remains.

          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But I often wonder if I hear him.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD

          1 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 1

          Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:

          KIM PINE (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

          2 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 2

          Four twenty-somethings lounge around a small kitchen table.
          STEPHEN STILLS, 25, shaggy hair, Canadian Cowboy chic.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Really? Is she hot?
          KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper.

                         KIM PINE
          How old are you now, Scott? Like
          twenty-eight?

                         SCOTT
          I'm not playing your little games.

                         KIM PINE
          So you've been out of high school
          for like, 13 years and-

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two!

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          And you're dating a high school
          girl? Not bad, not bad.
          YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Like, did you guys 'do it' yet?
          SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an
          unruly yet adorable mop of hair.

                         SCOTT
          We have done many things. We ride
          the bus. We have meaningful
          conversations about how yearbook
          club went and about her friends
          and, um...you know...drama.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?

          Well. Aren't you pleased as punch?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          So, what's her name?

                         SCOTT
          (pleased as punch)
          Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          (under his breath)
          Chinese...
          Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Wicked! How'd you meet her?

                         SCOTT
          I believe I mentioned the bus?
          Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

          3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

          KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match,
          sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You are seventeen year old! Time to
          get interested in boy!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Mom!
          Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You drop book.
          Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey...
          Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM
          holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

          "SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME."
          Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott
          winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

          Back in the kitchen, everyone looks at Scott...

          Is that seriously the end of the story?

          Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          So when do we get to meet her?

                         KIM PINE
          Oh please. Let it be soon.
          DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly.

                         SCOTT
          That's for me.

          5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5

          An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

                         SCOTT
          You promise to be good?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Of course I'll be good!

                         SCOTT
          No, really. Please be good.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Am I normally not?
          Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
          Stills. He's the talent.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey.
          STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Is she gonna geek out on us?

                         SCOTT
          She'll just sit in the corner, man.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          I mean, I want her to geek out on us.

                         SCOTT
          She'll geek. She geeks. She has the
          capacity to geek.

          Knives enters, looking around the rehearsal pad with awe:
          Bare bulb, ratty rug, drums, guitar, bass, LAME BRAND amps.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Wow.

                         SCOTT
          Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat.
          Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hi, sorry, what was your name?

          KIM PINE (O.S.)
          Kim.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You play the drums?
          REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands.

                         KIM PINE
          ...yes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          That is so awesome.

                         SCOTT
          Knives, that's Young Neil.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hi. What do you play?

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's
          kind of a big question.
          Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Oh. I'm not in the band. I just
          live here.
          Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.

          TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space
          seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks
          unintelligable lyrics.
          Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You guys...are so...amazing.

          Scott bids adieu to a stunned Knives as she gets on a bus.

          9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

          Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He
          turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

          "WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

          Before you hear some dirty lies
          from someone else, yes, I'm dating
          a 17 year old.
          Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

                         WALLACE
          Is he cute?

          Seventeen years old? Scandal!
          Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on

          Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

                         SCOTT
          Wallace!
          Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

                         STACEY
          Who is this mysterious child you date?

                         SCOTT
          Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

                         STACEY
          A seventeen year old Chinese
          schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

                         SCOTT
          It's a Catholic school too.

                         STACEY
          With the uniform and everything?

          Yeah, the whole deal.

                         STACEY
          Oh my God, you haven't-

                         SCOTT
          No no no. We haven't even held
          hands. I think she hugged me once.

                         STACEY
          Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

                         SCOTT
          I don't know...it's just nice, you
          know? It's just...simple.

                         STACEY
          It's been over a year since you got
          dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named.
          Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,
          looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

          STACEY (CONT'D)
          So, are you legitimately moving on,
          or is this just you being insane?
          Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next
          to a hot redhead in happier times.

                         SCOTT
          Can I get back to you on that?
          A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

          10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

          Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
          Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

                         WALLACE
          I do not want to be here. At all.

                         SCOTT
          This school has boys too.

                         WALLACE
          I hate you. Even I would think twice
          about dating a seventeen year old.

                         SCOTT
          Well, she's only allowed out when
          the sun is up, so I wouldn't call
          it dating, more like...

          Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.

                         SCOTT
          Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
          roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
          my class is gay?

                         WALLACE
          Yes. Does he wear glasses?

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, you go now! Begone!
          Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.

                         WALLACE
          You're too good for him. Run.

          11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

          Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
          arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
          They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

                         SCOTT
          Did you know the original name of Pac-
          man was Puck-man? You would think it's
          because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
          which means to flap ones mouth open
          and closed. They changed it over here
          because Puck-Man is too easy to
          vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
          and turn it into an F or whatever?
          Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Ohmigod, like...wow.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. Wow.
          The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8...
          Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.

          Scott and Knives leave a pizza joint, slices in hand.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Tamara is into this Korean guy,
          Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby
          has a crush on Mina.

                         SCOTT
          I thought Derek and Tamara had a
          mutual like-each-other thing going,
          what happened?

          A13 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY A13

          Scott and Knives shop for T-shirts. Hangers click in time.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I don't listen to much music. I
          know a lot of kids who play piano
          or whatever, but you guys ROCK.

                         SCOTT
          I knew I personally rocked, but I
          never suspected that we rocked as a
          unit. Thank you, Knives.

          Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.

          I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.

                         SCOTT
          Well, we're already pretty big. But
          it might be cool if cool people
          wore our T-shirt.
          Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:

          I hearted them too until they signed
          to a major label and the singer turned
          into a total bitch and ruined my life.

          Uh. Let's talk about something else.
          The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He

          The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to

          I told you like fifty times!
          Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an
          icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.

                         KIM PINE
          We're going to this party, retard.

                         SCOTT
          Party?

                         YOUNG NEIL
          At Julie's.

                         SCOTT
          Ugh. I thought you guys split.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We did. But, you know, there may be
          some label guys there, so...

          Aw, man. This is going to suck.

          At least it will give us something
          to complain about.

          21 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21

          A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded
          house party. Both have red plastic cups in hand.

                         SCOTT
          ...this sucks.

          Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.

          Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone

          Scott scans the party. His eyes go WIDE. He CRUSHES his
          plastic cup. There she is...playing the wall...RAMONA! Aloof.
          Enigmatic. Hot. Scott sidles up and stands next to her.

          Well you know Pac-Man was
          originally Puckman but not because
          Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck
          and paku-paku-paku means flapping
          your mouth and they changed it
          because if you scratch out the "P"

          Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.

          I'm not getting it, friend.
          Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with
          STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.

                         STACEY
          You're thinking of juggling two chicks!?

                         SCOTT
          Not even!

                         STACEY
          Well, you should break up with your
          fake high school girlfriend.

                         SCOTT
          Wait. Who told you?

                         STACEY
          Duh. Wallace.

                         SCOTT
          He's not even conscious!

                         STACEY
          Whatever. You of all people should know
          how sucky it is to get cheated on.

                         SCOTT
          Don't you have a job to do?

                         STACEY
          You're right. I should send out a
          mass text about this. Bye.
          Scott looks to Wallace, who is out cold, cellphone in hand.

          Yearbook club is getting SO boring.

          Either that or you need to start
          hanging out with me.

                         RAMONA
          You want me to hang out with you?

                         SCOTT
          Um...you know...if that's cool.

                         RAMONA
          If I say yes, will you sign for
          your damn package?
          Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the
          package straight in the trash.

                         SCOTT
          Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?

          Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the
          park. The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them.

                         SCOTT
          Why are you just standing there?

                         RAMONA
          Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry, I just assumed you were too
          cool to be on time.

                         RAMONA
          Well. You assumed wrong.

                         SCOTT
          So what do you want to do? We could

          I'm cool with whatever you want to do.

          This is good.
          Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.

                         SCOTT
          This is good. So how'd you end up in
          Toronto?

                         RAMONA
          Just needed to escape I guess.

                         SCOTT
          Oh yeah?

                         RAMONA
          I got this job here. And Gideon had
          always said Toronto was one of the
          great cities so...

          They sit on some swings in the park.

          So what about you? What do you do?

          Is that why you left New York?

          Pretty much. It was time to head

          Well, it's certainly chilled here.

          Uh. Chilled as in cold.

          I'm totally obsessed with you.

                         RAMONA
          I didn't mean to get you obsessed.

                         SCOTT
          I just haven't been obsessed with a
          girl for a long time. It's weird.

                         RAMONA
          That's probably because you sleep
          with a guy.

          Actually... no... Wallace is pretty

          Dude, relax. I believe you. You're

          I'm... mostly stupid.

          Scott shivers at the kitchen table of Ramona's cozy, girl
          friendly apartment. He watches as she slips out of her coat.

                         RAMONA
          What kind of tea do you want?

                         SCOTT
          There's more than one kind?

                         RAMONA
          We have blueberry, raspberry,
          ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green
          tea with lemon, green tea with lemon
          and honey, liver disaster, ginger
          with honey, ginger without honey,
          vanilla almond, white truffle,
          blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut,
          constant comment and earl grey.

                         SCOTT
          Did you make some of those up?

          I think I'll have sleepytime.

                         SCOTT
          That sounds good to me.

          He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he

          revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes
          his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-

          Excuse my brother. He's chronically
          enfeebled. I'm Stacey.

                         RAMONA
          Hey.

                         STACEY
          And this is Wallace, his room-mate.

                         WALLACE
          Hey.

                         STACEY
          And this is my boyfriend Jimmy.

                         WALLACE

          Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.

                         SCOTT

          HEYYYYYYYY!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hey.
          Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives
          looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you like?

                         SCOTT
          I...uh...
          LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives
          and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Have. To. Go.
          Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.

          PROMOTER (O.S)
          This next band are from Brampton
          and they are Crash And The Boys.

          39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

          Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping
          through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          This is a nightmare. Is this a
          nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.

                         KIM
          Once we're on stage you'll be fine.

                         STILLS
          We were just on stage. For sound
          check. The sound guy hated us.

                         SCOTT
          It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters.
          People love us. Right?
          Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and
          Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

          Crash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy.

          Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?

                         JIMMY
          They...haven't started playing yet.

                         WALLACE
          That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.

                         CRASH
          Good evening. I am Crash, and these
          are the Boys.

                         WALLACE

          IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO?

                         CRASH
          Yes.
          TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger.

          little something like this.
          Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds.

                         CRASH
          Thank you.
          Wallace yells from the balcony.

                         WALLACE

          IT'S NOT A RACE, GUYS!

                         CRASH
          This song is for the guy who keeps

          Stills paces backstage as the others watch the band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          How are we supposed to follow this?
          We're not going to win, we're not

          As Crash And The Boys climax, Stacey turns to Ramona.

          So, how do you know Scott?

                         RAMONA
          He's...um. He's a friend.

                         STACEY
          Hard for me to keep track
          sometimes. He has so many friends.
          Ramona arches an eyebrow. Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara.

          Knives freezes, staring at the stage.

          This next band is from Toronto
          and...yeah. So give it up for

          Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a

          MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a
          lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that
          borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew
          Patel. Consider our fight...begun!

          Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

                         SCOTT
          What do I do?!

                         WALLACE

          FIGHT!
          Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his
          left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right.
          Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Alright. Alright.

                         WALLACE

          Thank you, Wallace!
          Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
          sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
          hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

                         SCOTT

          You will pay for your insolence!
          Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and
          counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott
          jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.

          Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
          puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          You really went out with this guy?

          Yeah, in the seventh grade.
          The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the

          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          If you want to fight me, you're not
          the brightest. You won't know
          what's hit you in the slightest.
          Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with
          fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Me and my fireballs and my Demon
          Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the
          talk because I know I'm slick.
          Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott.
          He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Fireball Girls! Take this sucker
          down.
          The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott
          dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Let us show him what we're all
          about.
          Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs.
          They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.

                         SCOTT
          That doesn't even rhyme.
          Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and
          throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the
          eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          This is impossible, how can it be?!
          Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time
          to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.

          K.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS. They
          clatter to the stage floor. Scott lands and picks them up.

                         SCOTT
          Sweet. Coins.

          Gay friends?
          Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out.

                         STACEY
          WALLACE?! Not again!
          Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.

          49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49

          Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.

                         SCOTT
          Aw man. $2.40? That's not even
          enough for the bus home.

                         RAMONA
          I'll lend you the 30 cents.
          Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.

          Yeah...so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins.

          50 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 50

          Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony.
          Her eyes scan the venue for Scott...but he is long gone.

                         SCOTT
          Sooooooo...
          A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.

          What was all that all about?

                         RAMONA

          Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          If we're going to date, you may
          have to defeat my seven evil ex's.

          A bleary Wallace fries bacon. Scott bursts through the front
          door, a spring in his step. The studio audience applauds.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's happy.

                         SCOTT
          Well, someone got to second base
          last night. And someone has a
          second date tonight.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's lucky then.

                         SCOTT
          You know when I say 'someone', I mean
          me, right? I got to second base last
          night...maybe first and a half.
          Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for
          dinner, so you can't be here tonight.
          I don't want you gaying up the place.

                         WALLACE
          Okay, Scott. But in return I have
          to issue an ultimatum.

                         SCOTT
          One of your famous ultimatums?

                         WALLACE
          It may live in infamy...You have to
          break up with Knives. Today. Okay?
          Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.

                         SCOTT
          But...but...it's HARD.

                         WALLACE
          If you don't do it, I'm going to
          tell Ramona about Knives. I swear
          to God, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          But you...you're...
          At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and
          helps himself to coffee.

          Morning.
          Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly.

          DOUBLE STANDARD!

                         WALLACE
          I didn't make up the gay rulebook.
          If you have a problem with it, take
          it up with Liberace's Ghost.

                         SCOTT
          You're a monster.

                         WALLACE
          Now put the bacon down and go do
          your dirt while I watch the Lucas
          Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.

          see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.

          LUCAS LEE (ON TV)
          Listen close and listen hard,

          The SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store.
          Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH
          AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS
          posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I can't believe they're coming to
          town. Will you take me to the show?

          Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you
          over for dinner.

          It's my birthday dinner.

                         SCOTT
          Uh...I think that's a really bad

          (to Sex Bob-Omb)

          Believe it or not, I actually dated
          Scott in high school.

          Got any embarassing stories?

                         KIM PINE
          Yeah. He's an idiot.
          Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again.

                         SCOTT
          Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Uh, what about rehearsal?

          58 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 58

          Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries
          around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

                         WALLACE
          Are you doing okay there?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.
          Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.

                         SCOTT
          She changed her hair.

          I know, but she changed it without
          even making a big deal about it.
          She's spontaneous. Impulsive.
          Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?

                         WALLACE
          I can't believe you were worried
          about me gaying up the place.
          Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.

                         RAMONA
          How's dinner coming along?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.

                         WALLACE
          I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm
          heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my
          hetero crush.
          Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.

                         SCOTT
          Don't go.

                         WALLACE
          Will you man the hell up? You could
          get to 2nd and a half base.

                         SCOTT
          You think so?

                         WALLACE
          Well, if you strike out in the next
          hour, come find me at the Castle.

          Okay, 'when'. See you in sixty.

          '15 MINUTES LATER'
          Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has
          cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner.

                         RAMONA
          This is actually really good garlic bread.

          Garlic bread is my favorite food. I
          could honestly eat it for every
          meal. Or just all the time without
          even stopping.

                         RAMONA
          You'd get fat.

                         SCOTT
          No. Why would I get fat?

                         RAMONA
          Bread makes you fat.

                         SCOTT

          '15 MINUTES LATER'
          A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.

                         SCOTT
          So I wrote a song about you.

                         RAMONA
          Oh yeah?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.

                         RAMONA
          I can't wait to hear it when it's
          finished.

          Finished?

          Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she
          runs her hands through his hair.

                         RAMONA
          Your hair's pretty shaggy.

                         SCOTT

          OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!?
          Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback.

          Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I
          got... I got a bad haircut right
          before me and my big ex broke up. But
          it's so long ago, I can barely
          remember it...
          A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

                         NARRATOR
          Scott is acutely aware that his last
          salon haircut took place exactly 431
          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own
          hair ever since.

                         RAMONA
          Sounds like a bad time.

                         SCOTT
          Not really.

                         NARRATOR
          It was.

                         SCOTT
          It was a mutual thing.

                         NARRATOR
          It wasn't.

                         SCOTT
          I mean, she told me it was mutual.

                         NARRATOR
          She dumped him. It was brutal.

                         RAMONA
          What was her name?

                         SCOTT
          She was Nat when I knew her. But
          she stopped liking that name.
          Then...she stopped liking me...

                         RAMONA
          Your hair is cute. I like it long.

                         SCOTT
          But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?!
          Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing
          his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.

                         RAMONA

          Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them.

                         RAMONA
          Tell me we didn't come out here
          just so you could cover your hair
          with that hat.

                         SCOTT
          Nooo. I just love me some walking.
          Putting one leg in front of the other.

                         RAMONA
          You seem a little...heightened.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
          with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
          that I do drugs, unless you do, in
          which case I do drugs all the time,
          every drug, but...you make me feel...I
          don't know. Things seem a little
          brighter around you or something.
          Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
          NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

          He just followed me around. He was

          over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.

          Think you stand a chance against an
          A-lister, bro?
          Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down
          ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Some competish you are.
          Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
          Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

          LUCAS LEE (O.S.)
          Looks like you're seeing double.
          Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.
          POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

                         LUCAS LEE
          He's good, right? Sometimes I let
          him do wide shots if I feel like
          getting blazed back in my winnie.
          Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
          STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
          dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm nothing without my stunt team.
          The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
          through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

                         WALLACE
          Ask them how it feels to always get
          his sloppy seconds!

                         SCOTT
          How does it feel to-
          KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
          barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm gonna get coffee. You homies
          want anything?
          We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear
          the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.

          SCOTT (O.S.)

          Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D
          SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.

                         SCOTT
          You're needed back on set.
          Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas
          GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!
          Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.
          Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath
          of the League of Evil Exes!

          Really?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer.
          Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets
          him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

                         SCOTT
          You are a pretty good actor.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm going for the Oscar this year.

          Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.

                         SCOTT
          So you can sell them, but can you
          do a thingy on that rail?
          Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          It's called a grind, bro.

                         SCOTT
          So can you do a grind thingy now?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Are you serious? There's like 200
          steps and the rails are garbage.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, if it's too hardcore...

                         LUCAS LEE
          You really think you can goad me

          There's girls watching.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Somebody get me my board.
          Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard.

          Why wouldn't you be?
          CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail.
          Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight,
          sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
          Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

          Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace
          cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING
          MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA

          Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it.

          Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying
          to trick you or anything. Look, if
          she's really the girl of your
          dreams, then you have to let her
          know. You have to overcome any and
          all obstacles that lie in your
          path. You have the spirit of a
          warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be

                         (BEAT)
          Plus, I need you to move out.
          Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell.

          SHFFF - SOMETHING sweeps him off his feet. He's pissed now.

                         SCOTT
          I'm really not in the mood.
          SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Okay, enough!
          Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A
          DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up
          lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.

                         MYSTERY ATTACKER
          You punched me in the boob. Prepare
          to die, obviously.

                         SCOTT
          Listen, I've had it today. Can we

          Okay little chicken, then I'll see
          you later. But you won't see me.
          Because I'll be deadly serious next

          Scott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned.

                         SCOTT
          Think I'll make it a decaf today.
          Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!

          go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.

                         JULIE
          What can I fucking get you?

                         SCOTT
          Is there anywhere you don't work?

          They're called 'jobs', something a
          fuckball like you wouldn't know

          Ramona out after I specifically
          told you not to fucking do that!
          (Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a

          Sorry that got a little crazy last
          night.

          Yeah. You kind of disappeared.

          Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know
          it's hard to be around me
          sometimes. I'll understand if you
          don't want to hang anymore.

                         SCOTT
          No. No, I want to hang. The whole
          evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie.

          A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig.
          Maybe you can put your history
          aside until we get through this
          thing. You know, for the band? For
          the band. For the band?

          Can't we do our own secret shows?

          All our shows are secret shows.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're doing it. G-man might be
          there! We play the next round of
          the battle Saturday. We need to get
          some buzz going. We need
          groundswell. We need stalkers.

          CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window.
          TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona.

          What would you do? If your ex was
          in a band and they wanted you to
          open for them?

          It might be a little awkward. But
          maybe it's the grown up thing to do.

          She's probably like 25! She's just

          She's got a head start! I didn't
          even know there WAS good music

          I mean, he knew I was cool but he
          thought I was too young, so he
          tried to find someone cool but old.

          She's cool? I thought she was fat-

          Why?
          Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It MUST be her fault. Obviously
          it's just a twist of fate or

          A huge line of TOO COOL YOUTHS snakes outside a rock venue. A

          Wallace and Other Scott clap and cheer, drunk. The other

          "KNIVES CHAU, 17, SINGLE WHITE ASIAN" with identical hair,
          clothes and makeup, standing next to Ramona, looking hot.

          Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like
          nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.

                         JULIE
          So, are you guys doing anything fun
          while you're in town?

          FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!
          Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd.
          Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN
          THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's
          hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK.

          Todd telekinetically HURLS Scott through the club's wall!
          Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in
          the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries
          to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain.

                         SCOTT
          No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

                         SCOTT
          Ovo what?

                         TODD INGRAM
          I partake not in the meat nor
          breastmilk or ovum of any creature
          that has a face.

          Short answer: Being vegan just
          makes you better than most people.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Bingo.
          Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into
          the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey man, question. I always
          wondered, how does not eating dairy
          products give you psychic powers?

                         TODD INGRAM
          You know how you only use ten
          percent of your brain? Well, it's
          because the other 90% is filled up
          with curds and whey.

          you knew the science, maybe I'd
          listen to a word you're saying.
          Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While
          the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

          backstory that can help me out in a
          critical moment of not dying? Yes.
          A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          I was only dating Lucas until the
          minute Todd walked by. I guess
          that's not very nice, but I used to
          be kind of...like that.
          Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making
          out with Young Todd.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          We hated everyone. We wrecked
          stuff. Nobody cared.
          Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          He punched a hole in the moon for
          me. It was pretty crazy.
          Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          A week and a half later, he told me
          his Dad was sending him to the
          Vegan Academy, so I dumped him.
          Does that help you at all?
          The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

                         SCOTT
          Have you dumped everyone you've
          ever been with? You've never been
          the dumpee?
          Ramona shrugs.

                         RAMONA
          Look, I've dabbled with being a
          bitch. It's part of the reason I
          moved here. I was really hoping to
          put it all behind me.

          SCOTT stands in an elephant's graveyard of plastic cups and
          bottles, picking the hell out of his bass, amp pegged to 10.
          TODD INGRAM levitates, floating towards Scott with his bass.

          Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall.
          Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him.

                         TODD INGRAM
          That's right, Pilgrim. I actually
          know how to play bass.

          I can read your thoughts. Your bass
          hand is badly injured. You're through.

                         RAMONA
          Are you okay?

                         SCOTT
          Uh huh.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Do I look like I'm not okay?
          Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're still going to the after show
          right?

                         KIM PINE
          I'm not sure it's gonna be much of
          a party, I think a third of the
          band just went 'poom'.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Cool bands never go to their own
          after parties. It's just the
          desperate people trying to rub
          elbows with label guys.

                         KIM PINE
          Then why would we...oh.

                         STEPHEN STILLS

          Neil is at the counter with a catatonic Knives. He shrugs.

          Scott? You're in right?

                         RAMONA
          Do you want to go?

                         SCOTT
          I kind of almost died back there, so...

                         RAMONA
          I'm not saying I want to go.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, we can totally go.

                         RAMONA
          I'll do whatever you want to do.

                         SCOTT
          So let's go.
          Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Are Scott and Ramona fighting?

                         WALLACE
          Not to my knowledge.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Oh.

                         WALLACE
          I mean, not with fists.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Oh.

                         WALLACE
          Yet.

          Ooh.

          81 EXT. AFTER PARTY - NIGHT 81

          The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit,
          lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.

                         RAMONA
          We really don't have to go to this
          thing. It'll probably be a bad
          scene all around and we've already
          had a full night.

          Well, not that fighting harder and
          harder battles for your love is
          getting old or anything...but have
          you ever dated someone who wasn't a
          total ass?

                         RAMONA
          So far you're not a total ass.

                         SCOTT
          But I'm part ass?

                         RAMONA
          If it makes you feel better, you're
          the nicest guy I've dated.

          Wait...is that good?

          It's what I need right now.

                         RAMONA
          Scott, I don't have all the
          answers. I'd just like to live in
          the moment if I can.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, I'd just like to live.
          Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.

          Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But
          are you saying Envy wasn't? We all
          have baggage.

                         SCOTT
          My baggage doesn't try and kill me
          every five minutes. What did you do
          to your ex-boyfriends to make them
          so insane?

          No break up is painless. Someone
          always gets hurt. What about you
          and that girl Knives?

                         SCOTT
          Knives?

                         RAMONA
          Who broke up with who?

                         SCOTT
          I believe...I broke up with her.

                         RAMONA
          And was she cool with that?

                         SCOTT
          Knives is with Young Neil now,
          she's totally cool with it.
          They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no
          interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. She's very mature for her
          age. It was a very healthy break
          up. We're all peaches and gravy.
          We hear an offscreen distant 'nooooo' from Knives.

                         RAMONA
          And what about you and Kim?
          They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.

                         SCOTT
          Me and Kim? I can barely remember.
          Why, is it important?

                         RAMONA
          Hey, you want to know everything
          about my past, dude.

                         SCOTT
          It was just...yeah. I don't know.
          It was high school. She had
          freckles. It was cool, I guess.

                         RAMONA
          That's it?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.

          Scott and Ramona have reached the bar at the party.

                         RAMONA
          That's really the whole story?

                         SCOTT
          OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get
          with her! I fought a crazy eighty
          foot tall purple suited dude! And I
          had to fight 96 guys to get to him,
          too! He was flying and shooting
          lightning bolts from his eyes! He
          was totally awesome and I kicked
          him so far he saw the curvature of
          the earth! Does that make you feel
          any better?

                         RAMONA
          Well now you are being a total ass.
          Welcome to the club.
          In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection:
          fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry. I'm not usually like this.

                         RAMONA
          Hey, don't worry. I don't know what
          I'm like anymore.

                         SCOTT
          I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing
          is really messing with my head.

          Why do you keep saying-
          PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the
          head, sending him flying across the dance floor.
          Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          It meant nothing???

                         RAMONA
          I was just a little bi-curious.

          Well honey, I'm a little bi-furious!
          Roxy throws a SCORPION KICK at Scott's face. Ramona CATCHES
          her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold.

                         RAMONA
          Do that again and I will end you.

          RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona
          CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES
          into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere.
          PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It
          smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out.
          Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt
          SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt
          wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.

          towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and
          SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!

                         RAMONA
          Her weak point's the back of her knees!

                         SCOTT
          What? How does that work?

                         RAMONA
          Whenever we were making out, I-

                         SCOTT
          Okay.
          As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
          lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

          GRAPHIC: 'TICKLE TICKLE!'

                         ROXY
          Oh...
          Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic
          meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          You'll...never...be able to do this
          to herrrrrrrrrrr!
          Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent
          Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.

           Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona
           follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them.

                          RAMONA
           Sooooo...

                          SCOTT
          Two gin and tonics please.

                         RAMONA
          I thought you didn't drink.

                         SCOTT
          Only on special occasions. Why? Did
          you want one?
          Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.

                         RAMONA
          I guess we really don't know that
          much about each other do we?
          Scott seems immediately drunk.

                         SCOTT
          Maybe you could just give me a list
          of all your exes so at least I know
          who's going to beat my ass into the
          ground next.

                         RAMONA
          Oh, like a handy little laminate or
          something? Let me see if I can find one.
          (looks through bag)
          Maybe we could exchange our information.
          Scott has already downed his second drink.

                         SCOTT
          Just out of sheer curiosity and
          concern for my mortal well-being,
          is there anyone at this party you
          haven't slept with?

          EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY

          HEY!
          Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.

                         RAMONA
          I really think we should split.

                         SCOTT
          As in 'get out of here'? Or as in
          'split split'?

          How could I not? I feel like we just
          washed our sexy laundry in public.

                         RAMONA
          Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

                         SCOTT
          (holds up 2 fingers)
          I've had like one drink.

                         RAMONA
          Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't
          enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm
          sick of it. I thought you might be
          more understanding.

                         SCOTT

                         I JUST-

                         RAMONA
          You're just another evil ex-
          boyfriend waiting to happen.
          Ramona walks off and loudly announces.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          And yes, there is someone at this
          party I haven't slept with. You.
          Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the
          room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party.
          But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          P.S. Here's your stupid list.
          Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-

          'PATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'

                         SCOTT
          Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          You don't know?

          83 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - NIGHT 83

          Stills flips to hand drawn sketches of THE KATAYANAGIS,
          identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          They're the next band in the battle
          and they are badass.

          We reveal a grim, terse Scott playing a doomy bassline. The
          rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona.

                         KIM PINE
          Ramona dated twins?

                         SCOTT
          Apparently.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          At the same time?

                         SCOTT
          You know what? I don't know and I
          don't want to know.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Good. You know how I feel about
          girls cockblocking the rock.

                         SCOTT
          Good. I play better in a bad mood.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          If it's gonna be an issue though,
          Young Neil can fill in for you.

                         SCOTT
          It's not an issue. You know bands,
          I know battles. We got it covered.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, we'd understand if you didn't
          want to take part.

                         SCOTT
          Not only do I want to take part. I
          want to take them apart.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Okay. I'm getting tingles.

          Sex Bob-Omb and Young Neil load their gear at the venue.

          Come on. You're onstage in five.

                         SCOTT
          Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on
          first?

          That's impossible-

          85 INT. THE NINTH CIRCLE, STAGE - NIGHT 85


          'ACTUALLY, NO'
          Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a
          MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB,
          with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.

                         SCOTT
          Okay. My bad.

                         KIM PINE
          Your bad is saying my bad.
          Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind
          their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned
          between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We shouldn't even be here. We
          shouldn't even be here.
          Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.

                         SCOTT
          Come on man! I put aside my
          problems for the music. If I can do
          that, we can do anything.

                         KIM PINE
          Did you speak to Ramona then?

          hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a
          nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses.
          They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.

                         KIM PINE
          Scott? Not that I care...but you should
          talk to her before she's gone...

          Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to
          find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then-
          Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage.
          A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear,
          sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands.
          KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN
          KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese.

          Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean,
          we can do this. Right?

          Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting
          an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that
          it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the
          ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

          AUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.)
          They brought the house down.
          Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth

          towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome.
          Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up
          to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform
          the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!
          Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from
          the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS
          SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers.
          Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.

          Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers
          in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

                         SCOTT
          That's Gideon?
          Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He
          struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as
          Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

          That...was epic.
          The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears,
          hovering next to Scott.
          Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are
          gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott. What are you doing?

                         SCOTT
          Getting a life.
          Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-
          applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES
          standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I just came to see the show. I'm
          not even stalking you.
          Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

                         SCOTT
          You seem... different.
          Knives shrugs, different.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I feel like I know stuff now.
          Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of
          GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

                         SCOTT
          Ramona...
          Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

          Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.

          Great. Listen, I know you just play
          mysterious and aloof to avoid
          getting hurt. I know you have
          reasons for not wanting to talk

          A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

                         RAMONA
          It's Gideon. I just...I can't help

          That's the bad news.
          GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
          tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          The good news, Scottie, is I'm
          officially loving the Sex Bombs.

          I'm signing you right now for a three

          Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.

          You think we're gonna sell our
          souls to you? Well then guess-
          We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
          furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
          it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
          with this douche-in-charge.

          Scottie, buddy, can I just say,
          keep your emotions in check. Don't
          let what's past screw up your
          future.
          Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
          mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          The people need to hear us, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Then you're going to need to find
          someone else to play bass.
          A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

                         GIDEON
          Looks like we're all set.
          Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
          round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

                         GIDEON
          Oh and Scott, we should really be
          thanking each other. I mean, if it
          wasn't for me, you would have never
          been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
          for you, she wouldn't be back with
          me. So I guess it all shakes out.
          Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

                         GIDEON
          And hey, the whole League of Evil
          Exes thing? I was in a dark place

          Password?
          Scott shrugs.

                         SCOTT
          Whatever.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           INTEGRATED FINAL 104A.

          93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93

          The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
          GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Second password?
          Scott gives the slightest shrug.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.

          94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94

          Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
          LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.
          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
          snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
          Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so much
          better than their first album.
          Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
          playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott!
          Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

          STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)
          Let it go. Don't give him the
          satisfaction.

                         SCOTT
          What if I want the satisfaction?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, then you're doomed.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
          BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
          Theatre. Somebody get this man a
          drink! Coke Zero right?
          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.
          Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

                         SCOTT
          I'm not here to drink.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I got no beef with you.

                         SCOTT
          You mean 'The League'?

                         GIDEON
          Guild, League, whatever. It's
          ancient history.
          Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          I'll show you how ancient of
          history it is.
          Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          No use crying over spilt Coke,
          buddy. The lady made her choice and
          we're all gonna have to move on.

                         SCOTT
          Well I ain't moving...buddy.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?

                         SCOTT
          Was that not clear?
          (to Sex Bob-Omb)
          Was that not clear?
          Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Now why on earth do you want to do that?

                         SCOTT
          Because, I'm in love with her.
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
          reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

          NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Scott earned the power of love...
          Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I think this deserves a song.

          We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to
          make money, and sell out and stuff.
          Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

          A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT.
          Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes
          at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS.
          Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle.
          He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there.
          Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends
          like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands.
          Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

                         SCOTT
          Your club sucks, by the way.
          Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

                         GIDEON
          If my cathedral of cutting edge
          taste holds no interest for your
          tragically Canadian sensibilities,
          then I shall grant you a swift exit
          from the premises. And fast
          entrance into HELLLLLLL.
          Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

          KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

          SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!
          KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of
          Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling
          down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          That is priceless.
          Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly
          recovers and POINTS a furious finger.

          Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights
          defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

          You can't say I don't know how to
          put on a show.
          GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's
          tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

                         RAMONA

          the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives
          to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

          Alright... the truth is, it was me

          ...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I

          HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN!

          SOME GUY (O.S.)
          Again?

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Turn off the light!
          Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, when my journey began, I
          was living in an ordinary world.
          Ramona skated through my dreams and
          it was like a call to adventure, a
          call I considered refusing. But my
          Mentor, that's you, told me if I
          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were
          tests, allies, enemies. I
          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.
          Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
          Now I realize what I should have
          been fighting for all along. But
          before I do that, I need to ask one
          final favor of you.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Sure thing, guy.

                         SCOTT
          Could you put a robe on and hand me
          the phone?
          Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.

          Scott. I was just about to-

                         SCOTT
          Hey, pal. I feel terrible about
          everything. I don't want any hard
          feelings, so I figure why not be
          the bigger man and give you a call.

          Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same
          HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.

                         SCOTT

          Neil? You have learned well. From

          Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.

          Scott turns to GIDEON on his throne, Ramona at his side.

          GIDEON GRAVES (CONT'D)
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-

                         SCOTT
          Save it. You're pretentious, the club
          sucks, I have beef, let's do it.
          Scott goes straight into fight mode.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes
          Scott, different than before.

                         SCOTT
          No...I want to fight you for me.
          Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.

          FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon his cane. He unsheathes his SWORD. Scott
          and Gideon RUN towards each other, LEAPING in the air. They
          pass in the air and Scott SLASHES. They land on opposite
          sides of the platform, backs to each other.

                         SCOTT

          Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head
          SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK.
          They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel.
          Scott jumps between them, hands held out.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          ENOUGH!
          Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She
          kicks him in the face.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and
          I will have my revenge!

          No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated
          on you.
          Knives steps back, stunned.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You cheated on me Scott?

                         SCOTT
          I cheated on both of you. And I'm
          sorry. I was a different guy back
          then.
          Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.

          And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't
          mean that. So, are we all good?
          Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks.

          Never felt better.

          and learning? I thought we had a

          All turn to see GIDEON; bloodied, but still grinning, a
          lopsided slash across his face accentuating his smirk.

          Wrong move, baby.
          Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
          with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
          hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.
          Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
          deflects them, SHING SHING!
          Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
          looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Yeah. You're still my girl.
          Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear.

          Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.
          Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
          scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.
          Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

          FREEZE FRAMES.
          Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
          PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.
          Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
          assault and grins.

                         GIDEON
          You made me swallow me gum. That's
          going to be in my digestive tract
          for seven years!
          Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'X' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks
          with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps
          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott

          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of

          The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

          GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You can defeat me...but can you
          defeat...yourself?
          Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
          MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
          Scott whips around to face...

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Negascott!
          NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
          hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
          Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

                         SCOTT
          No. This is something I have to
          face on my own.
          The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
          to confront his dark side.
          Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

          100-103 OMITTED 100-103

          104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

          Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
          They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
          Then...
          Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
          hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          What happened?

                         SCOTT
          Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
          He's a super-nice guy. We actually
          have a lot in common.
          Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Your hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It's getting really shaggy.
          Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I like it.
          Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
          his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

                         SCOTT
          You do?
          Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
          her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
          Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... Where are you going?
          Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

                         RAMONA
          I dunno. I should probably
          disappear.

                         SCOTT
          After all that?

                         RAMONA
          It's hard, you know? I came here to
          get away, but the past keeps
          catching up. I'm tired of people
          getting hurt because of me.
          Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

                         SCOTT
          I think I understand.
          Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

                         RAMONA
          I should tahnk you, though.

                         SCOTT
          For what?

                         RAMONA
          For being the nicest guy I ever
          dated.

                         SCOTT
          That's kind of sad.

                         RAMONA

                         (ALMOST LAUGHING)
          It is kind of sad.
          She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

                         RAMONA
          Well... Bye and stuff.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. And stuff.
          She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

          KNIVES (O.S.)
          Go get her.
          Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Wha?

                         KNIVES
          You earned it. You've been fighting
          for her all along.

                         SCOTT
          But what about you?

                         KNIVES
          (totally sweet and sad)
          I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
          anyway.
          She grins and kisses his cheek.

                         KNIVES
          There's someone out there for me.
          We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
          Guitar still in hand.
          We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
          Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

                         KNIVES
          Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey... mind if I tag along?

                         (CONTINUED)

          Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

                         RAMONA
          You want to come with me?

                         SCOTT

                         (HOPEFUL)
          I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.

          JULIE (V.O.)
          Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.

          STACEY (V.O.)
          Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.

The Seventh Seal
 
The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of
wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are 
wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. 

Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he 
collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His 
open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles 
towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.

The KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his 
sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the 
darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on 
his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning 
against the grime. 

The KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed 
and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched 
together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He 
opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from 
the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a 
dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, 
barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and 
restless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius 
Block turns around.

Behind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his 
hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. 

				KNIGHT 
		Who are you? 

				DEATH 
		I am Death.

				KNIGHT 
		Have you come for me?

				DEATH 
		I have been walking by your side for a long 
		time. 

				KNIGHT 
		That I know. 

				DEATH 
		Are you prepared?

				KNIGHT
		My body is frightened, but I am not. 

				DEATH 
		Well, there is no shame in that.

The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place 
it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. 

				KNIGHT 
		Wait a moment.

				DEATH 
		That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. 

				KNIGHT 
		You play chess, don't you?

A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. 

				DEATH 
		How did you know that?

				KNIGHT 
		I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung 
		in ballads.

				DEATH 
		Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. 

				KNIGHT 
		But you can't be better than I am.

The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes 
out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins 
setting up the pieces.

				DEATH 
		Why do you want to play chess with me? 

				KNIGHT 
		I have my reasons. 

				DEATH 
		That is your privilege.

				KNIGHT 
		The condition is that I may live as long as I 
		hold out against you. If I win, you will 
		release me. Is it agreed? 

The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. 
DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn. 

				KNIGHT 
		You drew black!

				DEATH 
		Very appropriate. Don't you think so?

The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, 
Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's 
pawn.
 


The morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has 
ceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow 
whitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day 
is already scorchingly hot.

The squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he 
grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his 
horse and picks up the heavy pack.

The KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and 
up towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his 
squire. JONS soon overtakes him.

				JONS 
			(sings)
	 	Between a strumpet's legs to lie 
		Is the life for which I sigh.

He stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or 
he pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS 
sings even louder. 

				JONS 
			(sings)
		Up above is God Almighty 
		So very far away, 
		But your brother the Devil 
		You will meet on every level.

JONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his 
horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The 
long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They 
ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the 
sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.

				JONS 
		In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil 
		omens and other horrible things. Two horses had 
		eaten each other in the night, and, in the 
		churchyard, graves had been opened and the 
		remains of corpses scattered all over the 
		place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many 
		as four suns in the heavens.
 
The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling 
towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot 
sun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The 
miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, 
wagging its tail.

JONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. 
When he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake 
him awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back 
his hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. 
It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth. 

JONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin 
and hands the bag to the knight. 

				KNIGHT 
		Well, did he show you the way? 

				JONS 
		Not exactly.

				KNIGHT 
		What did he say? 

				JONS 
		Nothing.

				KNIGHT 
		Was he a mute?

				JONS 
		No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of 
		fact, he was quite eloquent. 

				KNIGHT 
		Oh?

				JONS 
		He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that 
		what he had to say was most depressing.
			(sings)
		One moment you're bright and lively, 
		The next you're crawling with worms. 
		Fate is a terrible villain 
		And you, my friend, its poor victim. 

				KNIGHT 
		Must you sing? 

				JONS 
		No.

The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a 
while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle 
down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They 
ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees 
stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby 
and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest 
under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the 
bend of the road.
 


In his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer 
from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the 
wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light 
across the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who 
are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, 
snores loudly. 

JOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big 
trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny 
old horse. 

				JOF 
		Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't 
		eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? 
		We're a little hard up. People aren't very 
		interested in juggling in this part of the 
		country.

He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he 
stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down 
with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to 
sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and 
the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long 
warble.

JOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed 
expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and 
bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.

Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, 
the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around 
grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. 

JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.

				JOF 
		Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen 
		something. I've got to tell you about it!

				MIA 
			(sits up, terrified)
		What is it? What's happened? 

				JOF 
		Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a 
		vision. It was real, absolutely real.

				MIA 
		Oh, so you've had a vision again!

MIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by 
the shoulders. 

				JOF 
		But I did see her! 

				MIA 
		Whom did you see? 

				JOF 
		The Virgin Mary.

MIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.

				MIA 
		Did you really see her?

				JOF 
		She was so close to me that I could have 
		touched her. She had a golden crown on her head 
		and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She 
		was barefoot and had small brown hands with 
		which she was holding the Child and teaching 
		Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her 
		and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears 
		and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. 
		And everything became so still in the sky and 
		on the earth. Can you understand ... 

				MIA 
		What an imagination you have.

				JOF 
		You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell 
		you, not the kind of reality you see every day, 
		but a different kind. 

				MIA
		Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us 
		about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon 
		wheels red, using his tail as a brush.

				JOF 
			(embarrassed)
		Why must you keep bringing that up? 

				MIA
		And then you discovered that you had red paint 
		under your nails.

				JOF 
		Well, perhaps that time I made it up. 
			(eagerly)  
		I did it just so that you would believe in my 
		other visions. The real ones. The ones that I 
		didn't make up. 

				MIA 
			(severely)
		You have to keep your visions under control.
		Otherwise people will think that you're a 
		half-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- 
		as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm 
		not so sure about that.

				JOF 
			(angry)
		I didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it 
		if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin 
		appears before me and angels and devils like my 
		company.

				SKAT 
			(sits up)
		Haven't I told you once and for all that I need 
		my morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, 
		pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm 
		telling you to shut up!

His eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he 
left off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They 
sit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms 
vigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed 
and astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.

				MIA 
		If we would only get some rain. Everything is 
		burned to cinders. We won't have anything to 
		eat this winter. 

				JOF 
			(yawning)
		We'll get by.

He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs 
contentedly.

				MIA 
		I want Mikael to have a better life than ours. 

				JOF 
		Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or 
		a juggler who can do the one impossible trick. 

				MIA 
		What's that?

				JOF 
		To make one of the balls stand absolutely still
		in the air. 

				MIA 
		But that's impossible.

				JOF 
		Impossible for us -- but not for him. 

				MIA 
		You're dreaming again.

She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.
JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.

				JOF 
		I've composed a song. I made it up during the 
		night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to 
		hear it? 

				MIA 
		Sing it. I'm very curious.
 
				JOF 
		I have to sit up first.

He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and 
sings in a loud voice. 

				JOF 
			(sings)
		On a lily branch a dove is perched 
		Against the summer sky, 
		She sings a wondrous song of Christ 
		And there's great joy on high.

He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.

				JOF 
		Mia! Are you asleep? 

				MIA 
		It's a lovely song. 

				JOF 
		I haven't finished yet.
 
				MIA 
		I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little 
		longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. 

				JOF 
		All you do is sleep.

JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also 
sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He 
yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely 
made death mask.

				SKAT 
		Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If 
		the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no 
		thank you. 

				JOF 
		Are you going to play Death?
 
				SKAT 
		Just think, scaring decent folk out of their 
		wits with this kind of nonsense.

				JOF 
		When are we supposed to do this play?

				SKAT 
		At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going 
		to perform right on the church steps, believe 
		it or not.
 
				JOF 
		Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? 
		People like it better, and, besides, it's more 
		fun.

				SKAT 
		Idiot. There's a rumor going around that 
		there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and 
		now the priests are prophesying sudden death 
		and all sorts of spiritual agonies. 

MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of 
grass and looking smilingly at her husband.
 
				JOF 
		And what part am I to play?

				SKAT 
		You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be 
		the Soul of Man.

				JOF 
		That's a bad part, of course.

				SKAT 
		Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the
		director of this company anyhow?

SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.

				SKAT 
		Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by 
		a thread. Your time is short. 
			(in his usual voice) 
		Are the women going to like me in this getup? 
		Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead 
		already.

He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. 
MIA lies beside him on the grass. 

				MIA 
		Jof!
 
				JOF 
		What is it?
 
				MIA 
		Sit still. Don't move. 

				JOF 
		What do you mean? 

				MIA 
		Don't say anything. 

				JOF 
		I'm as silent as a grave. 

				MIA 
		Shh! I love you.
 


Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The 
KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows 
him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the 
right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite 
finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and 
paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in 
his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other 
faces.

				JONS 
		What is this supposed to represent? 

				PAINTER 
		The Dance of Death. 

				JONS 
		And that one is Death?
 
				PAINTER 
		Yes, he dances off with all of them.
 
				JONS 
		Why do you paint such nonsense?

				PAINTER 
		I thought it would serve to remind people that 
		they must die.
 
				JONS 
		Well, it's not going to make them feel any 
		happier. 

				PAINTER 
		Why should one always make people happy? It 
		might not be a bad idea to scare them a little 
		once in a while.

				JONS 
		Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to 
		look at your painting.
 
				PAINTER 
		Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more 
		interesting than a naked woman.
 
				JONS 
		If you do scare them ... 

				PAINTER 
		They'll think. 

				JONS 
		And if they think ...
 
				PAINTER 
		They'll become still more scared.
 
				JONS 
		And then they'll run right into the arms of the 
		priests. 

				PAINTER 
		That's not my business.
 
				JONS 
		You're only painting your Dance of Death. 

				PAINTER 
		I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone 
		else can do as he likes.

				JONS 
		Just think how some people will curse you. 

				PAINTER 
		Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing 
		for them to look at. I have to make a living 
		-- at least until the plague takes me.
 
				JONS 
		The plague. That sounds horrible.

				PAINTER 
		You should see the boils on a diseased man's 
		throat. You should see how his body shrivels up 
		so that his legs look like knotted strings -- 
		like the man I've painted over there.

The PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in 
the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. 

				JONS 
		That looks terrible.

				PAINTER 
		It certainly does. He tries to rip out the 
		boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open 
		with his fingernails and his screams can be 
		heard everywhere. Does that scare you?
 
				JONS 
		Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the 
		horrors you've painted over there?

				PAINTER 
		The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures
		think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. 
		Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of 
		Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating 
		themselves and others, all for the glory of God.

				JONS 
		Do they really whip themselves?

				PAINTER 
		Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a 
		ditch and hide when they pass by.

				JONS 
		Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking 
		water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a 
		camel in the desert. 

				PAINTER 
		I think I frightened you after all.

JONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.



The KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.
The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony 
eyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of 
anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil 
spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the 
confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the 
grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. 

				KNIGHT 
		I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but 
		my heart is empty.

DEATH doesn't answer.
 
				KNIGHT 
		The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my 
		own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled 
		with fear and disgust. 

DEATH doesn't answer.
 
				KNIGHT 
		Through my indifference to my fellow men, I 
		have isolated myself from their company. Now I 
		live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in 
		my dreams and fantasies. 

				DEATH 
		And yet you don't want to die. 

				KNIGHT 
		Yes, I do.
 
				DEATH 
		What are you waiting for? 

				KNIGHT 
		I want knowledge. 

				DEATH 
		You want guarantees?

				KNIGHT 
		Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly 
		inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why 
		should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken 
		promises and unseen miracles? 

DEATH doesn't answer.
 
				KNIGHT 
		How can we have faith in those who believe when 
		we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going 
		to happen to those of us who want to believe 
		but aren't able to? And what is to become of 
		those who neither want to nor are capable of 
		believing?

The KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. 
There is complete silence. 

				KNIGHT 
		Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He 
		live on in this painful and humiliating way 
		even though I curse Him and want to tear Him 
		out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, 
		is He a baffling reality that I can't shake 
		off? Do you hear me? 

				DEATH 
		Yes, I hear you.

				KNIGHT 
		I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, 
		but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His 
		hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to 
		me. 

				DEATH 
		But He remains silent.
 
				KNIGHT
		I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems 
		to be there.
 
				DEATH 
		Perhaps no one is there.
 
				KNIGHT 
		Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can 
		live in the face of death, knowing that all is 
		nothingness. 

				DEATH 
		Most people never reflect about either death or 
		the futility of life.

				KNIGHT 
		But one day they will have to stand at that 
		last moment of life and look towards the 
		darkness. 

				DEATH 
		When that day comes ...
 
				KNIGHT 
		In our fear, we make an image, and that image 
		we call God.
 
				DEATH 
		You are worrying ...

				KNIGHT 
		Death visited me this morning. We are playing 
		chess together. This reprieve gives me the 
		chance to arrange an urgent matter.

				DEATH 
		What matter is that?
 
				KNIGHT 
		My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, 
		a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no 
		bitterness or self-reproach because the lives 
		of most people are very much like this. But I 
		will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. 

				DEATH 
		Is that why you are playing chess with Death? 

				KNIGHT 
		He is a clever opponent, but up to now I 
		haven't lost a single man.

				DEATH 
		How will you outwit Death in your game? 

				KNIGHT 
		I use a combination of the bishop and the 
		knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the 
		next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.

				DEATH 
		I'll remember that.

DEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but 
disappears instantly.

				KNIGHT 
		You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet 
		again, and I'll find a way.

				DEATH 
			(invisible)
		We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue 
		playing.

The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes 
through the tiny window. 

				KNIGHT 
		This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood 
		pulsing through it. The sun is still high in 
		the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing 
		chess with Death. 

He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.



Meanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly 
together.

				JONS 
		Me and my master have been abroad and have just 
		come home. Do you understand, you little 
		pictor? 

				PAINTER 
		The Crusade.

				JONS 
			(drunk)
		Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy 
		Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, 
		wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the 
		wine poison us, the women give us lice, the 
		lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the 
		Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that 
		only a real idealist could have thought it up. 
		But what you said about the plague was 
		horrible. 

				PAINTER 
		It's worse than that.

				JONS 
		Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have 
		your rump behind you. That's the truth.

				PAINTER 
		The rump behind you, the rump behind you 
		there's a profound truth.

JONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.

				JONS 
		This is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks 
		the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the 
		girls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable 
		only to himself, ridiculous to all including 
		himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no 
		interest to Hell. 

The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright 
sunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.

Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a 
woman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been 
shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet 
she doesn't appear to be fully conscious. 

JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working 
quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk 
mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and 
with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and 
around the woman. JONS holds his nose.

				JONS 
		That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What 
		is it good for?

				SOLDIER 
		She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil 
		One. 

He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky 
mess on the wall. 

				JONS 
		And now she's in the stocks.

				SOLDIER 
		She will be burned tomorrow morning at the 
		parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil 
		away from the rest of us.

				JONS 
			(holding his nose)
		And you do that with this stinking mess?

				SOLDIER 
		It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile 
		of a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the 
		smell. 

				JONS 
		Neither can I.
 
JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments 
looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes 
towards him. 

				KNIGHT 
		Have you seen the Devil?

The MONK stops reading and raises his head. 

				MONK 
		You must not talk to her. 

				KNIGHT 
		Can that be so dangerous?

				MONK 
		I don't know, but she is believed to have 
		caused the pestilence with which we are 
		affected. 

				KNIGHT 
		I understand.

He nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though 
she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two 
riders for a considerable distance down the road.
 


The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is 
empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.

They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS 
ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the 
path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and 
almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when 
no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft 
object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying 
with her face to the ground.

At the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man 
comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are 
black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and 
in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner 
room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the 
walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his 
bag.

Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully 
slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the 
door. She stops and stares at the stranger.

				RAVEL 
		Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the 
		dead. These days it's quite a lucrative 
		enterprise. 

The GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. 

				RAVEL 
		You're thinking of running to the village and 
		telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each 
		of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple 
		as that. 

				GIRL 
		Don't touch me.

				RAVAL 
		Don't try to scream. There's no one around to 
		hear you, neither God nor man.

Slowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost 
total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.

				JONS 
		I recognize you, although it's a long time 
		since we met. Your name is Raval, from the 
		theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. 
		Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. 

RAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. 

				JONS 
		Am I not right?

The GIRL stands immobile.

				JONS 
		You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced 
		my master of the necessity to join a better-
		class crusade to the Holy Land.

RAVAL looks around.
 
				JONS 
		You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
		ache? 

RAVAL smiles anxiously.

				JONS 
		When I see you, I suddenly understand the 
		meaning of these ten years, which previously 
		seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too 
		good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. 
		The Lord wanted to punish us for our 
		complacency. That is why He sent you to spew 
		out your holy venom and poison the knight.

				RAVEL 
		I acted in good faith.

				JONS 
		But now you know better, don't you? Because 
		now you have turned into a thief. A more 
		fitting and rewarding occupation for 
		scoundrels. Isn't that so?

With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a 
kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly 
the GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.
 
				JONS 
		By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty. 

He bends over RAVAL. 

				RAVEL 
		Don't beat me.

				JONS 
		I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. 
		But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll 
		brand your face the way one does with thieves. 
			(he rises)
		What I really came for is to get my waterskin 
		filled.

				GIRL 
		We have a deep well with cool, fresh water. 
		Come, I'll show you.

They walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises 
slowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals 
away. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps 
him.

				JONS 
		Jns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative 
		young man who has never had anything but kind 
		thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble 
		deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With 
		them, there is no limit to my kindness. 

He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost 
immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats 
the GIRL on the cheek.

				JONS 
		Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped 
		you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that 
		kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.

He laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance 
he turns; the GIRL is still there.

				JONS 
		Now that I think of it, I will need a 
		housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? 
			(the GIRL nods)
		As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but
		I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.
		That's why I need a housekeeper. 
			(the GIRL doesn't 
			answer but gets up)
		The devil with it! Come along and don't stand 
		there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe 
		me a great deal.

She begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but 
walks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.
 


The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague 
has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.

The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. 
Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.

The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are
merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands 
and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.
 
The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink 
beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps 
at JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay 
and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have 
finished SKAT comes forward and bows.

				SKAT 
		Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for 
		your interest. Please remain standing for a
		little longer, or sit on the ground, because 
		we are now going to perform a tragedia about 
		an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and 
		the handsome lover -- that's me.

MIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. 
They bow, to the public. 

				SKAT 
		Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If 
		you'll shut up over there, you'll see something 
		splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I 
		haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to 
		hide behind the curtain for the time being. 
			(he wipes the sweat 
			from his forehead)
		It's damned hot. I think we'll have a 
		thunderstorm.

He places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, 
makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, 
and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.

SKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin 
washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, 
glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks 
are flushed rose red.
 
He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and 
whistling to himself.
 
In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received 
with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as 
he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both 
height and volume.
 
SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but 
fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her 
shoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her 
generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity 
allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye 
immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.

Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing 
several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages 
not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the 
wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.
 
The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment 
the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.

When he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from 
the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.

She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy 
glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her 
small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in 
the bushes.

Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any 
longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack 
of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant 
expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.

SKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the 
chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.

His words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and 
pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance 
and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with 
frightened shrieks.



JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends 
to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. 

				JOF 
		Night and moonlight now prevail 
		Here sleeps my wife so frail ... 

				VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
		Does she snore?

				JOF 
		May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in 
		tragedies one doesn't snore.

				VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
		I think she should snore anyhow. 

This opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and 
goes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring. 

				JOF 
		Night and moonlight now prevail.
		There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. 
		Jealous I am, as never before, 
		I hide myself behind this door. 
		Faithful is she 
		To her lover -- not me. 
		He soon comes a-stealing 
		To awaken her lusty feeling. 
		I shall now kill him dead 
		For cuckolding me in my bed. 
		There he comes in the moonlight, 
		His white legs shining bright. 
		Quiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, 
		Tell him not that he's about to die.

JOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to 
the left. 

				MIA 
		Look, there he comes in the night 
		My lover, my heart's delight.

She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard 
in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the 
heat.
 
Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall 
silent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children 
stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.
 
JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression 
of horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the 
yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to 
mutter half-forgotten prayers.

All have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is 
heard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the 
hilltop.

The cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods 
pulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters 
with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out 
spasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway 
and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.

After the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, 
boys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges 
in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling 
ecstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are 
gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. 
They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost 
rhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their 
bursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourging.

Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks 
fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed 
tightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered 
cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, 
but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the 
face in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, 
suffering scorn and shame.
 
The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where 
they stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the 
monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
 
A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-
brown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.

				MONK
		God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall 
		all perish in the black death. You, standing 
		there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in 
		your glutted complacency, do you know that this 
		may be your last hour? Death stands right 
		behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in 
		the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it 
		above your heads. Which one of you shall he 
		strike first? You there, who stand staring like 
		a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the 
		last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, 
		woman, who bloom with life and self-
		satisfaction, will you pale and become 
		extinguished before the morning dawns? You back
		there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, 
		do you have another year left to dirty the 
		earth with your refuse? Do you know, you 
		insensible fools, that you shall die today or 
		tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you 
		have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do 
		you hear the word? You have been sentenced, 
		sentenced! 

The MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful
glance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face
upwards. 

				MONK
		Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't 
		turn your face from us in loathing and 
		contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of 
		your son, Jesus Christ. 

He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some 
superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing 
and moaning.

The procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; 
others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the 
squire drinks his beer.

				JONS 
		This damned ranting about doom. Is that food 
		for the minds of modern people? Do they really 
		expect us to take them seriously?

The KNIGHT grins tiredly.

				JONS 
		Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me 
		to point out that I've either read, heard or 
		experienced most of the tales which we people 
		tell each other. 

				KNIGHT 
			(yawns) 
		Yes, yes.
 
				JONS 
		Even the ghost stories about God the Father, 
		the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --
		all these I've accepted without too much 
		emotion.

He leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the 
head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.

				JONS 
			(contentedly)
		My little stomach is my world, my head is my 
		eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My 
		legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty 
		feet are two splendid starting points for my 
		philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as 
		much as a belch, the only difference being that 
		a belch is more satisfying.

The beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him 
like a shadow.

In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He 
stops JONS with a roar. 

				JONS 
		What are you screaming about?

				PLOG 
		I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire 
		Jns. 

				JONS 
		That's possible.

				PLOG 
		Have you seen my wife?
 
				JONS 
		No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she 
		looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd 
		seen her. 

				PLOG
		Well, in that case you haven't seen her. 

				JONS 
		Maybe she's run off. 

				PLOG 
		Do you know anything?
 
				JONS 
		I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go 
		to the inn. Maybe they can help you.

The smith sighs sadly and goes inside.

The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their 
newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns
on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays
piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and
perspiration.
 
				MERCHANT
		Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along 
		the west coast. People are dying like flies. 
		Usually business would be good at this time of 
		year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole 
		stock unsold.

				WOMAN 
		They speak of the judgment day. And all these 
		omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands 
		and other monstrosities began pouring out of 
		an old woman, and down in the village another 
		woman gave birth to a calf's head. 

				OLD MAN 
		The day of judgment. Imagine.

				FARMER
		It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely 
		lose our crops.

				MERCHANT
		And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee 
		the country and carry the plague with them 
		wherever they go. 

				OLD MAN 
		The day of judgment. Just think, just think! 

				FARMER 
		If it's as they say, I suppose a person should 
		look after his house and try to enjoy life as 
		long as he can. 

				WOMAN 
		But there have been other things too, such 
		things that can't even be spoken of. 
			(whispers)
		Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests 
		say that the woman carries it between her legs 
		and that's why she must cleanse herself. 

				OLD MAN 
		Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse 
		stand at the bend in the village road. I 
		imagine they'll come on judgment night, at 
		sundown.

				WOMAN 
		There are many who have purged themselves with
	 	fire and died from it, but the priests say that 
		it's better to die pure than to live for hell.
 
				MERCHANT 
		This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out
		loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And 
		people are going mad from fear.

				FARMER
		So you're afraid too. 

				MERCHANT
		Of course I'm afraid.

				OLD MAN 
		The judgment day becomes night, and the angels 
		descend and the graves open. It will be 
		terrible to see. 

They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.



PLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still 
dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, 
his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. 

				RAVAL 
		Do you want this armlet? You can have it 
		cheap. 

				JOF 
		I can't afford it. 

				RAVAL 
		It's real silver.

				JOF 
		It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for 
		me. 

				PLOG 
		Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? 

				JOF 
		Has she disappeared? 

				PLOG 
		They say she's run away. 

				JOF 
		Has she deserted you? 

				PLOG 
		With an actor.

				JOF 
		An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I 
		think you should let her go.

				PLOG 
		You're right. My first thought, of course, was 
		to kill her.

				JOF 
		Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing 
		to do. 

				PLOG 
		I'm also going to kill the actor. 

				JOF 
		The actor?

				PLOG 
		Of course, the one she eloped with. 

				JOF 
		What has he done to deserve that? 

				PLOG 
		Are you stupid?
 
				JOF 
		The actor! Now I understand. There are too many 
		of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in 
		particular you ought to kill him merely because 
		he's an actor. 

				PLOG 
		You see, my wife has always been interested in 
		the tricks of the theatre.

				JOF 
		And that turned out to be her misfortune. 

				PLOG 
		Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person 
		who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from 
		any further misfortune. Isn't that true?

Now RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill 
and evil.
 
				RAVAL 
		Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the 
		smith. 

				JOF 
		I! A liar!
 
				RAVAL 
		You're an actor too and it's probably your 
		partner who's run off with Plog's old lady. 

				PLOG 
		Are you an actor too?

				JOF 
		An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! 

				RAVAL 
		We ought to kill you; it's only logical. 

				JOF 
			(laughs)
		You're really funny.

				RAVAL 
		How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you 
		anything on your conscience?

				JOF 
		You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? 
			(to Plog)
		Oh, you don't.

				RAVAL 
		Maybe we should mark you up a little with a 
		knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your 
		kind.

PLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.
 
				PLOG 
			(shouting)
		What have you done with my wife? 

The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to 
escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the 
air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.

JOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as 
if the truth had just become apparent to him.
 
				JOF 
		Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked 
		someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right 
		now and never come back.

JOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or 
come to his defense.
 
 				RAVAL 
		Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. 

Trembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a 
word comes out.
 
				RAVAL 
		Stand on your head so that we can see how good 
		an actor you are.

JOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so
that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one 
hand. 

				PLOG 
			(shouts) 
		What have you done with my wife? 

PLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over
him.
 
				RAVAL 
		Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. 

				JOF 
		I don't want to. I can't.

				RAVEL 
		Show us how you imitate a bear. 

				JOF 
		I can't play a bear.

				RAVAL 
		Let's see if you can't after all.

RAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on 
his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop 
on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs 
were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. 

				RAVEL 
		Up again! Be a good bear.

				JOF 
		I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the 
		strength to play a bear any more.

At that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals
out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at 
each other. 

				JONS 
		Do you remember what I was going to do to you 
		if we met again?

RAVAL steps back without speaking. 

				JONS 
		I'm a man who keeps his word.

JONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers 
towards the wall.
 


The hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. 
In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and
the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.
 
The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse 
grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son 
in her arms. They play together and laugh happily.

Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the 
red clouds over the sea.

Not far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He 
lifts his head.

The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and 
the child. The KNIGHT gets up.

MIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the 
KNIGHT. 

				KNIGHT 
		What's his name? 

				MIA 
		Mikael.

				KNIGHT 
		How old is he? 

				MIA 
		Oh, he'll soon be two. 

				KNIGHT 
		He's big for his age.

				MIA 
		Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. 

She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red 
skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.

				KNIGHT 
		You played some kind of show this afternoon. 

				MIA 
		Did you think it was bad?

				KNIGHT 
		You are more beautiful now without your face 
		painted, and this gown is more becoming.

				MIA 
		You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, 
		so we're in real trouble now.

				KNIGHT 
		Is that your husband?

				MIA 
			(laughs)
		Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is 
		Jof.
 
				KNIGHT 
		Oh, that one.

				MIA 
		And now there's only him and me. We'll have to 
		start doing tricks again and that's more 
		trouble than it's worth. 

				KNIGHT 
		Do you do tricks also?

				MIA 
		We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful 
		juggler.

				KNIGHT 
		Is Mikael going to be an acrobat? 

				MIA 
		Jof wants him to be. 

				KNIGHT 
		But you don't.

				MIA 
		I don't know.
			(smiling)
		Perhaps he'll become a knight. 

				KNIGHT 
		Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either. 

				MIA 
		No, you don't look so happy. 

				KNIGHT 
		No.

				MIA 
		Are you tired? 

				KNIGHT 
		Yes. 

				MIA 
		Why?
 
				KNIGHT 
		I have dull company. 

				MIA 
		Do you mean your squire? 

				KNIGHT 
		No, not him.

				MIA 
		Who do you mean, then? 

				KNIGHT 
		Myself. 

				MIA 
		I understand. 

				KNIGHT 
		Do you, really?
 
				MIA 
		Yes, I understand rather well. I have often 
		wondered why people torture themselves as often 
		as they can. Isn't that so?

She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and 
the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass 
mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her 
arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like 
a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and 
sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?
What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She 
runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's
dirty, bloody face.
 
Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his 
forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems 
unhurt. 

				JOF 
		Ouch, it hurts.

				MIA
		Why did you have to go there? And of course you 
		drank.

MIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder 
than necessary. 

				JOF 
		Ouch! I didn't drink anything.

				MIA
		Then I suppose you were boasting about the 
		angels and devils you consort with. People 
		don't like someone who has too many ideas and 
		fantasies.

				JOF 
		I swear to you that I didn't say a word about 
		angels. 

				MIA
		You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. 
		You can never stop being an actor. People also 
		become angry at that, and you know it.

JOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of 
MIA with an injured expression. 

				JOF 
		Look what I bought for you. 

				MIA 
		You couldn't afford it. 

				JOF 
			(angry)
		But I got it anyhow.

The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her 
wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each 
other, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and 
sighs.

				JOF 
		Oh, how they beat me.

				MIA 
		Why didn't you beat them back?

				JOF 
		I only become frightened and angry. I never get 
		a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know 
		that. I roared like a lion.

				MIA
		Were they frightened? 

				JOF 
		No, they just laughed.

Their son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls 
his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully 
sniffs at MIKAEL.

				MIA 
		Do you notice how good he smells?

				JOF 
		And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy 
		one. A real acrobat's body.

He lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, 
remembering the knight's presence. 

				MIA 
		Yes, this is my husband, Jof. 

				JOF 
		Good evening. 

				KNIGHT 
		Good evening.
 
JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one 
another silently.
 
				KNIGHT 
		I have just told your wife that you have a 
		splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. 

				JOF 
		Yes, he's fine.
     
They become silent again.
 
				JOF 
		Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? 

				KNIGHT 
		Thank you, I don't want anything.

				MIA 
			(housewifely)
		I picked a basket of wild strawberries this 
		afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh 
		from a cow ... 

				JOF 
		... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you 
		would like to partake of this humble fare, it 
		would be a great honor. 

				MIA 
		Please be seated and I'll bring the food. 

They sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. 

				KNIGHT 
		Where are you going next? 

				JOF 
		Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore. 

				KNIGHT 
		I wouldn't advise you to go there. 

				JOF 
		Why not, if I may ask?

				KNIGHT 
		The plague has spread in that direction, 
		following the coast line south. It's said that 
		people are dying by the tens of thousands.

				JOF 
		Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. 

				KNIGHT 
		May I suggest ... 
			(JOF looks at him, surprised)
 		... that you follow me through the forest 
		tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go 
		along the east coast. You'll probably be safer 
		there.

MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it 
between them and gives each of them a spoon.

				JOF 
		I wish you good appetite. 

				KNIGHT 
		I humbly thank you.

				MIA 
		These are wild strawberries from the forest. I 
		have never seen such large ones. They grow up 
		there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!

She points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering 
some profound thought. JOF eats heartily.

				JOF 
		Your suggestion is good, but I must think it 
		over. 

				MIA 
		It might be wise to have company going through 
		the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and 
		ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.

				JOF 
			(staunchly)
		Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I 
		have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, 
		I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I 
		have become director of the whole company.

				MIA 
			(mimics) 
		After all, I have become director of the whole 
		company.

JONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA 
points with her spoon. 

				MIA 
		Do you want some strawberries?

				JOF 
		This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, 
		and let us be together.

				MIA 
			(stretches herself) 
		Oh, how nice this is. 

				KNIGHT 
		For a short while.
 
				MIA 
		Nearly always. One day is like another. There 
		is nothing strange about that. The summer, of 
		course, is better than the winter, because in 
		summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is 
		best of all.

				JOF 
		I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps 
		you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. 

He sprints towards the wagon.
 
 				MIA 
		Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by 
		your songs.

				JONS 
			(politely) 
		By all means. I write little songs myself. For 
		example, I know a very funny song about a 
		wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. 

The KNIGHT looks at him.

				JONS 
		You'll not get to hear it either. There are 
		persons here who don't appreciate my art and I 
		don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive 
		soul.

JOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the 
instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies 
down. 

				KNIGHT 
		People are troubled by so much.

				MIA 
		It's always better when one is two. Have you no 
		one of your own?

				KNIGHT 
		Yes, I think I had someone. 

				MIA 
		And what is she doing now? 

				KNIGHT 
		I don't know.

				MIA 
		You look so solemn. Was she your beloved? 

				KNIGHT 
		We were newly married and we played together. 
		We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her 
		eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little 
		ears. We went hunting together and at night we 
		danced. The house was full of life ... 

				MIA 
		Do you want some more strawberries?

				KNIGHT 
			(shakes his head)
		Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is 
		like loving someone who is out there in the 
		darkness but never appears, no matter how 
		loudly you call. 

				MIA 
		I don't understand what you mean.

				KNIGHT 
		Everything I've said seems meaningless and 
		unreal while I sit here with you and your 
		husband. How unimportant it all becomes 
		suddenly.

He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several 
times. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.

				MIA 
		Now you don't look so solemn.

				KNIGHT 
		I shall remember this moment. The silence, the 
		twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,
		your faces in the evening light. Mikael 
		sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to 
		remember what we have talked about. I'll carry 
		this memory between my hands as carefully as 
		if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh 
		milk. 

He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray 
sky. 

				KNIGHT 
		And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be 
		enough for me.

He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues 
to play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.

The KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is 
quiet and deserted; the sea is still. 

				DEATH 
		I have been waiting for you.

				KNIGHT 
		Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. 
		Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in 
		retreat. It's your move.

				DEATH 
		Why do you look so satisfied? 

				KNIGHT 
		That's my secret.
 
				DEATH 
		Of course. Now I take your knight. 

				KNIGHT 
		You did the right thing. 

				DEATH 
		Have you tricked me?
 
				KNIGHT 
		Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check! 

				DEATH 
		What are you laughing at?

				KNIGHT 
		Don't worry about my laughter; save your king 
		instead.

				DEATH 
		You're rather arrogant. 

				KNIGHT 
		Our game amuses me.

				DEATH 
		It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed 
		for time.

				KNIGHT 
		I understand that you've a lot to do, but you 
		can't get out of our game. It takes time.

DEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT 
smiles.

				DEATH 
		Are you going to escort the juggler and his 
		wife through the forest? Those whose names are 
		Jof and Mia and who have a small son? 

				KNIGHT 
		Why do you ask? 

				DEATH 
		Oh, no reason at all.
 
The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.
 


Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.
There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their 
son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. 

JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a 
last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands 
and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the 
small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his 
hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic 
sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. 

				JONS 
		God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? 

				PLOG 
		Good evening.

				JONS 
		Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? 

				PLOG 
		Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a 
		rabbit. 

				JONS 
		If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get 
		rid of a wife in such an easy way.

JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down 
by his side. 

				PLOG 
		Are you married?
 
				JONS 
		I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count 
		of all my wives any longer. But it's often that 
		way when you're a traveling man.

				PLOG 
		I can assure you that one wife is worse than a 
		hundred, or else I've had worse luck than any 
		poor wretch in this miserable world, which 
		isn't impossible.

				JONS 
		Yes, it's hell with women and hell without 
		them. So, however you look at it, it's still 
		best to kill them off while it's most amusing.
 
				PLOG 
		Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and 
		wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows 
		and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a 
		mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to 
		sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- 
		tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake 
		the dead. 

JONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's 
voice. 

				JONS 
		Why don't you kiss me good night?

				PLOG 
			(in the same way)
		Why don't you sing a song for me? 

				JONS 
		Why don't you love me the way you did when we 
		first met?

				PLOG 
		Why don't you look at my new slip? 

				JONS 
		You only turn your back and snore. 

				PLOG 
		Oh hell!
 
				JONS 
		Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!
 
				PLOG 
			(furious) 
		I'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in 
		their chests with a small hammer, I'll tap 
		their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.

PLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of 
sorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.

				JONS
		Look how he howls again. 

				PLOG 
		Maybe I love her.

				JONS 
		So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor 
		misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is 
		another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust 
		and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and 
		all kinds of other fooling around. 

				PLOG
		Yes, but it hurts anyway.

				JONS 
		Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, 
		and if one could die of it, there would be 
		some pleasure in love. But you almost always 
		get over it. 

				PLOG
		No, no, not me.

				JONS 
		Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor 
		wretches who die of love once in a while. Love 
		is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats 
		away at your strength, your independence, your 
		morale, if you have any. If everything is 
		imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most 
		perfect in its perfect imperfection.

				PLOG 
		You're happy, you with your oily words, and, 
		besides, you believe your own drivel.

				JONS 
		Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I 
		love to give good advice. If you ask me for 
		advice you'll get two pieces for the price of 
		one, because after all I really am an educated 
		man.

JONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes 
very unhappy and grabs his belt. 

				PLOG 
		Listen, Jns. May I go with you through the 
		forest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home 
		because everyone will laugh at me.

				JONS 
		Only if you don't whimper all the time, because 
		in that case we'll all have to avoid you.

PLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk 
towards the door.
 
When they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, 
becomes angry and yells a warning to JONS.
 
				JOF 
		Jns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all 
		the time. He's not quite sane.

				JONS 
		Yes, but now he's just sniveling.

PLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand.

				PLOG 
		I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have 
		such a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.

JOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and 
squeezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by 
great good will and opens his arms.

				PLOG 
		Come in my arms, little brother.

				JOF 
		Thank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now 
		we're really in a hurry.

JOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse.
 


The small company is on its way towards the forest and the night.

It is dark in the forest.
 
First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting 
close to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. 
JONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The 
GIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep.

The footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing 
-- yet it is quiet.
 
Then the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with 
the night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of 
the beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.

The wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their 
faces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet.

				PLOG
		Now the moon has come out of the clouds. 

				JONS 
		That's good. Now we can see the road better. 

				MIA 
		I don't like the moon tonight. 

				JOF 
		The trees stand so still.
 
				JONS 
		That's because there's no wind. 

				PLOG 
		I guess he means that they stand very still. 

				JOF 
		It's completely quiet.

				JONS 
		If one could hear a fox at least. 

				JOF 
		Or an owl.

				JONS 
		Or a human voice besides one's own.

				GIRL
		They say it's dangerous to remain standing in 
		moonlight.

Suddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest 
road, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place 
where she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, 
carrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with 
iron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the 
moonlight.
 
A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his 
head. 

				JONS 
		Where are you going? 

				SOLDIER
		To the place of execution.

				JONS 
		Yes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done 
		it with the Black One. The witch?

The SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides 
his horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, 
but her eyes are wide open.

				KNIGHT 
		I see that they have hurt your hands.

The WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her 
head. 

				KNIGHT 
		I have a potion that will stop your pain.

She shakes her head again.
 
				JONS 
		Why do you burn her at this time of night? 
		People have so few diversions these days.
 
				SOLDIER 
		Saints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that 
		she brings the Devil with her wherever she 
		goes. 

				JONS 
		You are eight brave men, then.

				SOLDIER 
		Well, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer 
		job. 

The SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH.

				KNIGHT 
			(to the WITCH)
		What's your name? 

				TYAN
		My name is Tyan, my lord. 

				KNIGHT 
		How old are you? 

				TYAN
		Fourteen, my lord.

				KNIGHT 
		And is it true that you have been in league 
		with the Devil?

TYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At 
the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been 
stacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, 
hesitant and curious.
 
The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.
They nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be 
bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.

The sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has 
dismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, 
touches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face 
towards him.
 
				KNIGHT 
		They say that you have been in league with the 
		Devil.

				TYAN
		Why do you ask?

				KNIGHT 
		Not out of curiosity, but for very personal 
		reasons. I too want to meet him. 

				TYAN 
		Why?

				KNIGHT 
		I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, 
		must know.

				TYAN 
		You can see him anytime. 

				KNIGHT 
		How?

				TYAN 
		You must do as I tell you.

The KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles 
whiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. 

				TYAN 
		Look into my eyes.

The KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time.

				TYAN 
		What do you see? Do you see him?

				KNIGHT 
		I see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. 
		But nothing else.

He falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in 
the forest. 

				TYAN 
		No one, nothing, no one? 

				KNIGHT 
			(shakes his head)
		No.

				TYAN
		Can't you see him behind your back? 

				KNIGHT 
			(looks around) 
		No, there is no one there. 

				TYAN 
		But he is with me everywhere. I only have to 
		stretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He 
		is with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He 
		will protect me from everything evil.

				KNIGHT 
		Has he told you this? 

				TYAN 
		I know it.

				KNIGHT 
		Has he said it?

				TYAN 
		I know it, I know it. You must see him 
		somewhere, you must. The priests had no 
		difficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. 
		They are so afraid of him that they don't even 
		dare touch me.

The sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted 
in the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN 
moans weakly, as if she were far away.

				KNIGHT 
		Why have you crushed her hands? 

				SOLDIER
			(surly) 
		We didn't do it. 

				KNIGHT 
		Who did? 

				SOLDIER
		Ask the monk.

The soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming 
in the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound 
emerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and 
the stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. 

				KNIGHT 
		What have you done with the child? 

DEATH turns around and looks at him. 

				DEATH 
		Don't you ever stop asking questions? 

				KNIGHT 
		No, I'll never stop.

The soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, 
moans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position.
 
When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT 
steps up and leans over her. 

				JONS 
		For a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, 
		but it would do no good. She's nearly dead 
		already. 

One of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and 
sweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill.

				SOLDIER
		I've told you to be careful. Don't go too close 
		to her.

The KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water 
from the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion.

				KNIGHT 
		Take this and it will stop the pain.

Smoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step 
forward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there 
motionlessly, her eyes wide open.

The KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice 
nearly choked with rage. 

				JONS 
		What does she see? Can you tell me? 

				KNIGHT 
			(shakes his head) 
		She feels no more pain. 

				JONS 
		You don't answer my question. Who watches over 
		that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the 
		Devil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my 
		lord!

				KNIGHT 
		This cannot be.

				JONS 
		Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has 
		just made a discovery. Emptiness under the 
		moon. 

				KNIGHT 
		No.

				JONS 
		We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our 
		sides, because we see what she sees, and our 
		terror and hers are the same. 
			(an outburst) 
		That poor little child. I can't stand it, I 
		can't stand it ...

His voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts
his horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her 
eyes.
 


The forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon 
squeaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.
 
JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around 
MIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.

His silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk 
and support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over 
his face and howls piteously. 

				PLOG 
		Oh, now it came over me again! 

				JONS 
		Don't scream. What came over you?

				PLOG 
		My wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is 
		so beautiful that she can't be described 
		without the accompaniment of a lyre.

				JONS 
		Now it starts again.

				PLOG 
		Her smile is like brandy. Her eyes like 
		blackberries ...

PLOG searches for beautiful words. He gestures gropingly with his large 
hands.

				JONS 
			(sighs) 
		Get up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the 
		others.

				PLOG 
		Yes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a 
		little pink potato; her behind is like a juicy 
		pear -- yes, the whole woman is like a 
		strawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, 
		with arms like wonderful cucumbers.

				JONS 
		Saints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, 
		despite the fact that you're drunk. And your 
		vegetable garden bores me.

They walk across an open meadow. Here it is a little brighter and the moon 
shimmers behind a thin sky. Suddenly PLOG points a large finger towards the 
edge of the forest. 

				PLOG 
		Look there.

				JONS 
		Do you see something? 

				PLOG 
		There, over there! 

				JONS 
		I don't see anything.

				PLOG 
		Hang on to something, my friends. The hour is 
		near! Who is that at the edge of the forest if 
		not my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?

The two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT 
immediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and 
bellowing like a wild boar.

For a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and 
bushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, 
because both of them are equally frightened.

The travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once 
in a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.

				SKAT 
			(panting) 
		You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven 
		scurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I 
		would be stricken with such eternal shame about 
		my breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in 
		short, about my whole body -- that I would 
		immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing 
		self. 

				PLOG 
			(angry) 
		Watch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart 
		on you and immediately blow you down to the 
		actor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and 
		recite monologues to each other until the dust 
		comes out of the Devil's ears. 

Then LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. 

				LISA 
		Forgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do 
		it again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine 
		how terribly that man over there betrayed me. 

				PLOG 
		I'll kill him anyway.

				LISA 
		Yes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a 
		human being.

				JONS 
		Hell, he's an actor.

				LISA 
		He is only a false beard, false teeth, false 
		smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a 
		jug. Just kill him. 

LISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. 
SKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point 
against his breast.

				SKAT 
		She's right. Just kill me. If you thought that 
		I was going to apologize for being what I am, 
		you are mistaken. 

				LISA 
		Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool 
		of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, 
		kill him. 

				SKAT 
		My friends, you have only to push, and my 
		unreality will soon be transformed into a new, 
		solid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.

				LISA 
		Do something then. Kill him.

				PLOG 
			(embarrassed) 
		He has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.

				SKAT 
		Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged 
		shred. Idiot, your day is short.

				PLOG 
		You'll have to irritate me a little more to get 
		me as angry as before.

SKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes 
towards the night sky. 

				SKAT 
		I forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. 

SKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The 
travelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. 

				PLOG 
		Oh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, 
		there's no life left in him. I was beginning to 
		like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too 
		spiteful. 

JOF leans over his colleague.

				JOF 
		He's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, 
		I've never seen such a dead actor.

				LISA 
		Come on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn 
		over. He has only himself to blame.

				PLOG 
		And I have to be married to her. 

				JONS 
		We must go on.

SKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. 
The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on 
the other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he 
sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a 
blade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.

				SKAT 
		Now that was a good scene. I'm really a good 
		actor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little 
		pleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll 
		wait until it becomes light and then I'll find 
		the easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb 
		up a tree for the time being so that no bears, 
		wolves or ghosts can get at me.

He soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits 
down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch.

				SKAT 
			(yawns) 
		Tomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll 
		go to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make 
		lots of money there. 
			(yawns)
		Now, I'll sing a little song to myself: 
			(sings) 
		I am a little bird 
		Who sings whate'er he will, 
		And when I am in danger 
		I fling out a pissing trill 
		As in the carnal thrill.
			(speaks)
		It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. 
			(sings) 
		The terrible night doesn't frighten me ... 

He interrupts himself and listens. The sound of industrious sawing is heard 
through the silence.

				SKAT 
		Workmen in the forest. Oh, well! 
			(sings)
		The terrible night doesn't frighten me ... 
			(speaks)
		Hey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're 
		cutting down.

He peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently 
sawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry.
 
				SKAT 
		Hey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? 
		What are you doing with my tree?

The sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened.

				SKAT 
		Can't you at least answer me? Politeness costs 
		so little. Who are you?

DEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror.

				DEATH 
		I'm sawing down your tree because your time is
		up.
  
				SKAT
		It won't do. I haven't got time.

				DEATH 
		So you haven't got time. 

				SKAT 
		No, I have my performance. 

				DEATH 
		Then it's canceled because of death. 

				SKAT 
		My contract.
 
				DEATH 
		Your contract is terminated. 

				SKAT 
		My children, my family. 

				DEATH 
		Shame on you, Skat! 

				SKAT 
		Yes, I'm ashamed.

DEATH begins to saw again. The tree creaks. 

				SKAT 
		Isn't there any way to get off? Aren't there 
		any special rules for actors?

				DEATH 
		No, not in this case. 

				SKAT 
		No loopholes, no exceptions? 

DEATH saws.

				SKAT
		Perhaps you'll take a bribe. 

DEATH saws.
 
				SKAT
		Help!

DEATH saws.

				SKAT 
		Help! Help!

The tree falls. The forest becomes silent again.
 


Night and then dawn.

The travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.
They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the 
wind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge 
boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen 
tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow.

MIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at 
the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and 
unstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind 
PLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens.

				JONS 
		Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to 
		hang over us like a smothering blanket.

				LISA 
		I'm so frightened.

				PLOG 
		We feel that something is going to happen to 
		us, but we don't know what.

				JONS 
		Maybe it's the day of judgment. 

				PLOG 
		The day of judgment ...

Now, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a 
moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens
intently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the
darkness. 

				RAVAL 
		Do you have some water?

RAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, 
but his voice is heard again. 

				RAVAL 
		Can't you give me a little water? 
			(pause) 
		I have the plague.

				JONS 
		Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your 
		throat. Keep to the other side of the tree. 

				RAVEL 
		I'm afraid of death.

No one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The 
dry leaves rustle with his movements. 

				RAVEL 
		I don't want to die! I don't want to!
 
No one answers. RAVAL'S face appears suddenly at the base of the tree. His 
eyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam.

				RAVAL 
		Can't you have pity on me? Help me! At least 
		talk to me.

No one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. 

				RAVAL 
		I am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to 
		me! Can no one console me? Haven't you any 
		compassion? Can't you see that I ...

His words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness 
behind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments.

				RAVAL 
			(whispers) 
		Can't anyone ... only a little water. 

Suddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag 
and runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast.

				JONS 
		It's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no 
		use. It's meaningless. It's totally 
		meaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. 
		Can't you hear that I'm consoling you? 

				RAVEL 
		Help me, help me!

No one answers, no one moves. RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a 
frightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it 
becomes quiet.
 
The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on 
her shoulder.
 

16
The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand.

				DEATH 
		Shall we play our game to the end? 

				KNIGHT 
		Your move!

DEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen. Antonius Block looks at 
DEATH. 

				DEATH 
		Now I take your queen. 

				KNIGHT 
		I didn't notice that.

The KNIGHT leans over the game. The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, 
which seem to have a life of their own.

JOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the 
KNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. 

				JOF 
		Mia!
 
				MIA 
		Yes, what is it?
 
				JOF 
		I see something terrible. Something I almost 
		can't talk about.

				MIA 
		What do you see?

				JOF 
		The knight is sitting over there playing chess. 

				MIA 
		Yes, I can see that too and I don't think it's 
		so terrible. 

				JOF 
		But do you see who he's playing with? 

				MIA 
		He is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.
 
				JOF 
		No, no, he isn't alone. 

				MIA 
		Who is it, then?
 
				JOF 
		Death. He is sitting there playing chess with 
		Death himself.

				MIA 
		You mustn't say that. 

				JOF 
		We must try to escape. 

				MIA 
		One can't do that.

				JOF 
		We must try. They are so occupied with their 
		game that if we move very quietly, they won't 
		notice us. 

JOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA 
remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT 
and the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.

				JOF 
		I have harnessed the horse. The wagon is 
		standing near the big tree. You go first and 
		I'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael 
		doesn't wake up.

MIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from
his game. 

				DEATH 
		It is your move, Antonius Block.

The KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the
wagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. 

				DEATH 
		Have you lost interest in our game?
 
The KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently.

				KNIGHT
		Lost interest? On the contrary.

				DEATH 
		You seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? 

				KNIGHT 
		Nothing escapes you -- or does it? 

				DEATH 
		Nothing escapes me. No one escapes from me. 

				KNIGHT 
		It's true that I'm worried.

He pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his 
coat. He looks up at DEATH. 

				KNIGHT
		I've forgotten how the pieces stood.

				DEATH 
			(laughs contentedly) 
		But I have not forgotten. You can't get away 
		that easily.
 
DEATH leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. The KNIGHT looks past 
him towards the road. MIA has just climbed up on the wagon. JOF takes the 
horse by the bridle and leads it down the road. DEATH notices nothing; he is 
completely occupied with reconstructing the game.

				DEATH 
		Now I see something interesting. 

				KNIGHT 
		What do you see?

				DEATH 
		You are mated on the next move, Antonius Block. 

				KNIGHT 
		That's true.

				DEATH 
		Did you enjoy your reprieve? 

				KNIGHT 
		Yes, I did.

				DEATH 
		I'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you. 
		When we meet again, you and your companions' 
		time will be up.

				KNIGHT 
		And you will divulge your secrets. 

				DEATH 
		I have no secrets. 

				KNIGHT 
		So you know nothing. 

				DEATH 
		I have nothing to tell.

The KNIGHT wants to answer, but DEATH is already gone.

A murmur is heard in the tree tops. Dawn comes, a flickering light without 
life, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the 
twisting road. MIA sits beside him. 

				MIA
		What a strange light.

				JOF 
		I guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with 
		dawn. 

				MIA 
		No, it's something else. Something terrible. Do 
		you hear the roar in the forest? 

				JOF 
		It's probably rain.

				MIA 
		No, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's 
		following us. He has overtaken us; he's coming 
		towards us. 

				JOF 
		Not yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. 

				MIA 
		I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.

The wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse 
stops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs 
ponderously. 

				JOF 
		Get into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. 
		We'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.

They crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.

				JOF 
		It is the Angel of Death that's passing over 
		us, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of 
		Death, and he's very big.

				MIA 
		Do you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm 
		terribly cold.

She shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie 
closely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar 
outside is like a giant bellowing.
 


The castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now
the storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and
abutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night.

Antonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it
seems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and
quiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily.

Suddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each
other quietly.

				KARIN
		I heard from people who came from the crusade 
		that you were on your way home. I've been 
		waiting for you here. All the others have fled 
		from the plague. 

The KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. 

				KARIN 
		Don't you recognize me any more? 

The KNIGHT nods, silent. 

				KARIN 
		You also have changed.

She walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in 
her eyes and she touches his hand lightly.

				KARIN 
		Now I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your 
		eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and 
		frightened, is that boy who went away so many 
		years ago. 

				KNIGHT 
		It's over now and I'm a little tired. 

				KARIN 
		I see that you're tired. 

				KNIGHT 
		Over there stand my friends.

				KARIN 
		Ask them in. They will break the fast with us. 

They all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the 
walls. Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat. KARIN 
sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book. 

				KARIN 
		"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, 
		there was silence in heaven for about the space 
		of half an hour. And I saw the seven angels 
		which stood before God; and to them were given 
		seven trumpets. And another ..." 

Three mighty knocks sound on the large portal. KARIN interrupts her reading 
and looks up from the book. JONS rises quickly and goes to open the door.

 				KARIN 
		"The first angel sounded, and there followed 
		hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were 
		cast upon the earth; and the third part of the 
		trees was burnt up and all the green grass was 
		burnt up."

Now the rain becomes quiet. There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence 
in the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over 
the ceiling and the walls. Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.

 				KARIN 
		"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a 
		great mountain burning with fire was cast into 
		the sea; and a third part of the sea became 
		blood ..."

Steps are heard on the stairs. JONS returns and sits down silently at his 
place but does not continue to eat. 

				KNIGHT 
		Was someone there? 

				JONS 
		No, my lord. I saw no one.

KARIN lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.

				KARIN 
		"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a 
		great star from heaven, burning as it were a 
		torch, and it fell upon the third part of the 
		rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and 
		the name of the star is called Wormwood ..." 

They all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them
through the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand 
close together. 

				KNIGHT 
		Good morning, noble lord.

				KARIN 
		I am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you 
		courteously to my house.

				PLOG 
		I am a smith by profession and rather good at 
		my trade, if I say so myself. My wife Lisa -- 
		curtsy for the great lord, Lisa. She's a little 
		difficult to handle once in a while and we had
		a little spat, so to speak, but no worse than 
		most people.

The KNIGHT hides his face in his hands.

				KNIGHT
		From our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord. 
		Have mercy on us because we are small and 
		frightened and ignorant. 

				JONS 
			(bitterly) 
		In the darkness where You are supposed to be, 
		where all of us probably are.... In the 
		darkness You will find no one to listen to Your 
		cries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash 
		Your tears and mirror Yourself in Your 
		indifference.

				KNIGHT
 		God, You who are somewhere, who must be 
		somewhere, have mercy upon us.

				JONS 
		I could have given you an herb to purge you of 
		your worries about eternity. Now it seems to be 
		too late. But in any case, feel the immense 
		triumph of this last minute when you can still 
		roll your eyes and move your toes. 

				KARIN 
		Quiet, quiet.

				JONS 
		I shall be silent, but under protest. 

				GIRL 
			(on her knees)
		It is the end.
 


JOF and MIA sit close together and listen to the rain tapping lightly on the 
wagon canvas, a sound which diminishes until finally there are only single 
drops. 

They crawl out of their hiding place. The wagon stands on a height above a 
slope, protected by an enormous tree. They look across ridges, forests, the 
wide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the 
clouds.
 
JOF stretches his arms and legs. MIA dries the wagon seat and sits down next
to her husband. MIKAEL crawls between JOF'S knees.

A lone bird tests its voice after the storm. The trees and bushes drip. From 
the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.

JOF points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like 
silver needles over the horizon. 

				JOF 
		I see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against 
		the dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The 
		smith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and 
		Jns and Skat. And Death, the severe master, 
		invites them to dance. He tells them to hold 
		each other's hands and then they must tread the 
		dance in a long row. And first goes the master 
		with his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles 
		at the end with his lyre. They dance away from 
		the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the 
		dark lands, while the rain washes their faces 
		and cleans the salt of the tears from their 
		cheeks. 

He is silent. He lowers his hand. His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.
Now, he crawls up to MIA and sits down in her lap. 

				MIA 
			(smiling) 
		You with your visions and dreams.

                                     SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?

                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.

                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows

                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-huh. That's the place.

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE
                         Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
 
                         
               Here we have some rules

               Let us lay them down

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               Please keep off of the grass

               Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
                         the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
                         I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
                         won't know which way they're goin'. 
                         (walks off)
 
               EMPTY ROOM

               Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
                         to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
                         the stair master. I've mastered the 
                         stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
                         I'd step all over it.
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.

                                     SHREK
                         Well, at least we know where the princess 
                         is, but where's the...
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Dragon!

               Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               breathes fire.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
                         a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
                         on) Got ya!
 
               The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
               goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
               tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
               on the floor.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Aah! Aah!

               Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
               part of the bridge he's on.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
                         what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
                         growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
                         I know you probably hear this all time 
                         from your food, but you must bleach, 
                         'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
                         got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
                         freshness? And you know what else? You're 
                         - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
                         I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
                         You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
                         (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
                         at him) What's the matter with you? 
                         You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
                         Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
                         but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
                         blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
                         heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
                         an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
                         work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
                         rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
                         up with her teeth and carries him off) 
                         No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
 
               FIONA'S ROOM

               Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               and shakes her away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Oh! Oh!

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up!

                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         Are you Princess Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

                                     FIONA
                         But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our 
                         first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
                         romantic moment?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
                         sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
                         and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
                         haven't you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) Mm-hmm.

               Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
               the hallway.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But we have to savor this moment! You 
                         could recite an epic poem for me. A 
                         ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I don't think so.

                                     FIONA
                         Can I at least know the name of my champion?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     FIONA
                         Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
                         out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
                         take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Thanks!

               Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

                                     FIONA
                         (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
                         (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
                         him.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         But this isn't right! You were meant 
                         to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
                         That's what all the other knights did.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
                         stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
                         ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
                         off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
                         going? The exit's over there.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I have to save my ass.

                                     FIONA
                         What kind of knight are you?

                                     SHREK
                         One of a kind. (opens the door into 
                         the throne room)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
                         I believe it's healthy to get to know 
                         someone over a long period of time. 
                         Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
                         worriedly) (we see him up close and 
                         from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
                         the room) I don't want to rush into 
                         a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
                         ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
                         - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
                         looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
                         is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
                         are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
                         back up a little and take this one step 
                         at a time. We really should get to know 
                         each other first as friends or pen pals. 
                         I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
                         receiving cards - - I'd really love 
                         to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
                         my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
                         gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
                         - - What are you gonna do with that? 
                         Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
                         No, no, no. No! Oh!
 
               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hi, Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         It talks!

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
                         the trick.
 
               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
               off and walks lightly.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
                         take care of the dragon.
 
               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
               is still around the dragons neck.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (echoing) Run!

               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
                         did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
                         (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
                         You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
                         (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
                         hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
                         unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
                         is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
                         eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
                         his throat.) And where would a brave 
                         knight be without his noble steed?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I hope you heard that. She called me 
                         a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         The battle is won. You may remove your 
                         helmet, good Sir Knight.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, no.

                                     FIONA
                         Why not?

                                     SHREK
                         I have helmet hair.

                                     FIONA
                         Please. I would'st look upon the face 
                         of my rescuer.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

                                     FIONA
                         But how will you kiss me?

                                     SHREK
                         What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
                         job description.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Maybe it's a perk.

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
                         how it goes. A princess locked in a 
                         tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
                         by a brave knight, and then they share 
                         true love's first kiss.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
                         Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
                         love?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes.

               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.

                                     DONKEY
                         You think Shrek is your true love!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         What is so funny?

                                     SHREK
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look. I really don't think this is a 
                         good idea.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Just take off the helmet.

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not going to.

                                     FIONA
                         Take it off.

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FIONA
                         Now!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
                         (takes off his helmet)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
                         an ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
                         wants to marry you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Good question. You should ask him that 
                         when we get there.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But I have to be rescued by my true 
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
                         pet.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, so much for noble steed.

                                     SHREK
                         You're not making my job any easier.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
                         waiting for him right here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
                         her over his shoulder like she was a 
                         sack of potatoes)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

                                     SHREK
                         Ya comin', Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm right behind ya.

                                     FIONA
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the 
                         consequences! This is not dignified! 
                         Put me down!
 
               WOODS

               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say 
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, 
                         but you don't really like her that way. 
                         How do you let her down real easy so 
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?
 
                                     FIONA
                         You just tell her she's not your true 
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when 
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
                         DuLoc the better.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
                         It's beautiful!
 
                                     FIONA
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
                         What's he like?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
                         (he and Donkey laugh)
 
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
               the dust and grime.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't know. There are those who think 
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
                         just jealous you can never measure up 
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
                         when you see him tomorrow.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
                         to make camp?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
                         going.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But there's robbers in the woods.

                                     DONKEY
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
                         to sound good.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
                         we're going to see in this forest.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!
 
                         
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
 
               
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF

               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! Over here.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
                         a few homey touches.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
                         good night. (goes into the cave and 
                         puts the bark door up behind her)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
                         I will.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I said good night!

               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
               still inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, What are you doing?

                                     SHREK
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
                         come on. I was just kidding.
 
               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
               to Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three 
                         wheat fields.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
                         from these stars?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
                         famous for.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I know you're making this up.

                                     SHREK
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the 
                         group of hunters running away from his 
                         stench.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
                         dots.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Our swamp?

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, when we're through rescuing 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
                         deep just now. You know what I think? 
                         I think this whole wall thing is just 
                         a way to keep somebody out.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, do ya think?

                                     DONKEY
                         Are you hidin' something?

                                     SHREK
                         Never mind, Donkey.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion 
                         things, isn't it?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and 
                         leave-it alone things.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Why do you want to talk about it?

                                     DONKEY
                         Why are you blocking?

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not blocking.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yes, you are.

                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Who you trying to keep out?

                                     SHREK
                         Everyone! Okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
                         (grins)
 
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff 
                         and sits down)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's your problem? What you got against 
                         the whole world anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have 
                         a problem with me. People take one look 
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better 
                         off alone.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't 
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
                         ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     DONKEY
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
                         and Annoying.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
                         one, right there. That one there?
 
                         
               Fiona puts the door back.

                                     SHREK
                         That's the moon.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, okay.

               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom

               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.
 
                         
                                     MIRROR
                         Hmph.

               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ah. Perfect.

               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
               at her image in the mirror.
 
               MORNING

               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
               in his sleep.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
                         I like it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

                                     DONKEY
                         Huh? What?

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up.

                                     DONKEY
                         What? (stretches and yawns)

                                     FIONA
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
                         eggs?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!

               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

                                     SHREK
                         What's all this about?

                                     FIONA
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, thanks.

               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

                                     FIONA
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
                         of us. (walks off)
 
               LATER

               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
               forest. Shrek belches.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out 
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front 
                         of a princess.
 
               Fiona belches

                                     FIONA
                         Thanks.

                                     DONKEY
                         She's as nasty as you are.

                                     SHREK
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
                         what I expected.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
                         before you get to know them.
 
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
               a tree.
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         La liberte! Hey!

                                     SHREK
                         Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses 
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
                         disgust)...beast.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
                         own!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
                         little busy here?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't 
                         know who you think you are!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
                         (laughs)
 
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I steal from the rich and give to the 
                         needy.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He takes a wee percentage,

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
                         damsels, man, I'm good.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight 
                         and a saucy little maid...
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What he's basically saying is he likes 
                         to get...
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
 
                         
                                     MERRY MEN
                         That's bad.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
                         me awfully mad.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through 
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
                         'cause I'm about to start...
 
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Man, that was annoying!

               Shrek looks at her in admiration.

                                     MERRY MAN
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
 
                         
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
 
               
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
               and Fiona begins walking away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, shall we?

                                     SHREK
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins 
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
                         from?
 
                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! 
                         Where did you learn that?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, 
                         uh, one has to learn these things in 
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) 
                         there's an arrow in your butt!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
                         but flinches because it's tender)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
                         sorry.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (walking up) Why? What's wrong?

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek's hurt.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
                         Shrek's gonna die.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
                         a blue flower with red thorns.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
                         away from the light!

                         Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

                         What are the flowers for?

                                     FIONA
                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid 
                         of Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ah.

                                     FIONA
                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little 
                         pull)

                         (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the 
                         yankin'.
 
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         No, it's tender.

                                     FIONA
                         Now, hold on.

                         What you're doing is the opposite of 
                         help.

                         Don't move.

                         Look, time out.

                         hand over her face to stop her from 
                         getting at the arrow) Okay. What do 
                         you propose we do?

               Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

                         Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,

                         Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. 
                         (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just

                         over with Fiona on top of him)

                         turns to look at Fiona who holds up 
                         the arrow with a smile) Ow!

                         That's...is that blood?
 
               Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
               on their way.
 
               There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
               Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
               small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
               Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
               into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
               and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
               that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
               around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
               eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
               Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
               it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
               it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
               arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.

                         Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
                         Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
                         which I think means he has a really...(Shrek

                         Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move 
                         on.

                         Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried 
                         about Donkey.

                         I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
                         so good.

                         (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's 
                         what they always say, and then next 
                         thing you know, you're on your back.

                         Do you want to sit down?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
                         got this twinge in my neck, and when 
                         I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
                         his neck in a very sharp way until his 
                         head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'll get the firewood.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
                         feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
                         I don't have any toes! I think I need 
                         a hug.
 
               SUNSET

               Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
               Fiona eats.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
                         What is this?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

                         No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
                         I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
                         weed rat stew. (chuckles)
 
               Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.

                                     FIONA
                         I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
                         tomorrow night.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
                         sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
                         for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
                         - - you name it.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I'd like that.

               They smiles at each other.

                                     SHREK
                         Um, Princess?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) 
                         Are you gonna eat that?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? 
                         Just look at that sunset.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
                         late. I-It's very late.

                         What?

                                     DONKEY
                         Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
                         here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
                         you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
                         You know, I'd better go inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
                         be afraid of the dark, too, until - 
                         - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
                         the dark.
 
               Shrek sighs

                         Good night.

                                     SHREK
                         Good night.

               Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
               at Shrek with a new eye.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on 
                         here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, what are you talkin' about?

                                     DONKEY
                         I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
                         an animal, and I got instincts. And 
                         I know you two were diggin' on each 
                         other. I could feel it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
                         back to Farquaad.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
                         the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
                         her how you feel.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
                         even if I did tell her that, well, you 
                         know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
                         I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm 
                         - -
 
                                     DONKEY
                         An ogre?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. An ogre.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'?

                                     SHREK
                         To get... move firewood. (sighs)

               Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
               is.
 
               TIME LAPSE

               Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
               nowhere to be seen.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
                         where are you? Princess?
 
               Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
                         no games.
 
               Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
               look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
               out.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, help!

                                     FIONA
                         Shh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's okay. It's okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         What did you do with the princess?
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey, I'm the princess.

                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         It's me, in this body.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to 
                         her stomach) Can you hear me?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey!

                         (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, 
                         keep breathing! I'll get you out of 
                         there!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No!

                         This is me.

               Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
               down.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? What happened to you? You're, 
                         uh, uh, uh, different.

                         I'm ugly, okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
                         'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a 
                         bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.

                         No. I - - I've been this way as long 
                         as I can remember.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What do you mean? Look, I ain't never 
                         seen you like this before.

                         It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little 
                         girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every 
                         night I become this. This horrible,

                         to await the day my true love would 
                         rescue me. That's why I have to marry 
                         Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun 
                         sets and he sees me like this. (begins

                         it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. 
                         Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. 
                         But you only look like this at night.

                         But, you know, um, you're kind of an

                         Shrek?

               OUTSIDE

               Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
               hand.
 
                                     SHREK

                         it going, first of all? Good? Um, good 
                         for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
                         and thought of you because it's pretty 
                         and - - well, I don't really like it, 
                         but I thought you might like it 'cause 
                         you're pretty. But I like you anyway. 
                         I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. 
                         Okay, here we go.
 
               He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
               and Fiona talking.

                         really, who can ever love a beast so 
                         hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" 
                         don't go together. That's why I can't 
                         stay here with Shrek.
 
               Shrek steps back in shock.

               Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
               away.

               Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
               down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
               inside the windmill.
 
               MORNING

               Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
               awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.

                         runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! 
                         Shrek, there's something I want...(she 
                         looks and sees the rising sun, and as

                         into a human.)
 
               Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards 
               her.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek. Are you all right?

                                     SHREK
                         Perfect! Never been better.

                                     FIONA
                         I - - I don't - - There's something 
                         I have to tell you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You don't have to tell me anything, 
                         Princess. I heard enough last night.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         You heard what I said?

                                     SHREK
                         Every word.

                                     FIONA
                         I thought you'd understand.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who 
                         could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
                         you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at 
                         him in shock. He looks past her and 
                         spots a group approaching.) Ah, right 
                         on time. Princess, I've brought you 
                         a little something.
 
               Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
               sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
               like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
               march by.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots 
                         the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? 
                         Couldn't have been the donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona.

                                     SHREK
                         As promised. Now hand it over.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece 
                         of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared 
                         out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
                         I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) 
                         Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
                         you, but you startled me, for I have 
                         never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
                         I'm Lord Farquaad.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad 
                         snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, 
                         for I was just saying a short... (Watches 
                         as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
                         and set down in front of her. He comes 
                         to her waist.) farewell.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
                         to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
                         not like it has feelings.
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, you're right. It doesn't.

               Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
                         Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
                         Will you be the perfect bride for the 
                         perfect groom?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
                         make - -
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start 
                         the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
                         married today before the sun sets.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
                         The sooner, the better. There's so much 
                         to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
                         the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
                         up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona 
                         on the back of his horse)
 
                                     FIONA
                         Fare-thee-well, ogre.

               Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
               them go.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting 
                         her get away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? So what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, there's something about her you 
                         don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
                         night, She's - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         I know you talked to her last night. 
                         You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
                         you two are such good friends, why don't 
                         you follow her home?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

                                     SHREK
                         I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
                         home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
                         Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
                         Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
                         talking donkeys!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But I thought - -

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
                         (stomps off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek.

               Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
               being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
               into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
               alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
 
               SHREK'S HOME

               Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
               outside to investigate.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues 
                         with what he's doing.) What are you 
                         doing?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I would think, of all people, you would 
                         recognize a wall when you see one.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
                         to go around my swamp, not through it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         It is around your half. See that's your 
                         half, and this is my half.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! Your half. Hmm.

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
                         I did half the work. I get half the 
                         booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
                         the one that looks like your head.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Back off!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, you back off.

                                     SHREK
                         This is my swamp!

                                     DONKEY
                         Our swamp.

                                     SHREK
                         (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
                         with) Let go, Donkey!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You let go.

                                     SHREK
                         Stubborn jackass!

                                     DONKEY
                         Smelly ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks 
                         away)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
                         with you yet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I'm through with you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, 
                         "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now 
                         it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
                         pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
                         insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
                         that I do! You're always pushing me 
                         around or pushing me away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
                         bad, how come you came back?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Because that's what friends do! They 
                         forgive each other!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
                         you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
                         (goes into the outhouse and slams the 
                         door)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
                         onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
                         feelings.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Go away!

                                     DONKEY
                         There you are , doing it again just 
                         like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
                         do was like you, maybe even love you.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
                         hideous creature. I heard the two of 
                         you talking.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
                         talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't 
                         talking about me? Well, then who was 
                         she talking about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
                         You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
                         Right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) 
                         I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Right. Friends?

                                     DONKEY
                         Friends.

                                     SHREK
                         So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you asking me for? Why don't 
                         you just go ask her?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The wedding! We'll never make it in 
                         time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's 
                         a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
                         (whistles)
 
               Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
               they can climb on.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
 
                         
               They both laugh.

                                     SHREK
                         Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a 
                         noogie)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Don't get all 
                         slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
                         right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
                         had a chance to install the seat belts 
                         yet.
 
               They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.

               DULOC - CHURCH

               Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
 
               
                                     PRIEST
                         People of DuLoc, we gather here today 
                         to bear witness to the union....
 
                                     FIONA
                         (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

                                     PRIEST
                         ...of our new king...

                                     FIONA
                         Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
                         to the "I do's"?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (chuckles and then motions to the priest 
                         to indulge Fiona) Go on.
 
               COURTYARD

               Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
               a boom. The guards all take off running.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
                         If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
                         that? (she nods and goes after the guards) 
                         Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
                         wanna do this right, don't you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         (at the Church door) What are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
                         preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or 
                         forever hold your peace." That's when 
                         you say, "I object!"
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't have time for this!

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
                         to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
                         you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         You wanna hold her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing James Brown style) Then you 
                         got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
                         (normal) The chicks love that romantic 
                         crap!
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right! Cut it out. When does this 
                         guy say the line?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         We gotta check it out.

               INSIDE CHURCH

               As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
               windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
 
                                     PRIEST
                         And so, by the power vested in me...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     SHREK
                         What do you see?

                                     DONKEY
                         The whole town's in there.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         They're at the altar.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         ...king and queen.

               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, for the love of Pete!

               He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
 
               
               INSIDE CHURCH

                                     SHREK
                         (running toward the alter) I object!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek?

               The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, now what does he want?

                                     SHREK
                         (to congregation as he reaches the front 
                         of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' 
                         a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first 
                         of all. Very clean.
 
                                     FIONA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, it's rude enough being alive 
                         when no one wants you, but showing up 
                         uninvited to a wedding...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona! I need to talk to you.

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
                         late for that, so if you'll excuse me 
                         - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you can't marry him.

                                     FIONA
                         And why not?

                                     SHREK
                         Because- - Because he's just marring 
                         you so he can be king.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         He's not your true love.

                                     FIONA
                         And what do you know about true love?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
                         in love with the princess! Oh, good 
                         Lord. (laughs)
 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
               whole congregation laughs.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         An ogre and a princess!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek, is this true?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
                         my love, we're but a kiss away from 
                         our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! 
                         (puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
                         but she pulls back.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looking at the setting sun) "By night 
                         one way, by day another." (to Shrek) 
                         I wanted to show you before.
 
               She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
               She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona 
                         smiles)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
                         I order you to get that out of my sight 
                         now! Get them! Get them both!
 
               The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
               them.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This 
                         marriage is binding, and that makes 
                         me king! See? See?
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, let go of me! Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Don't just stand there, you morons.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll make you regret the day we met. 
                         I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
                         beg for death to save you!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And 
                         as for you, my wife...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll have you locked back in that tower 
                         for the rest of your days! I'm king!
 
                         
               Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I will have order! I will have perfection! 
                         I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon 
                         show up and the dragon leans down and 
                         eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
                         here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
                         (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on 
                         the edge!
 
               The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
               and falls to the ground.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
                         do they?
 
               The congregation cheers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Go ahead, Shrek.

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I - - I love you.

                                     FIONA
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I love you too.

               Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
               'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
 
               
                                     CONGREGATION
                         Aawww!

               Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
               up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
               her.
 
                                     WHISPERS
                         "Until you find true love's first kiss 
                         and then take love's true form. Take 
                         love's true form. Take love's true form."
 
                         
               Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
               and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are 
                         you all right?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, 
                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
                         to be beautiful.
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you ARE beautiful.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be 
                         a happy ending.
 
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

               THE SWAMP

               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
               singing the song.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         God bless us, every one.

                                     DONKEY
                         (as he's done singing and we fade to 
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
                         breathe. I can't breathe.

                                      LUCASFILM LTD.

                

               A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
               surface of an Art Deco design.

               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                         for sure. This is madness!

               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed!

               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
               only another robot could understand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                         this time.

               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What's that?

               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
               arms and faces.

               An explosion hits near the robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I should have known better than to 
                         trust the logic of a half-sized 
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
               around the two hapless robots.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
               tiny robot to follow him.

                                     LUKE
                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
                         waiting for?! Get in gear!

               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
               madly.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
               in a frenzied panic.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
               robot joins his companion.

                                     THREEPIO
                         At last! Where have you been?

               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're heading in this direction. 
                         What are we going to do? We'll be 
                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
                         smashed into who knows what!

               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait a minute, where are you going?

               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
                         The Death Star plans are not in the 
                         main computer.

               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
               in vain.

                                     VADER
                         Where are those transmissions you 
                         intercepted?

               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                                     VADER
                         What have you done with those plans?

                                     REBEL OFFICER
                         We intercepted no transmissions. 
                         Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
                         Were on a diplomatic mission.

                         If this is a consular ship... were 
                         is the Ambassador?

               The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
               Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
               Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
               his troops.

                                     VADER
                         Commander, tear this ship apart until 
                         you've found those plans and bring 
                         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
               troopers spots her.

                                     TROOPER
                         There she is! Set for stun!

               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with 
               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a 
               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

                                     TROOPER
                         She'll be all right. Inform Lord 
                         Vader we have a prisoner.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. 
               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into 
               the cramped four-man pod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hey, you're not permitted in there. 
                         It's restricted. You'll be deactivated 
                         for sure..

               Artoo beeps something to him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
                         you overweight glob of grease! Now 
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
               the mission he is about to perform.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Secret mission? What plans? What are 
                         you talking about? I'm not getting 
                         in there!

               Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
               and twangs angrily.

               A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
               through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm going to regret this.

               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

               On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
               robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

                                     CHIEF PILOT
                         There goes another one.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hold your fire. There are no life 
                         forms. It must have been short-
                         circuited.

               INT. LIFEPOD

               Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
               Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's funny, the damage doesn't 
                         look as bad from out here.

               Artoo beeps an assuring response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Are you sure this things safe?

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
               buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
               at Luke as he flies past.

                                     WOMAN
                         I've told you kids to slow down!

               INT. POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
               mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
               office, yelling wildly.

                                     FIXER
                         Did I hear a young noise blast through 
                         here?

                                     CAMIE
                         It was just wormie on another rampage.

               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
               background.

                                     LUKE
                         Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

               Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
               joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't know you were back! When 
                         did you get in?

                                     BIGGS
                         Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
                         hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
                         certainly didn't expect you to be 
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

                                     LUKE
                         The Academy didn't change you 
                         much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
                         what happened, didn't you get your 
                         commission?

               Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                                     BIGGS
                         Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
                         The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
                         mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...I just came to say good-bye to 
                         all you unfortunate landlocked 
                         simpletons.

               Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
               is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
               it.

                                     LUKE
                         I almost forgot. There's a battle 
                         going on! Right here in our system. 
                         Come and look!

                                     DEAK
                         Not again! Forget it.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - 
               DAY

               The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
               and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
               Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

                                     LUKE
                         There they are!

               Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
               see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
               Biggs sees two small silver specks.

                                     BIGGS
                         That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
                         just sitting there! Probably a 
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

                                     LUKE
                         But there was a lot of firing 
                         earlier...

               Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
               building in the process. Luke grabs them.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, easy with those...

                                     CAMIE
                         Don't worry about it, Wormie.

               The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
               his shoulders in resignation.

                                     FIXER
                         I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
                         a long way from here. I doubt if the 
                         Empire would even fight to keep this 
                         system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
               Luke's ineptitude.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     LEIA
                         Lord Vader, I should have known. 
                         Only you could be so bold. The 
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for 
                         this, when they hear you've attacked 
                         a diplomatic...

                                     VADER
                         Don't play games with me, Your 
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
                         mission this time. You passed directly 
                         through a restricted system. Several 
                         transmissions were beamed to this 
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
                         what happened to the plans they sent 
                         you.

                                     LEIA
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
                         Alderaan...

                                     VADER
                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
               turns to Vader.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
                         this gets out, it could generate 
                         sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
                         senate.

                                     VADER
                         I have traced the Rebel spies to 
                         her. Now she is my only link to find 
                         their secret base!

                                     COMMANDER
                         She'll die before she tells you 
                         anything.

                                     VADER
                         Leave that to me. Send a distress 
                         signal and then inform the senate 
                         that all aboard were killed!

               Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
               They stop and snap to attention.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
                         are not aboard this ship! And no 
                         transmissions were made. An escape 
                         pod was jettisoned during the 
                         fighting, but no life forms were 
                         aboard.

               Vader turns to the Commander.

                                     VADER
                         She must have hidden the plans in 
                         the escape pod. Send a detachment 
                         down to retrieve them. See to it 
                         personally, Commander. There'll be 
                         no one to stop us this time.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Yes, sir.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
               planet Tatooine.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

               Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
               meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
               work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         How did I get into this mess? I really 
                         don't know how. We seem to be made 
                         to suffer. It's our lot in life.

               Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
                         My joints are almost frozen.

               Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What a desolate place this is.

               Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
               stops and yells at him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where are you going?

               A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
               robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
                         much too rocky. This way is much 
                         easier.

               Artoo counters with a long whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What makes you think there are 
                         settlements over there?

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't get technical with me.

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What mission? What are you talking 
                         about? I've had just about enough of 
                         you! Go that way! You'll be 
                         malfunctioning within a day, you 
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
               direction of the vast dune sea.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And don't let me catch you following 
                         me begging for help, because you 
                         won't get it.

               Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No more adventures. I'm not going 
                         that way.

               Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
               mountains.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

               Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
               miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
               rock mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That malfunctioning little twerp. 
                         This is all his fault! He tricked me 
                         into going this way, but he'll do no 
                         better.

               In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
               from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
               towards him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
                         saved!

               The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
               approaching transport.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Over here! Help! Please, help!

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                                     LUKE
                              (Very animated)
                         ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
                         the afterburners and came in low on 
                         Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
                         I was going to fry my instruments. 
                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
                         upset. He grounded me for the rest 
                         of the season. You should have been 
                         there... it was fantastic.

                                     BIGGS
                         You ought to take it easy Luke. You 
                         may be the hottest bushpilot this 
                         side of Mos Eisley, but those little 
                         Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it 
                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going 
                         to be nothing more than a dark spot 
                         on the down side of a canyon wall.

                                     LUKE
                         Look who's talking. Now that you've 
                         been around those giant starships 
                         you're beginning to sound like my 
                         uncle. You've gotten soft in the 
                         city...

                                     BIGGS
                         I've missed you kid.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, things haven't been the same 
                         since you left, Biggs. It's been 
                         so... quiet.

               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke, I didn't come back just to say 
                         good-bye... I shouldn't tell you 
                         this, but you're the only one I can 
                         trust... and if I don't come back, I 
                         want somebody to know.

               Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BIGGS
                         I made some friends at the Academy.
                              (he whispers)
                         ...when our frigate goes to one of 
                         the central systems, we're going to 
                         jump ship and join the Alliance...

               Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                                     LUKE
                         Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! 
                         How?

                                     BIGGS
                         Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth 
                         bigger than a meteor crater!

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
                              (he whispers)
                         Listen how quiet I am. You can barely 
                         hear me...

               Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                                     BIGGS
                         My friend has a friend on Bestine 
                         who might help us make contact.

                                     LUKE
                         You're crazy! You could wander around 
                         forever trying to find them.

                                     BIGGS
                         I know it's a long shot, but if I 
                         don't find them I'll do what I can 
                         on my own... It's what we always 
                         talked about. Luke, I'm not going to 
                         wait for the Empire to draft me into 
                         service. The Rebellion is spreading 
                         and I want to be on the right side -- 
                         the side I believe in.

                                     LUKE
                         And I'm stuck here...

                                     BIGGS
                         I thought you were going to the 
                         Academy next term. You'll get your 
                         chance to get off this rock.

                                     LUKE
                         Not likely! I had to cancel my 
                         application. There has been a lot of 
                         unrest among the Sandpeople since 
                         you left... they've even raided the 
                         outskirts of Anchorhead.

                                     BIGGS
                         Your uncle could hold off a whole 
                         colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.

                                     LUKE
                         I know, but he's got enough vaporators 
                         going to make the place pay off. He 
                         needs me for just one more season. I 
                         can't leave him now.

                                     BIGGS
                         I feel for you, Luke, you're going 
                         to have to learn what seems to be 
                         important or what really is important. 
                         What good is all your uncle's work 
                         if it's taken over by the Empire?... 
                         You know they're starting to 
                         nationalize commerce in the central 
                         systems... it won't be long before 
                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving 
                         for the greater glory of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         It couldn't happen here. You said it 
                         yourself. The Empire won't bother 
                         with this rock.

                                     BIGGS
                         Things always change.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I was going... Are you going 
                         to be around long?

                                     BIGGS
                         No, I'm leaving in the morning...

                                     LUKE
                         Then I guess I won't see you.

                                     BIGGS
                         Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll be at the Academy next 
                         season... after that who knows. I 
                         won't be drafted into the Imperial 
                         Starfleet that's for sure... Take 
                         care of yourself, you'll always be 
                         the best friend I've got.

                                     BIGGS
                         So long, Luke.

               Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the 
               power station.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
               narrow path.

               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
               the trail.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
               of the chamber.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
               out from the gloom.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
               ridge.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
                         go off in this direction.

               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
               and gives it to the first trooper.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Look, sir -- droids.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER

               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wake up! Wake up!

               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
               odd assortment of robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed.

               A Jawa starts moving toward them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Do you think they'll melt us down?

               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
                         never end?

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
               adobe block house.

               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
               should be.

               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
               standing in the main courtyard.

                                     BERU
                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like we don't have much of 
                         a choice but I'll remind him.

               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
               for sale with the Jawa leader.

                                     OWEN
                         I have no need for a protocol droid.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (quickly)
                         Sir -- not in an environment such as 
                         this -- that's why I've also been 
                         programmed for over thirty secondary 
                         functions that...

                                     OWEN
                         What I really need is a droid that 
                         understands the binary language of 
                         moisture vaporators.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was 
                         programming binary load lifter... 
                         very similar to your vaporators. You 
                         could say...

                                     OWEN
                         Do you speak Bocce?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
                         second language for me... I'm as 
                         fluent in Bocce...

                                     OWEN
                         All right shut up!
                              (turning to Jawa)
                         I'll take this one.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Shutting up, sir.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, take these two over to the 
                         garage, will you? I want you to have 
                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

                                     LUKE
                         But I was going into Toshi Station 
                         to pick up some power converters...

                                     OWEN
                         You can waste time with your friends 
                         when your chores are done. Now come 
                         on, get to it!

                                     LUKE
                         All right, come on! And the red one, 
                         come on. Well, come on, Red, let's 
                         go.

               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. 
                         Look!

                                     OWEN
                              (to the head Jawa)
                         Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                         us?

               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
               Luke on the shoulder.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (pointing to Artoo)
                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
                         in prime condition. A real bargain.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         What about that one?

                                     OWEN
                              (to Jawa)
                         What about that blue one? We'll take 
                         that one.

               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
               astro-droid for Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, take it away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
                         pleased with that one, sir. He really 
                         is in first-class condition. I've 
                         worked with him before. Here he comes.

               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay, let's go.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
                         should stick my neck out for you is 
                         quite beyond my capacity!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
               with a cord to his face.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
                         going to feel so good. I've got such 
                         a bad case of dust contamination, I 
                         can barely move!

               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

                                     LUKE
                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
                         right. I'm never gonna get out of 
                         here!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Is there anything I might do to help?

               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, not unless you can alter time, 
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
                         off this rock!

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
                         droid and not very knowledgeable 
                         about such things. Not on this planet, 
                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
                         not even sure which planet I'm on.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, if there's a bright center to 
                         the universe, you're on the planet 
                         that it's farthest from.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Uh, you can call me Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir Luke.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Just Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
                         relations, and this is my counterpart, 
                         Artoo-Detoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hello.

               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
               oil from his bronze body.

                                     LUKE
                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
                         It looks like you boys have seen a 
                         lot of action.

                                     THREEPIO
                         With all we've been through, sometimes 
                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
                         as we are, what with the Rebellion 
                         and all.

                                     LUKE
                         You know of the Rebellion against 
                         the Empire?

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's how we came to be in your 
                         service, if you take my meaning, 
                         sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Have you been in many battles?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Several, I think. Actually, there's 
                         not much to tell. I'm not much more 
                         than an interpreter, and not very 
                         good at telling stories. Well, not 
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, my little friend, you've got 
                         something jammed in here real good. 
                         Were you on a cruiser or...

               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope.

                                     LUKE
                         What's this?

               Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
               to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
               over and over.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What is what?!? He asked you a 
                         question...
                              (pointing to Leia)
                         What is that?

               Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
               the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
               sentence fragment over and over.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
                         You're my only hope.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
                         mind.

               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                                     LUKE
                         Who is she? She's beautiful.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

                                     THREEPIO
                         I think she was a passenger on our 
                         last voyage. A person of some 
                         importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
                         captain was attached to...

                                     LUKE
                         Is there more to this recording?

               Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
               squeaks and a whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
                         to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
                         you can trust him. He's our new 
                         master.

               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
                         And it's a private message for him. 
                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
                         he's talking about. Our last master 
                         was Captain Antilles, but with what 
                         we've been through, this little R2 
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

                                     LUKE
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
                         old Ben Kenobi?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
                         know what he's talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                         Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
                         the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
                         old hermit.

               Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
               moments.

                                     LUKE
                         I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
                         she's in trouble. I'd better play 
                         back the whole thing.

               Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says the restraining bolt has 
                         short circuited his recording system. 
                         He suggests that if you remove the 
                         bolt, he might be able to play back 
                         the entire recording.

               Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
               really heard what Threepio has been saying.

                                     LUKE
                         H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
                         too small to run away on me if I 
                         take this off! Okay.

               Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
               Artoo's side.

                                     LUKE
                         There you go.

               The princess immediately disappears...

                                     LUKE
                         Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
                         Bring her back! Play back the entire 
                         message.

               Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
               embarrassment.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What message? The one you're carrying 
                         inside your rusty innards!

               A women's voice calls out from another room.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

               Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
               robot.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
                         Beru.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
               hurries out of the room.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, see what you can do with him. 
                         I'll be right back.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Just you reconsider playing that 
                         message for him.

               Artoo beeps in response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't think he likes you at 
                         all.

               Artoo beeps.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't like you either.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

               Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
               steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
               grain.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, I think that R2 unit we 
                         bought might have been stolen.

                                     OWEN
                         What makes you think that?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I stumbled across a recording 
                         while I was cleaning him. He says he 
                         belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi.

               Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
               manages to control himself.

                                     LUKE
                         I thought he might have meant old 
                         Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
                         about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
                         to Ben.

               Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                                     OWEN
                         That old man's just a crazy old 
                         wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
                         that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
                         have its memory flushed. That'll be 
                         the end of it. It belongs to us now.

                                     LUKE
                         But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
                         for him?

                                     OWEN
                         He won't, I don't think he exists 
                         any more. He died about the same 
                         time as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         He knew my father?

                                     OWEN
                         I told you to forget it. Your only 
                         concern is to prepare the new droids 
                         for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
                         them on the south ridge working out 
                         those condensers.

                                     LUKE
                         Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
                         are going to work out fine. In fact, 
                         I, uh, was also thinking about our 
                         agreement about my staying on another 
                         season. And if these new droids do 
                         work out, I want to transmit my 
                         application to the Academy this year.

               Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
               it.

                                     OWEN
                         You mean the next semester before 
                         harvest?

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, there're more than enough 
                         droids.

                                     OWEN
                         Harvest is when I need you the most. 
                         Only one more season. This year we'll 
                         make enough on the harvest so I'll 
                         be able to hire some more hands. And 
                         then you can go to the Academy next 
                         year.

               Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

                                     OWEN
                         You must understand I need you here, 
                         Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         But it's a whole 'nother year.

                                     OWEN
                         Look, it's only one more season.

               Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, that's what you said last year 
                         when Biggs and Tank left.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Where are you going?

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
               mechanically finishes his dinner.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
                         Most of his friends have gone. It 
                         means so much to him.

                                     OWEN
                         I'll make it up to him next year. I 
                         promise.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
                         has too much of his father in him.

                                     OWEN
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
               distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
               homestead.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

               Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
               sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
               similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
               box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
               short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you doing hiding there?

               Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
               sight.

                                     THREEPIO
                         It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
                         deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
               salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
               electrobinoculars.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That R2 unit has always been a 
                         problem. These astro-droids are 
                         getting quite out of hand. Even I 
                         can't understand their logic at times.

                                     LUKE
                         How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
                         in sight. Blast it!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
                         after him?

                                     LUKE
                         It's too dangerous with all the 
                         Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
                         wait until morning.

               Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
                         for the night.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be there in a few 
                         minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

               He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                                     LUKE
                         You know that little droid is going 
                         to cause me a lot of trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he excels at that, sir.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

               Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
               the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
               Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
                         loafing now!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

               The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
               prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

                                     OWEN
                         Have you seen Luke this morning?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         He said he had some things to do 
                         before he started today, so he left 
                         early.

                                     OWEN
                         Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
                         with him?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         I think so.

                                     OWEN
                         Well, he'd better have those units 
                         in the south range repaired be midday 
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

               The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
               pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
               wasteland.

               INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - 
               DAY

               Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
               in the motor compartment.

                                     LUKE
                              (yelling)
                         How's that.

               Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                                     LUKE
                         Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this 
                         direction somewhere, but I don't see 
                         how that R2 unit could have come 
                         this far. We must have missed him. 
                         Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
                         very well.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, would it help if you told him 
                         it was my fault.

                                     LUKE
                              (brightening)
                         Sure. He needs you. He'd probably 
                         only deactivate you for a day or 
                         so...

                                     THREEPIO
                         Deactivate! Well, on the other hand 
                         if you hadn't removed his restraining 
                         bolt...

                                     LUKE
                         Wait, there's something dead ahead 
                         on the scanner. It looks like our 
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

               From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
               gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
               two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
               the gun before it can be fired.

               The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
               animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

               The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
               to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
               as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

               The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
               before little Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
                         you're going?

               The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke here is your rightful 
                         owner. We'll have no more of this 
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
                         talk to me about your mission, either. 
                         You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, come on. It's getting late. I 
                         only hope we can get back before 
                         Uncle Owen really blows up.

                                     THREEPIO
                         If you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                         I think you should deactivate the 
                         little fugitive until you've gotten 
                         him back to your workshop.

                                     LUKE
                         No, he's not going to try anything.

               Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
               whistles and screams.

                                     LUKE
                         What's wrong with him now?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh my... sir, he says there are 
                         several creatures approaching from 
                         the southeast.

               Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                                     LUKE
                         Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
                         have a look. Come on.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
               adventurer.

                                     LUKE
                         There are two Banthas down there but 
                         I don't see any... wait a second, 
                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
                         see one of them now.

               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
               down the side of the mountain.

               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
               shrieking laugh.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

                                     BEN
                         Hello there! Come here my little 
                         friend. Don't be afraid.

               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
               Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

                                     BEN
                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                                     LUKE
                         What happened?

                                     BEN
                         Rest easy, son, you've had a busy 
                         day. You're fortunate you're still 
                         in one piece.

                                     LUKE
                         Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to 
                         see you!

                                     BEN
                         The Jundland wastes are not to be 
                         traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, 
                         what brings you out this far?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, this little droid! I think he's 
                         searching for his former master... 
                         I've never seen such devotion in a 
                         droid before... there seems to be no 
                         stopping him. He claims to be the 
                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
                         a relative of yours? Do you know who 
                         he's talking about?

               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

                                     BEN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats 
                         a name I haven't heard in a long 
                         time... a long time.

                                     LUKE
                         I think my uncle knew him. He said 
                         he was dead.

                                     BEN
                         Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know him!

                                     BEN
                         Well of course, of course I know 
                         him. He's me! I haven't gone by the 
                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you 
                         were born.

                                     LUKE
                         Then the droid does belong to you.

                                     BEN
                         Don't seem to remember ever owning a 
                         droid. Very interesting...

               He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

                                     BEN
                         I think we better get indoors. The 
                         Sandpeople are easily startled but 
                         they will soon be back and in greater 
                         numbers.

               Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio!

               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins 
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
               the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where am I? I must have taken a bad 
                         step...

                                     LUKE
                         Can you stand? We've got to get out 
                         of here before the Sandpeople return.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think I can make it. You go 
                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in 
                         you risking yourself on my account. 
                         I'm done for.

               Artoo makes a beeping sound.

                                     LUKE
                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is 
                         that?

               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
               air.

                                     BEN
                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.

               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
               old Ben sits thinking.

                                     LUKE
                         No, my father didn't fight in the 
                         wars. He was a navigator on a spice 
                         freighter.

                                     BEN
                         That's what your uncle told you. He 
                         didn't hold with your father's ideals. 
                         Thought he should have stayed here 
                         and not gotten involved.

                                     LUKE
                         You fought in the Clone Wars?

                                     BEN
                         Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the 
                         same as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I'd known him.

                                     BEN
                         He was the best star-pilot in the 
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I 
                         understand you've become quite a 
                         good pilot yourself. And he was a 
                         good friend. Which reminds me...

               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                                     BEN
                         I have something here for you. Your 
                         father wanted you to have this when 
                         you were old enough, but your uncle 
                         wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some 
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like 
                         your father did.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 
                         I'll close down for awhile.

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, go ahead.

               Ben hands Luke the saber.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     BEN
                         Your fathers lightsaber. This is the 
                         weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy 
                         or as random as a blaster.

               Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across 
               the ceiling.

                                     BEN
                         An elegant weapon for a more civilized 
                         time. For over a thousand generations 
                         the Jedi Knights were the guardians 
                         of peace and justice in the Old 
                         Republic. Before the dark times, 
                         before the Empire.

               Luke hasn't really been listening.

                                     LUKE
                         How did my father die?

                                     BEN
                         A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who 
                         was a pupil of mine until he turned 
                         to evil, helped the Empire hunt down 
                         and destroy the Jedi Knights. He 
                         betrayed and murdered your father. 
                         Now the Jedi are all but extinct. 
                         Vader was seduced by the dark side 
                         of the Force.

                                     LUKE
                         The Force?

                                     BEN
                         Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi 
                         his power. It's an energy field 
                         created by all living things. It 
                         surrounds us and penetrates us. It 
                         binds the galaxy together.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     BEN
                         Now, let's see if we can't figure 
                         out what you are, my little friend. 
                         And where you come from.

                                     LUKE
                         I saw part of the message he was...

               Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful 
               young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                                     BEN
                         I seem to have found it.

               Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before 
               his eyes.

                                     LEIA
                         General Kenobi, years ago you served 
                         my father in the Clone Wars. Now he 
                         begs you to help him in his struggle 
                         against the Empire. I regret that I 
                         am unable to present my father's 
                         request to you in person, but my 
                         ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
                         afraid my mission to bring you to 
                         Alderaan has failed. I have placed 
                         information vital to the survival of 
                         the Rebellion into the memory systems 
                         of this R2 unit. My father will know 
                         how to retrieve it. You must see 
                         this droid safely delivered to him 
                         on Alderaan. This is our most 
                         desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, you're my only hope.

               There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
               Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

                                     BEN
                         You must learn the ways of the Force 
                         if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. 
                         I've got to go home. It's late, I'm 
                         in for it as it is.

                                     BEN
                         I need your help, Luke. She needs 
                         your help. I'm getting too old for 
                         this sort of thing.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't get involved! I've got work 
                         to do! It's not that I like the 
                         Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing 
                         I can do about it right now. It's 
                         such a long way from here.

                                     BEN
                         That's your uncle talking.

                                     LUKE
                              (sighing)
                         Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever 
                         going to explain this?

                                     BEN
                         Learn about the Force, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Look, I can take you as far as 
                         Anchorhead. You can get a transport 
                         there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're 
                         going.

                                     BEN
                         You must do what you feel is right, 
                         of course.

               EXT. SPACE.

               An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like 
               battle station: the Death Star!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black 
               conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around 
               the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, 
               is speaking.

                                     TAGGE
                         Until this battle station is fully 
                         operational we are vulnerable. The 
                         Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
                         They're more dangerous than you 
                         realize.

               The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

                                     MOTTI
                         Dangerous to your starfleet, 
                         Commander, not to this battle station!

                                     TAGGE
                         The Rebellion will continue to gain 
                         a support in the Imperial Senate as 
                         long as....

               Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
               short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
               outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
               The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
               place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
               him.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Imperial Senate will no longer 
                         be of any concern to us. I've just 
                         received word that the Emperor has 
                         dissolved the council permanently. 
                         The last remnants of the Old Republic 
                         have been swept away.

                                     TAGGE
                         That's impossible! How will the 
                         Emperor maintain control without the 
                         bureaucracy?

                                     TARKIN
                         The regional governors now have direct 
                         control over territories. Fear will 
                         keep the local systems in line. Fear 
                         of this battle station.

                                     TAGGE
                         And what of the Rebellion? If the 
                         Rebels have obtained a complete 
                         technical readout of this station, 
                         it is possible, however unlikely, 
                         that they might find a weakness and 
                         exploit it.

                                     VADER
                         The plans you refer to will soon be 
                         back in our hands.

                                     MOTTI
                         Any attack made by the Rebels against 
                         this station would be a useless 
                         gesture, no matter what technical 
                         data they've obtained. This station 
                         is now the ultimate power in the 
                         universe. I suggest we use it!

                                     VADER
                         Don't be too proud of this 
                         technological terror you've 
                         constructed. The ability to destroy 
                         a planet is insignificant next to 
                         the power of the Force.

                                     MOTTI
                         Don't try to frighten us with your 
                         sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your 
                         sad devotion to that ancient religion 
                         has not helped you conjure up the 
                         stolen data tapes, or given you 
                         clairvoyance enough to find the 
                         Rebel's hidden fort...

               Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's 
               spell.

                                     VADER
                         I find your lack of faith disturbing.

                                     TARKIN
                         Enough of this! Vader, release him!

                                     VADER
                         As you wish.

                                     TARKIN
                         This bickering is pointless. Lord 
                         Vader will provide us with the 
                         location of the Rebel fortress by 
                         the time this station is operational. 
                         We will then crush the Rebellion 
                         with one swift stroke.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
               Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
               and scattered bodies.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
                         all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
                         sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
                         I never heard of them hitting anything 
                         this big before.

               Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                                     BEN
                         They didn't. But we are meant to 
                         think they did. These tracks are 
                         side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
                         single file to hide there numbers.

                                     LUKE
                         These are the same Jawas that sold 
                         us Artoo and Threepio.

                                     BEN
                         And these blast points, too accurate 
                         for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
                         stormtroopers are so precise.

                                     LUKE
                         Why would Imperial troops want to 
                         slaughter Jawas?

               Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
               inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

                                     LUKE
                         If they traced the robots here, they 
                         may have learned who they sold them 
                         to. And that would lead them home!

               Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
               the speeder and jumps it.

                                     BEN
                         Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

               Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
               burning Sandcrawler.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps 
               out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
               Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
               battle has taken place.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

               Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. 
               Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
               stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new 
               resolve comes over him.

               EXT. SPACE

               Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow 
               several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
               filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
               giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                                     VADER
                         And, now Your Highness, we will 
                         discuss the location of your hidden 
                         Rebel base.

               The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
               approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
               arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
               and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
               screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
               the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
               dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
               him.

                                     BEN
                         There's nothing you could have done, 
                         Luke, had you been there. You'd have 
                         been killed, too, and the droids 
                         would be in the hands of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to come with you to Alderaan. 
                         There's nothing here for me now. I 
                         want to learn the ways of the Force 
                         and become a Jedi like my father.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
               zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
               Ben is standing.

                                     BEN
                         Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never 
                         find a more wretched hive of scum 
                         and villainy. We must be cautious.

               Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
               smile.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
               hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
               questions Luke.

                                     TROOPER
                         How long have you had these droids?

                                     LUKE
                         About three or four seasons.

                                     BEN
                         They're for sale if you want them.

                                     TROOPER
                         Let me see your identification.

               Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
               Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                                     BEN
                         You don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     TROOPER
                         We don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     BEN
                         These are not the droids your looking 
                         for.

                                     TROOPER
                         These are not the droids we're looking 
                         for.

                                     BEN
                         He can go about his business.

                                     TROOPER
                         You can go about your business.

                                     BEN
                              (to Luke)
                         Move along.

                                     TROOPER
                         Move along. Move along.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
               on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
               parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
               the speeder.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting 
                         creatures.

               As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
               away.

                                     LUKE
                         Go on, go on. I can't understand how 
                         we got by those troopers. I thought 
                         we were dead.

                                     BEN
                         The Force can have a strong influence 
                         on the weak-minded. You will find it 
                         a powerful ally.

                                     LUKE
                         Do you really think we're going to 
                         find a pilot here that'll take us to 
                         Alderaan?

                                     BEN
                         Well, most of the best freighter 
                         pilots can be found here. Only watch 
                         your step. This place can be a little 
                         rough.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm ready for anything.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come along, Artoo.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
               stops Luke and the robots.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We don't serve their kind here!

               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
               drift.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Your droids. They'll have to wait 
                         outside. We don't want them here.

               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                                     LUKE
                         Listen, why don't you wait out by 
                         the speeder. We don't want any 
                         trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I heartily agree with you sir.

               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
               sight to behold.

               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
               Ben and the giant Wookiee.

               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
               or whatever.

               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

                                     CREATURE
                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
               belligerent monstrosity.

                                     HUMAN
                         He doesn't like you.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HUMAN
                         I don't like you either.

               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
               adventurer.

                                     HUMAN
                         Don't insult us. You just watch 
                         yourself. We're wanted men. I have 
                         the death sentence in twelve systems.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll be careful than.

                                     HUMAN
                         You'll be dead.

               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
               Luke.

                                     BEN
                         This little one isn't worth the 
                         effort. Come let me buy you 
                         something...

               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
               The bartender panics.

                                     BARTENDER
                         No blasters! No blaster!

               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
               points the the Wookiee.

                                     BEN
                         This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate 
                         on a ship that might suit our needs.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
               an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
               droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
               two stormtroopers in the street.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't like the look of this.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
               instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
               follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
               sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
               old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
               and cocksure.

                                     HAN
                         Han Solo. I'm captain of the 
                         Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells 
                         me you're looking for passage to the 
                         Alderaan system.

                                     BEN
                         Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

                                     HAN
                         Fast ship? You've never heard of the 
                         Millennium Falcon?

                                     BEN
                         Should I have?

                                     HAN
                         It's the ship that made the Kessel 
                         run in less than twelve parsecs!

               Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
               obvious misinformation.

                                     HAN
                         I've outrun Imperial starships, not 
                         the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. 
                         I'm talking about the big Corellian 
                         ships now. She's fast enough for 
                         you, old man. What's the cargo?

                                     BEN
                         Only passengers. Myself, the boy, 
                         two droids, and no questions asked.

                                     HAN
                         What is it? Some kind of local 
                         trouble?

                                     BEN
                         Let's just say we'd like to avoid 
                         any Imperial entanglements.

                                     HAN
                         Well, that's the trick, isn't it? 
                         And it's going to cost you something 
                         extra. Ten thousand in advance.

                                     LUKE
                         Ten thousand? We could almost buy 
                         our own ship for that!

                                     HAN
                         But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

                                     LUKE
                         You bet I could. I'm not such a bad 
                         pilot myself! We don't have to sit 
                         here and listen...

                                     BEN
                         We haven't that much with us. But we 
                         could pay you two thousand now, plus 
                         fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen, huh!

               Han ponders this for a few moments.

                                     HAN
                         Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. 
                         We'll leave as soon as you're ready. 
                         Docking bay Ninety-four.

                                     BEN
                         Ninety-four.

                                     HAN
                         Looks like somebody's beginning to 
                         take an interest in your handiwork.

               Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
               looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
               questions. The bartender points to the booth.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, we'll check it out.

               The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben 
               are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen thousand! Those guys must 
                         really be desperate. This could really 
                         save my neck. Get back to the ship 
                         and get her ready.

                         That's okay. I'm never coming back 
                         to this planet again.

               INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
               with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
               speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

                                     GREEDO
                         Going somewhere, Solo?

                                     HAN
                         Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
                         was just going to see your boss. 
                         Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

               Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
               gun on him.

                                     GREEDO
                         It's too late. You should have paid 
                         him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
                         put a price on your head, so large 
                         that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
                         will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
                         found you first.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, but this time I got the money.

                                     GREEDO
                         If you give it to me, I might forget 
                         I found you.

                                     HAN
                         I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

                                     GREEDO
                         Jabba's through with you. He has no 
                         time for smugglers who drop their 
                         shipments at the first sign of an 
                         Imperial cruiser.

                                     HAN
                         Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you 
                         think I had a choice?

               Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

                                     GREEDO
                         You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
                         only take your ship.

                                     HAN
                         Over my dead body.

                                     GREEDO
                         That's the idea. I've been looking 
                         forward to killing you for a long 
                         time.

                                     HAN
                         Yes, I'll bet you have.

               Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
               light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
               the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
               and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
               coins as he leaves.

                                     HAN
                         Sorry about the mess.

                         Perhaps she would respond to an 
                         alternative form of persuasion.

                         I think it is time we demonstrate 
                         the full power of this station.

                                     TROOPER
                         With pleasure.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a 
               narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking 
               exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and 
               robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and 
               hiding from the hot winds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Lock the door, Artoo.

               One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves 
               on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and 
               Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, check that side of the 
                         street. It's secure. Move on to the 
                         next door.

               The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I would much rather have gone with 
                         Master Luke than stay here with you. 
                         I don't know what all the trouble is 
                         about, but I'm sure it must be your 
                         fault.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You watch your language!

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED 
               SPEEDER LOT

               Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, 
               talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder 
               dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass 
               by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

                                     LUKE
                         He says it's the best he can do. 
                         Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
                         just not in demand.

                                     BEN
                         It will be enough.

               Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
               alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
               creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
               faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
               moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
               they disappear down another alley.

                                     BEN
                         If the ship's as fast as he's 
                         boasting, we ought to do well.

               INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

               Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
               creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
               the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
               a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
               a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
               a huge ugly mouth.

                                     JABBA
                         Come on out, Solo!

               A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
               they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
               Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                                     HAN
                         I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

                                     JABBA
                         I expected you would be.

                                     HAN
                         I'm not the type to run.

                                     JABBA
                              (fatherly-smooth)
                         Han, my boy, there are times when 
                         you disappoint me... why haven't you 
                         paid me? And why did you have to fry 
                         poor Greedo like that... after all 
                         we've been through together.

                                     HAN
                         You sent Greedo to blast me.

                                     JABBA
                              (mock surprise)
                         Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
                         the business. You're too valuable to 
                         fry. He was only relaying my concern 
                         at your delays. He wasn't going to 
                         blast you.

                                     HAN
                         I think he thought he was. Next time 
                         don't send one of those twerps. If 
                         you've got something to say to me, 
                         come see me yourself.

                                     JABBA
                         Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to 
                         dump that shipment of spice... you 
                         understand I just can't make an 
                         exception. Where would I be if every 
                         pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
                         their shipment at the first sign of 
                         an Imperial starship? It's not good 
                         business.

                                     HAN
                         You know, even I get boarded 
                         sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
                         but I've got a charter now and I can 
                         pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
                         just need some more time.

                                     JABBA
                              (to his men)
                         Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
                         I'm only doing this because you're 
                         the best and I need you. So, for an 
                         extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
                         you a little more time... but this 
                         is it. If you disappoint me again, 
                         I'll put a price on your head so 
                         large you won't be able to go near a 
                         civilized system for the rest of 
                         your short life.

                                     HAN
                         Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my 
                         pleasure.

               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

               Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
               94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
               Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
               The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
               lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
               transmitter.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
               Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
               large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
               could only loosely be called a starship.

                                     LUKE
                         What a piece of junk.

               The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                                     HAN
                         She'll make point five beyond the 
                         speed of light. She may not look 
                         like much, but she's got it where it 
                         counts, kid. I've added some special 
                         modifications myself.

               Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
               all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
               to follow.

                                     HAN
                         We're a little rushed, so if you'll 
                         hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

               The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han 
               Solo.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty 
               engines of the starship.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium 
               Falcon passing Solo.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hello, sir.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad 
               creature.

                                     TROOPER
                         Which way?

               The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking 
               bay.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, men. Load your weapons!

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]

               The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the 
               docking bay entrance.

                                     TROOPER
                         Stop that ship!

               Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
               into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
               he ducks into the spaceship.

                                     TROOPER
                         Blast 'em!

               Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
               which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
               pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that 
               slams the overhead entry shut.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

                                     HAN
                         Chewie, get us out of here!

               The group straps in for take off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I 
                         hate space travel.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general 
               alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above 
               the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the 
               morning sky.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who 
               chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.  
               Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, 
               makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                                     HAN
                         It looks like an Imperial cruiser. 
                         Our passengers must be hotter than I 
                         thought. Try and hold them off. Angle 
                         the deflector shield while I make 
                         the calculations for the jump to 
                         light speed.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow 
               planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial 
               stardestroyers.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy 
               spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
               cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

                                     HAN
                         Stay sharp! There are two more coming 
                         in; they're going to try to cut us 
                         off.

                                     LUKE
                         Why don't you outrun them? I thought 
                         you said this thing was fast.

                                     HAN
                         Watch your mouth, kid, or you're 
                         going to find yourself floating home. 
                         We'll be safe enough once we make 
                         the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I 
                         know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 
                         them!

               Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

               The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

                                     HAN
                         Here's where the fun begins!

                                     BEN
                         How long before you can make the 
                         jump to light speed?

                                     HAN
                         It'll take a few moments to get the 
                         coordinates from the navi-computer.

               The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you kidding? At the rate they're 
                         gaining...

                                     HAN
                         Traveling through hyperspace isn't 
                         like dusting crops, boy! Without 
                         precise calculations we could fly 
                         right through a star or bounce too 
                         close to a supernova and that'd end 
                         your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

               The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red 
               warning light begins to flash.

                                     LUKE
                         What's that flashing?

                                     HAN
                         We're losing our deflector shield. 
                         Go strap yourself in, I'm going to 
                         make the jump to light speed.

               The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
               crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship 
               makes the jump to hyperspace.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a 
               second.

               EXT. DEATH STAR

               Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before 
               Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen 
               displaying a small green planet.

                                     MOTTI
                         We've entered the Alderaan system.

               Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her 
               hands are bound.

                                     LEIA
                         Governor Tarkin, I should have 
                         expected to find you holding Vader's 
                         leash. I recognized your foul stench 
                         when I was brought on board.

                                     TARKIN
                         Charming to the last. You don't know 
                         how hard I found it signing the order 
                         to terminate your life!

                                     LEIA
                         I surprised you had the courage to 
                         take the responsibility yourself!

                                     TARKIN
                         Princess Leia, before your execution 
                         I would like you to be my guest at a 
                         ceremony that will make this battle 
                         station operational. No star system 
                         will dare oppose the Emperor now.

                                     LEIA
                         The more you tighten your grip, 
                         Tarkin, the more star systems will 
                         slip through your fingers.

                                     TARKIN
                         Not after we demonstrate the power 
                         of this station. In a way, you have 
                         determined the choice of the planet 
                         that'll be destroyed first. Since 
                         you are reluctant to provide us with 
                         the location of the Rebel base, I 
                         have chosen to test this station's 
                         destructive power... on your home 
                         planet of Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                         No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
                         weapons. You can't possibly...

                                     TARKIN
                         You would prefer another target? A 
                         military target? Then name the system!

               Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

                                     TARKIN
                         I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
                         be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
                         base?

               Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
               Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                              (softly)
                         Dantooine.

               Leia lowers her head.

                                     LEIA
                         They're on Dantooine.

                                     TARKIN
                         There. You see Lord Vader, she can 
                         be reasonable.
                              (addressing Motti)
                         Continue with the operation. You may 
                         fire when ready.

                                     LEIA
                         What?

                                     TARKIN
                         You're far too trusting. Dantooine 
                         is too remote to make an effective 
                         demonstration. But don't worry. We 
                         will deal with your Rebel friends 
                         soon enough.

                                     LEIA
                         No!

               INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

                                     VADER
                         Commence primary ignition.

               A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
               hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
               Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
               lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
               huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
               and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. 
               The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" 
               robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
               seems almost faint.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you all right? What's wrong?

                                     BEN
                         I felt a great disturbance in the 
                         Force... as if millions of voices 
                         suddenly cried out in terror and 
                         were suddenly silenced. I fear 
                         something terrible has happened.

               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
               he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                                     BEN
                         You'd better get on with your 
                         exercises.

               Han Solo enters the room.

                                     HAN
                         Well, you can forget your troubles 
                         with those Imperial slugs. I told 
                         you I'd outrun 'em.

               Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                                     HAN
                         Don't everyone thank me at once.

               Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a 
               game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move 
               along a chess-type board.

                                     HAN
                         Anyway, we should be at Alderaan 
                         about oh-two-hundred hours.

               Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
               covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
               covered arms over his head.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Now be careful, Artoo.

               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
               stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He made a fair move. Screaming about 
                         it won't help you.

                                     HAN
                              (interrupting)
                         Let him have it. It's not wise to 
                         upset a Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         But sir, nobody worries about 
                         upsetting a droid.

                                     HAN
                         That's 'cause droids don't pull 
                         people's arms out of their socket 
                         when they lose. Wookiees are known 
                         to do that.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see your point, sir. I suggest a 
                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee 
                         win.

               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
               Han watches with a bit of smugness.

                                     BEN
                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force 
                         flowing through him.

                                     LUKE
                         You mean it controls your actions?

                                     BEN
                         Partially. But it also obeys your 
                         commands.

               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
               "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing 
               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

                                     HAN
                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons 
                         are no match for a good blaster at 
                         your side, kid.

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe in the Force, do 
                         you?

                                     HAN
                         Kid, I've flown from one side of 
                         this galaxy to the other. I've seen 
                         a lot of strange stuff, but I've 
                         never seen anything to make me believe 
                         there's one all-powerful force 
                         controlling everything. There's no 
                         mystical energy field that controls 
                         my destiny.

               Ben smiles quietly.

                                     HAN
                         It's all a lot of simple tricks and 
                         nonsense.

                                     BEN
                         I suggest you try it again, Luke.

               Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his 
               eyes.

                                     BEN
                         This time, let go your conscious 
                         self and act on instinct.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         With the blast shield down, I can't 
                         even see. How am I supposed to fight?

                                     BEN
                         Your eyes can deceive you. Don't 
                         trust them.

               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker 
               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then 
               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly 
               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits 
               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful 
               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

                                     BEN
                         Stretch out with your feelings.

               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes 
               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the 
               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original 
               position.

                                     BEN
                         You see, you can do it.

                         In my experience, there's no such 
                         thing as luck.

                         Look, going good against remotes is 
                         one thing. Going good against the 
                         living? That's something else.

                         Our scout ships have reached 
                         Dantooine. They found the remains of 
                         a Rebel base, but they estimate that 
                         it has been deserted for some time. 
                         They are now conducting an extensive 
                         search of the surrounding systems.

                         I told you she would never consciously 
                         betray the Rebellion.

               EXT. HYPERSPACE

               The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange 
               surreal light show surrounds the ship.

                         Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in 
                         the sublight engines.

               Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window 
               stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then 
               stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently 
               shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering 
               the sides of the ship.

                                     HAN
                         What the...? Aw, we've come out of 
                         hyperspace into a meteor shower. 
                         Some kind of asteroid collision. 
                         It's not on any of the charts.

               The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool 
               in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing 
               cockpit.

                         blown away.

                         What? How?

               Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to 
               settle down.

                         The entire starfleet couldn't destroy 
                         the whole planet. It'd take a thousand 
                         ships with more fire power than 
                         I've...

               A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled 
               alarm starts humming.

                                     HAN
                         There's another ship coming in.

                         Maybe they know what happened.

                         It's an Imperial fighter.

               Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside 
               the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned 
               Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         It followed us!

                         It'd be as well to let it go. It's 
                         too far out of range.

               The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the

               The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny 
               fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter 
               until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben

               The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as 
               they race toward camera and disappear over head.

               The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away 
               toward the gargantuan battle station.

                         this ship checked!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

               A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In 
               a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant 
               officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly 
               pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his 
               head out of a third locker.

                                     LUKE
                         Boy, it's lucky you had these 
                         compartments.

                                     HAN
                         I use them for smuggling. I never 
                         thought I'd be smuggling myself in 
                         them. This is ridiculous. Even if I 
                         could take off, I'd never get past 
                         the tractor beam.

                                     BEN
                         Leave that to me!

                                     HAN
                         Damn fool. I knew that you were going 
                         to say that!

                                     BEN
                         Who's the more foolish... the fool 
                         or the fool who follows him?

               Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the 
               two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

                                     TROOPER
                         The ship's all yours. If the scanners 
                         pick up anything, report it 
                         immediately. All right, let's go.

               The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound 
               is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

                                     HAN'S VOICE
                         Hey down there, could you give us a 
                         hand with this?

               The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire 
               is heard.

               INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE

               In a very small command office near the entrance to the 
               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices 
               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at 
                         your post? TX-four-one-two, do you 
                         copy?

               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and 
               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
               annoyed look.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         Take over. We've got a bad 
                         transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing 
               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary 
               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted 
               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the 
               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed 
               as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, between his howling and 
                         your blasting everything in sight, 
                         it's a wonder the whole station 
                         doesn't know we're here.

                                     HAN
                         Bring them on! I prefer a straight 
                         fight to all this sneaking around.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We found the computer outlet, sir.

               Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of 
               the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it 
               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  
               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

                                     BEN
                         Plug in. He should be able to 
                         interpret the entire Imperial computer 
                         network.

               Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
               vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
               to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's found the main computer 
                         to power the tractor beam that's 
                         holding the ship here. He'll try to 
                         make the precise location appear on 
                         the monitor.

               The computer monitor flashes readouts.

                                     THREEPIO
                         The tractor beam is coupled to the 
                         main reactor in seven locations. A 
                         power loss at one of the terminals 
                         will allow the ship to leave.

               Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

                                     BEN
                         I don't think you boys can help. I 
                         must go alone.

                                     HAN
                         Whatever you say. I've done more 
                         that I bargained for on this trip 
                         already.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to go with you.

                                     BEN
                         Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch 
                         over the droids.

                                     LUKE
                         But he can...

                                     BEN
                         They must be delivered safely or 
                         other star systems will suffer the 
                         same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny 
                         lies along a different path than 
                         mine. The Force will be with you... 
                         always!

               Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
               out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
               hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head 
               in agreement.

                                     HAN
                         Boy you said it, Chewie.

               Han looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         Where did you dig up that old fossil?

                                     LUKE
                         Ben is a great man.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, great at getting us into 
                         trouble.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't hear you give any ideas...

                                     HAN
                         Well, anything would be better than 
                         just hanging around waiting for him 
                         to pick us up...

                                     LUKE
                         Who do you think...

               Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  
               Luke goes over to him.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. 
                         He says "I found her", and keeps 
                         repeating, "She's here."

                                     LUKE
                         Well, who... who has he found?

               Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Princess Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         The princess? She's here?

                                     HAN
                         Princess? What's going on?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
                         three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to 
                         be terminated.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no! We've got to do something.

                                     HAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         The droid belongs to her. She's the 
                         one in the message... We've got to 
                         help her.

                                     HAN
                         Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. 
                         The old man wants us to wait right 
                         here.

                                     LUKE
                         But he didn't know she was here. 
                         Look, will you just find a way back 
                         into the detention block?

                                     HAN
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     LUKE
                         They're going to execute her. Look, 
                         a few minutes ago you said you didn't 
                         want to just wait here to be captured. 
                         Now all you want to do is stay.

                                     HAN
                         Marching into the detention area is 
                         not what I had in mind.

                                     LUKE
                         But they're going to kill her!

                                     HAN
                         Better her than me...

                                     LUKE
                         She's rich.

               Chewbacca growls.

                                     HAN
                         Rich?

                                     LUKE
                         Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you 
                         were to rescue her, the reward would 
                         be...

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Well more wealth that you can imagine.

                                     HAN
                         I don't know, I can imagine quite a 
                         bit!

                                     LUKE
                         You'll get it!

                                     HAN
                         I better!

                                     LUKE
                         You will...

                                     HAN
                         All right, kid. But you'd better be 
                         right about this.

               Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                                     LUKE
                         All right.

                                     HAN
                         What's your plan?

                                     LUKE
                         Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders 
                         there will you?

               Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on 
                         you.

               Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Han, you put these on.

               Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

                                     HAN
                         Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know 
                         what he has in mind.

               The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as 
               Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for 
                         asking... but, ah... what should 
                         Artoo and I do if we're discovered 
                         here?

                                     LUKE
                         Lock the door!

                                     HAN
                         And hope they don't have blasters.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That isn't very reassuring.

               Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and 
               start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits 
               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
               glance.

               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.

               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY 
               AREA

               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

                                     HAN
                         This is not going to work.

                                     LUKE
                         Why didn't you say so before?

                                     HAN
                         I did say so before!

               INT. DETENTION AREA

               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
               the trio.

                                     OFFICER
                         Where are you taking this... thing?

               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
               up.

                                     LUKE
                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                         three-eight.

                                     OFFICER
                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
                         it.

               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
               the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

                                     HAN
                         Look out! He's loose!

                                     LUKE
                         He's going to pull us all apart.

                                     HAN
                         Go get him!

               The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
               system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

                                     HAN
                         We've got to find out which cell 
                         this princess of yours is in. Here 
                         it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. 
                         You go get her. I'll hold them here.

               Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
               the buzzing comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (sounding official)
                         Everything is under control. Situation 
                         normal.

                              (getting nervous)
                         Uh... had a slight weapons

                         perfectly all right now. We're fine. 
                         We're all fine here, now, thank you.

                         Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor 
                         leak here now. Give us a few minutes 
                         to lock it down. Large leak... very 
                         dangerous.

                         Who is this? What's your operating 
                         number?

               Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

                                     HAN
                         Boring conversation anyway.
                              (yelling down the 
                              hall)
                         Luke! We're going to have company!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW

               Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
               away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
               the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
               and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
               her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
               staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

                                     LEIA
                              (finally)
                         Aren't you a little short to be a 
                         stormtrooper?

               Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                                     LUKE
                         What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke 
                         Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

                                     LEIA
                         You're who?

                                     LUKE
                         I'm here to rescue you. I've got 
                         your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben 
                         Kenobi.

                                     LEIA
                         Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

                                     LUKE
                         Come on!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the 
               far end of the conference table.

                                     VADER
                         He is here...

                                     TARKIN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think 
                         so?

                                     VADER
                         A tremor in the Force. The last time 
                         I felt it was in the presence of my 
                         old master.

                                     TARKIN
                         Surely he must be dead by now.

                                     VADER
                         Don't underestimate the power of the 
                         Force.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Jedi are extinct, their fire has 
                         gone out of the universe. You, my 
                         friend, are all that's left of their 
                         religion.

               There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

                                     TARKIN
                         If you're right, he must not be 
                         allowed to escape.

                                     VADER
                         Escape is not his plan. I must face 
                         him alone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY

               An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the 
               elevator door.

                                     HAN
                         Chewie!

               Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

                                     HAN
                         Get behind me! Get behind me!

               A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door 
               through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

               Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke 
               and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting 
               up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                                     HAN
                         Can't get out that way.

                                     LEIA
                         Looks like you managed to cut off 
                         our only escape route.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Maybe you'd like it back in your 
                         cell, Your Highness.

               Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they 
               continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their 
               way down the corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

                              (over comlink)
                         Yes sir?

                                     LUKE
                         We've been cut off! Are there any 
                         other ways out of the cell bay?... 
                         What was that? I didn't copy!

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER

               Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and 
               whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink 
               transmitter.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I said, all systems have been alerted 
                         to your presence, sir. The main 
                         entrance seems to be the only way in 
                         or out; all other information on 
                         your level is restricted.

               Someone begins banging on the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as 
               they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca 
               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far 
               and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke 
               fills the narrow cell corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         There isn't any other way out.

                                     HAN
                         I can't hold them off forever! Now 
                         what?

                                     LEIA
                         This is some rescue. When you came 
                         in here, didn't you have a plan for 
                         getting out?

                                     HAN
                              (pointing to Luke)
                         He's the brains, sweetheart.

               Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I didn't...

               The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
               the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

                                     HAN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     LEIA
                         Somebody has to save our skins. Into 
                         the garbage chute, wise guy.

               She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
               look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
               says something.

                                     HAN
                         Get in there you big furry oaf! I 
                         don't care what you smell! Get in 
                         there and don't worry about it.

               Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
               tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
               way toward the opening.

                                     HAN
                         Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to 
                         kill her or I'm beginning to like 
                         her. Get in there!

               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
               slides into the chute himself and is gone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
               budge.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
                         wonderful idea. What an incredible 
                         smell you've discovered! Let's get 
                         out of here! Get away from there...

                                     LUKE
                         No! wait!

               Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
               rather grim look on her face.

                                     LUKE
                         Will you forget it? I already tried 
                         it. It's magnetically sealed!

                                     LEIA
                         Put that thing away! You're going to 
                         get us all killed.

                                     HAN
                         Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I 
                         had everything under control until 
                         you led us down here. You know, it's 
                         not going to take them long to figure 
                         out what happened to us.

                                     LEIA
                         It could be worse...

               A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
               murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
               drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

                                     HAN
                         It's worse.

                                     LUKE
                         There's something alive in here!

                                     HAN
                         That's your imagination.

                                     LUKE
                         Something just moves past my leg! 
                         Look! Did you see that?

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Help!

               Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air 
               and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
               his throat.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke!

               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

                                     LUKE
                         Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

                                     HAN
                         Where?

                                     LUKE
                         Anywhere! Oh!!

               Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
               muck by the slimy tentacle.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke!

               Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and 
               move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
               howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
               suddenly bobs to the surface.

                                     LEIA
                         Grab him!

               Luke seems to be released by the thing.

                                     LEIA
                         What happened?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know, it just let go of me 
                         and disappeared...

                                     HAN
                         I've got a very bad feeling about 
                         this.

               Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
               edge toward the Rebels.

                                     LUKE
                         The walls are moving!

                                     LEIA
                         Don't just stand there. Try to brace 
                         it with something.

               They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
               walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
               trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

                                     LUKE
                         Wait a minute!

               Luke pulls out his comlink.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! 
                         Where could he be?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

               A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for 
               See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which 
               is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
               floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Take over!
                              (pointing to the dead 
                              officer)
                         See to him! Look there!

               A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides 
               open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
               his bronze companion out into the office.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're madmen! They're heading for 
                         the prison level. If you hurry, you 
                         might catch them.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (to his troops)
                         Follow me! You stand guard.

               The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to 
               watch over the command office.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Come on!

               The guard aims a blaster at them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
                         the circuits of my counterpart here. 
                         If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
                         him down to maintenance.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right.

               The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
               out the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
               Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
               giant paws.

               Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
               snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

               Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
               Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                                     HAN
                         Get to the top!

                                     LEIA
                         I can't

                                     LUKE
                         Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, 
                         will you come in?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     THREEPIO
                         They aren't here! Something must 
                         have happened to them. See if they've 
                         been captured.

               Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
               socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
               the tiny robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hurry!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
               the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
               other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
               it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
               the first crushing pressure against her body.

                                     HAN
                         One thing's for sure. We're all going 
                         to be a lot thinner!
                              (to Leia)
                         Get on top of it!

                         I'm trying!

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Thank goodness, they haven't found 
                         them! Where could they be?

               Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I 
                         turned it off!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
               head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
               and he rips it off his belt.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

               Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, 
               but not distinctly.

                                     THREEPIO

               Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible 
               screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! 
                         Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast 
                         enough. It's all my fault! My poor 
                         master!

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Threepio, we're all right!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. 
               The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace 
               in the background.

                                     LUKE
                         We're all right. You did great.

               Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a 
               number.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey... hey, open the pressure 
                         maintenance hatch on unit number... 
                         where are we?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     HAN
                              (over comlink)
                         Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

               Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
               tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
               to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
               carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
               and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

               The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
               Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
               belts.

                                     HAN
                         If we can just avoid any more female 
                         advice, we ought to be able to get 
                         out of here.

               Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
               from Solo.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, let's get moving!

               Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
               room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Where are you going?

               The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
               tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
               victim. Han aims his pistol.

                                     LEIA
                         No, wait. They'll hear!

               Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
               relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
               shakes his head in disgust.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Come here, you big coward!

               Chewie shakes his head "no."

                                     HAN
                         Chewie! Come here!

                                     LEIA
                         Listen. I don't know who you are, or 
                         where you came from, but from now 
                         on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

               Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

                                     HAN
                         Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
                         one thing straight! I take orders 
                         from one person! Me!

                                     LEIA
                         It's a wonder you're still alive.
                              (looking at Chewie)
                         Will somebody get this big walking 
                         carpet out of my way?

               Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         No reward is worth this.

               They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

               Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
               stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
               feet of him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Secure this area until the alert is 
                         canceled.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Give me regular reports.

               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Do you know what's going on?

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Maybe it's another drill.

               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
               past the troopers and into the main hallway.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         What was that?

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
                         it.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
               stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (looking at his ship)
                         There she is.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio, do you copy?

                                     THREEPIO
                              (voice)
                         For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
                         main hangar across from the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         We're right above you. Stand by.

               Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
               the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
               points out the window to the ship.

                                     LEIA
                         You came in that thing? You're braver 
                         that I thought.

                                     HAN
                         Nice! Come on!

               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         It's them! Blast them!

               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke and Leia)
                         Get back to the ship!

                                     LUKE
                         Where are you going? Come back!

               Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

                                     LEIA
                         He certainly has courage.

                                     LUKE
                         What good will it do us if he gets 
                         himself killed? Come on!

               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
               moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
               the other way also.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
               open hatchway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
               his arm and pulls him back.

                                     LUKE
                              (gasping)
                         I think we took a wrong turn.

               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

                                     LEIA
                         There's no lock!

               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

                                     LUKE
                         That oughta hold it for a while.

                                     LEIA
                         Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
                         the control that extends the bridge.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, I think I just blasted it.

               Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
               stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
               ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

                                     LEIA
                         They're coming through!

               Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
               laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
               and grabs at his chest.

               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         Here, hold this.

               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
               of more troops.

                                     LEIA
                         Here they come!

               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

                                     LEIA
                         For luck!

               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
               the tiny subhallway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the 
               pirateship entry ramp.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where could they be?

               Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
               and right, beeping a response.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several

               At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
               front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
               before the doors slam shut.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
               and steps slowly forward.

                                     VADER
                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
                         We meet again, at last. The circle 
                         is now complete.

               Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
               position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

                                     VADER
                         When I left you, I was but the 
                         learner; now I am the master.

                                     BEN
                         Only a master of evil, Darth.

               The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
               moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
               moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
               sound.

                                     VADER
                         Your powers are weak, old man.

                                     BEN
                         You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
                         me down, I shall become more powerful 
                         than you can possibly imagine.

               Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
               against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
               Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

                                     HAN
                         Didn't we just leave this party?

               Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

                                     HAN
                         What kept you?

                                     LEIA
                         We ran into some old friends.

                                     LUKE
                         Is the ship all right?

                                     HAN
                         Seems okay, if we can get to it. 
                         Just hope the old man got the tractor 
                         beam out of commission.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
               hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
               Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
               of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
               group's vantage point.

                                     LUKE
                         Look!

               Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
               emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
               bay.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
               Imperial docking bay.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come on, Artoo, we're going!

               Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
               were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
               Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
               troops rush toward the battling knights.

                                     HAN
                         Now's our chance! Go!

               They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
               charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
               look on his face.

               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
               and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
               The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
               Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
               their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
               advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on!

                                     LEIA
                         Come on! Luke, its too late!

                                     HAN
                         Blast the door! Kid!

               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
               fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Run, Luke! Run!

               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
               troopers and races into the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. 
               The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the 
               ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

                                     HAN
                         I hope the old man got that tractor 
                         beam out if commission, or this is 
                         going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
                         hit it!

               Chewbacca growls in agreement.

               The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking 
               bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness 
               of space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
               blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
               him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
               sits down beside him.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

                         shields while I charge up the main

               Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, 
               as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't believe he's gone.

               Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

                                     LEIA
                         There wasn't anything you could have 
                         done.

               Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the 
               princess.

                                     HAN

               Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking

               An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, 
               causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

               Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing 
               laserbeams from his cannon.

               EXT. TIE FIGHTER

               A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a 
               fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He 
               connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs 
               victoriously.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, 
               unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, 
               smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular 
               direct hit.

                                     LUKE
                         Got him! I got him!

               Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully 
               returns.

                                     HAN
                         Great kid! Don't get cocky.

               Han turns back to his laser cannon.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking 
               over her shoulder out the ports.

                                     LEIA
                         There are still two more of them out 
                         there!

               EXT. SPACE

               A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts 
               at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke and Han look into their respective projected target 
               screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han 
               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser 
               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts 
               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his 
               face.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing 
               destructive blasts at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, 
               and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected 
               screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces 
               slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

               EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER

               The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, 
               firing upon the Falcon.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc 
               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the 
               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
               of burning fragments.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         That's it! We did it!

               The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

                                     LEIA
                         We did it!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY

               Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled 
               in the smoking, sparking wires.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Help! I think I'm melting!
                              (to Artoo)
                         This is all your fault.

               Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.

               EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

               The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically 
               through space.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is 
               watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

                                     TARKIN
                         Are they away?

                                     VADER
                         They have just made the jump into 
                         hyperspace.

                                     TARKIN
                         You're sure the homing beacon is 
                         secure aboard their ship? I'm taking 
                         an awful risk, Vader. This had better 
                         work.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of 
               the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the 
               damage. Leia is seated near Han.

                                     HAN
                         Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You 
                         know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

                                     LEIA
                         That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, 
                         they let us go. It's the only 
                         explanation for the ease of our 
                         escape.

                                     HAN
                         Easy... you call that easy?

                                     LEIA
                         Their tracking us!

                                     HAN
                         Not this ship, sister.

               Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                                     LEIA
                         At least the information in Artoo is 
                         still intact.

                                     HAN
                         What's so important? What's he 
                         carrying?

                                     LEIA
                         The technical readouts of that battle 
                         station. I only hope that when the 
                         data is analyzed, a weakness can be 
                         found. It's not over yet!

                                     HAN
                         It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't 
                         in this for your revolution, and I'm 
                         not in it for you, Princess. I expect 
                         to be well paid. I'm in it for the 
                         money!

                                     LEIA
                         You needn't worry about your reward. 
                         If money is all that you love, then 
                         that's what you'll receive!

               She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
               passes Luke coming in.

                                     LEIA
                         Your friend is quite a mercenary. I 
                         wonder if he really cares about 
                         anything... or anyone.

                                     LUKE
                         I care!

               Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
               stare out at the vast blackness of space.

                                     LUKE
                         So... what do you think of her, Han?

                                     HAN
                         I'm trying not to, kid!

                                     LUKE
                              (under his breath)
                         Good...

                                     HAN
                         Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I 
                         don't know, what do you think? Do 
                         you think a princess and a guy like 
                         me...

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
               young Luke's jealousy.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
               Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

               EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

               An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
               He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
               visible in the foliage.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

               Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
               lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
               fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
               others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

               Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
               military speeder.

               INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
               up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
               commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
               gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                                     WILLARD
                              (holding Leia)
                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.

               Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

                                     WILLARD
                         When we heard about Alderaan, we 
                         were afraid that you were... lost 
                         along with your father.

                                     LEIA
                         We don't have time for our sorrows, 
                         Commander. The battle station has 
                         surely tracked us here.
                              (looking pointedly to 
                              Han)
                         It's the only explanation for the 
                         ease of our escape. You must use the 
                         information in this R2 unit to plan 
                         the attack. It is our only hope.

               EXT. SPACE

               The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red 
               planet Yavin.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their 
               discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer 
               the call.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a 
               moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

               EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

               A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, 
               surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of 
               twisted green.

               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
               and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
               readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
               Chewbacca are standing near the back.

                                     DODONNA
                         The battle station is heavily shielded 
                         and carries a firepower greater than 
                         half the star fleet. It's defenses 
                         are designed around a direct large-
                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
                         should be able to penetrate the outer 
                         defense.

               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
               and addresses Dodonna.

                                     GOLD LEADER
                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
                         good are snub fighters going to be 
                         against that?

                                     DODONNA
                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
                         small one-man fighter to be any 
                         threat, or they'd have a tighter 
                         defense. An analysis of the plans 
                         provided by Princess Leia has 
                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
                         station.

               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

                                     DODONNA
                         The approach will not be easy. You 
                         are required to maneuver straight 
                         down this trench and skim the surface 
                         to this point. The target area is 
                         only two meters wide. It's a small 
                         thermal exhaust port, right below 
                         the main port. The shaft leads 
                         directly to the reactor system. A 
                         precise hit will start a chain 
                         reaction which should destroy the 
                         station.

               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

                                     DODONNA
                         Only a precise hit will set up a 
                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
                         torpedoes.

               Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about

                         That's impossible, even for a 
                         computer.

                         It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
                         eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back 
                         home. They're not much bigger than 
                         two meters.

                         Man your ships! And may the Force be 
                         with you!

               The group rises and begins to leave.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the 
               tiny green moon.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with 
               interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another 
               on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and 
               the forth moon.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the

                         This will be a day long remembered. 
                         It has seen the end of Kenobi and it 
                         will soon see the end of the 
                         Rebellion.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
               hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
               Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
               unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
               activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
               onto an armored speeder.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         All flight trooper, man your stations. 
                         All flight troops, man your stations.

               Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
               pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
               his friend's departure.

                                     LUKE
                         So... you got your reward and you're 
                         just leaving then?

                                     HAN
                         That's right, yeah! I got some old 
                         debts I've got to pay off with this 
                         stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't 
                         think I'd be fool enough to stick 
                         around here, do you? Why don't you 
                         come with us? You're pretty good in 
                         a fight. I could use you.

                                     LUKE
                              (getting angry)
                         Come on! Why don't you take a look 
                         around? You know what's about to 
                         happen, what they're up against. 
                         They could use a good pilot like 
                         you. You're turning your back on 
                         them.

                                     HAN
                         What good's a reward if you ain't 
                         around to use it? Besides, attacking 
                         that battle station ain't my idea of 
                         courage. It's more like suicide.

                                     LUKE
                         All right. Well, take care of 
                         yourself, Han. I guess that's what 
                         you're best at, isn't it?

               Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

                                     HAN
                         Hey, Luke... may the Force be with 
                         you!

               Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
               a small wave and then goes off.

               Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

                                     HAN
                         What're you lookin' at? I know what 
                         I'm doing.

               INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

               Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                                     LEIA
                         What's wrong?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really 
                         thought he'd change his mind.

                                     LEIA
                         He's got to follow his own path. No 
                         one can choose it for him.

                                     LUKE
                         I only wish Ben were here.

               Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
               heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
               his arm.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you 
                         get here... are you going out with 
                         us?!

                                     LUKE
                         Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there 
                         with you! Listen, have I got some 
                         stories to tell...

               Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
               behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
               leader.

                                     RED LEADER
                         Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
                         been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
                         five?

                                     BIGGS
                         Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in 
                         the outer rim territories.

               Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
               his fighter.

                                     RED LEADER
                         I met your father once when I was 
                         just a boy, he was a great pilot. 
                         You'll do all right. If you've got 
                         half of your father's skill, you'll 
                         do better than all right.

                                     LUKE
                         Thank you, sir. I'll try.

               Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                                     BIGGS
                         I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
                         tell me your stories when we come 
                         back. All right?

                                     LUKE
                         I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

                                     BIGGS
                              (going off)
                         You did, all right. It's going to be 
                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
                         of shooting stars that'll never be 
                         stopped!

               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
               his ship.

               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
               back of the fighter.

                                     CHIEF
                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
                         beat up. Do you want a new one?

                                     LUKE
                         Not on your life! That little droid 
                         and I have been through a lot 
                         together.
                              (to Artoo)
                         You okay, Artoo?

               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
               that he is fine.

               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
               beeps good-bye.

                                     CHIEF
                         Okay, easy she goes!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
                         come back.

               Artoo beeps in agreement.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You wouldn't want my life to get 
                         boring, would you?

               Artoo whistles his reply.

               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Luke, the Force will be with you.

               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage 
               in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud 
               cover.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly 
               before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its 
               four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves 
               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills 
               the war room.

               The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface 
               of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying 
               in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

               EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

               Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow 
               around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in 
               formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly 
               pull away.

               INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT

               Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,

               Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the 
               approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted 
               slightly.

               EXT. SPACE

               The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
               size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
               metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
               is built into the surface on one side.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome 
               spectacle.

                                     WEDGE

               EXT. SPACE

               As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
               size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
               of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
               sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
               and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
               city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

                         now.

               INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

               Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
               in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
               the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
               position.

                                     RED LEADER
                         We're in position. I'm going to cut 
                         across the axis and try and draw 
                         their fire.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive 
               towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across 
               the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- 
               powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate 
               the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting 
               devices.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
               wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death 
               Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and 
               fires.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute 
               armaments and unlocking power cables.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.

               X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous 
               fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit 
               window.

                                     LUKE
                         This is Red Five; I'm going in!

               EXT. SPACE

               Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak 
               from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on 
               the dim surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able 
               to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

               EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR

               Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges 
               of his wings slightly scorched.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. 
               Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface 
               with laserbolts.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in 
               all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.  
               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and 
               foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes 
               up to him.

                         evading our turbo-lasers!

                         We'll have to destroy them ship to 
                         ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
               noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
               with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose 
               down and starts his attack dive.

                         fire coming from the right side of 
                         that deflection tower.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon 
               and down onto the dim grey surface.

               EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING

               A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the 
               onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements 
               erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on 
               the surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window 
               as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of 
               his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers 
               his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from 
               the surface towards the heavens.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout 
               the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke 
               and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of 
               explosions.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and 
               gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A 
               dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small 
               auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces 
               nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides 
               technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna 
               watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working 
               over a screen speaks into his headset.

               INT. RED LEADER'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches 
               the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

                         Keep up your visual scanning. With 
                         all this jamming, they'll be on top 
                         of you before your scope can pick 
                         them up.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon, 
               four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.  
               Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan 
               with the remaining two TIE ships.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The 
               horizon in the background twists around as he peels off, 
               hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

               Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed 
               by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several 
               laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying 
               to avoid him.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward 
               the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE 
               fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

               INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to 
               normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

               Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now 
               followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of 
               sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the 
               Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the 
               background.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding

                         Hang on back there.

               Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his 
               head turns.

               Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star, 
               an Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               The fighter pilot watches Wedge's X-wing approach. Another X-
               wing joins him, and both unleash a volley of laserfire on 
               the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter explodes, filling the screen with white light.  
               Luke's ship can be seen far in the distance.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

               Luke looks about in relief.

               Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the 
               surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep 
               trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as 
               laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

               INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered 
               helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He 
               looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is 
               buffeted by Imperial flak.

               INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

               Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the 
               exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing 
               numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to 
               bounce about.

               An exterior surface gun blazes away at the oncoming Rebel 
               fighters.

                         the surface, some on the towers.

               Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target 
               screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target 
               near the center blinks on and off.

               The three Y-wing fighters race toward camera and zoom overhead 
               through a hail of laserfire.

               Gold Leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front 
               of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.

               Gold Two, a younger pilot about Luke's age, pulls down his 
               targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under 
               intense laser barrage.

                         Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

               As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly 
               all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench 
               as the surface whips past in a blur.

                                     GOLD TWO

               Luke's X-wing streaks through the trench, firing lasers.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke breaks into a nervous sweat as the laserfire is returned, 
               knicking one of his wings close to the engine.

                                     LUKE

                         lock it down!

               EXT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER

               Artoo works to repair the damages. The canyon wall rushes by 
               in the background, making his delicate task seem even more 
               precarious.

               Ignoring the bumpy ride, flak, and lasers, a beeping Artoo-

               Luke looks into his targeting device. He moves it away for a 
               moment and ponders its use. He looks back into the computer 
               targeter.

                                     HAN
                              (over speaker)
                         Now let's blow this thing and go 
                         home!

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust 
               port, then fires his laser torpedoes.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply 
               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do 
               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are 
               heading for the main reactor.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke throws his head back in relief.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls 
               the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Stand by to fire at Rebel base.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin 
               in the distance.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff 
               Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Standing by.

               The rumble of a distant explosion begins.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like 
               Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small 
               flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                                     HAN
                         Great shot, kid. That was one in a 
                         million.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Remember, the Force will be with 
                         you... always.

               The ship rocks back and forth.

               EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER

               Vader's ship spins off into space.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR

               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a 
               throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder 
               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
               Princess Leia rushes toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
               one another, slapping each other on the back.

                                     HAN
                              (laughing)
                         Hey! Hey!

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
                         it!

                                     HAN
                         Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
                         the credit and take all the reward.

               Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
               at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

                                     LEIA
                              (laughing)
                         Hey, I knew there was more to you 
                         than money.

               Luke looks toward the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
               fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
                         something!
                              (to mechanic)
                         You can repair him, can't you?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         We'll get to work on him right away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
                         my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
                         gladly donate them.

                                     LUKE
                         He'll be all right.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
               beeps with happiness.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               END CREDITS OVER STARS

                                         THE END
EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

				There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
				Several hundred solar systems under
				the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
				Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
				secede from the Republic.

				This separatist movement has made it
				difficult for the limited number of
				Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
				order in the galaxy.

				Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
				Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
				to vote on the critical issue
				of creating an army to assist the
				overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ 
			Cordé...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

				CORDÉ
			... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.

				AMIDALA
			No!... No!... No!...

PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

				AMIDALA
			I should not have come back.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			This vote is very important. You did
			your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
			come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
			please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! We shall have order! The motion
			for the Republic to commission an army
			takes precedent, and that is what we
			will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

				PALPATINE
			...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
			me... I have just received some
			tragic and disturbing news. Senator
			Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
			been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

				PALPATINE
				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she was Queen. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			How many more Senators will die
			before this civil strife ends! We
			must confront these rebels now,
			and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
			this assassination? We are no
			longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

				ORN FREE TAA
			The Republic needs more security
			now! Before it comes to war.

				PALPATINE
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malastare that negotiations are
			continuing with the separatists.
			Peace is our objective here... not
			war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

				AMIDALA
			My noble colleagues, I concur with
			the Supreme Chancellor. At all
			costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great surprise and
			joy the chair recognises the
			Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.

				PADMÉ
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

				PADMÉ
			Wake up, Senators... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

				ORN FREE TAA
			My motion to defer the vote must
			be dealt with first. That is the
			rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

				PALPATINE
			Due to the lateness of the hour
			and the seriousness of this
			motion, we will take up these
			matters tomorrow. Until then, the
			Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

				PALPATINE
			I don't know how much longer I can
			hold off the vote, my friends.
			More and more star systems are
			joining the separatists.

				MACE WINDU
			If they do break away -

				PALPATINE
			No! I will not let that happen!

				MACE WINDU
			But if they do, you must realise
			there aren't enough Jedi to
			protect the Republic. We are
			keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

				PALPATINE
			Master Yoda, do you think it will
			really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

				YODA
			Worse than war, I fear... Much
			worse. 

				PALPATINE
			What?

				MACE WINDU
			What do you sense, Master?

				YODA
			Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
			clouds everything. But this I am
			sure of -
				(opens his eyes)
			Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

				DAR WAC
			The loyalist committee has arrived,
			my Lord. 

				PALPATINE
			Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

				YODA
			With you the force is strong...
			young Senator. To see you alive
			brings warm feeling to my heart.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
			have any idea who was behind
			the attack?

				MACE WINDU
			Our intelligence points to
			disgruntled spice miners, on
			the moons of Naboo.

				PADMÉ
			I don't wish to disagree but I
			think that Count Dooku was behind
			it.

There is a stir of surprise.

				MACE WINDU
			You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
			was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
			assassinate anyone, it is not in
			his character.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			He is a political idealist, not
			a murderer.

				YODA
			In dark times nothing is what it
			appears to be, but the fact remains
			Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku has always avoided
			any kind of conflict. It appears
			he has no desire to start a war.
			Why would he kill you? To what end?

				PADMÉ 
			I don't know, but everything in my
			being tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

				PALPATINE
			Master Jedi, may I suggest that
			the Senator be placed under the
			protection of your graces.

				BAIL ORGANA
			Do you think that is a wise use
			of manpower during these stressful
			times?

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, if I may comment, I
			do not believe the...

				PALPATINE
			..."situation is that serious."
			No, but I do, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, please! I don't want
			any more guards!

				PALPATINE
			I realise all too well that
			additional security might be
			disruptive for you, but perhaps
			someone you are familiar with... an
			old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

				MACE WINDU
			That's possible. He has just
			returned from a Border dispute on
			Ansion.

				PALPATINE
			You must remember him, M'Lady...
			he watched over you during the
			blockade conflict.

				PADMÉ
			This is not necessary, Chancellor.

				PALPATINE
			Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
			will rest easier. We had a big
			scare today. The thought of
			losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

				MACE WINDU
			I will have Obi-Wan report to you
			immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

				YODA
			Too little about yourself you
			worry, Senator, and too much about
			politics. Be mindful of your
			danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

				PALPATINE
			I will not like this Republiv, that
			has stood for over a thousand
			years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

				JAR JAR
			Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
			to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

				OBI-WAN
			It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

				JAR JAR
			Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
			Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
			completely forgot myself for
			a moment there. I have had to learn
			Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
			native now. Don't really see the
			point, actually, but members of
			the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			...and this, I take it, is your
			apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
			Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
				(Looks at Anakin)
			Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
			Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
			believen.

				ANAKIN
			Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

				JAR JAR
			Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

				JAR JAR
			Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
			dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
			myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a great pleasure to see you again,
			M'Lady.

				PADMÉ
			It has been far too long Master
			Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
			have crossed again... but I must
			warn you that I think your
			presence here is unnecessary.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sure the Jedi Council have
			their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

				PADMÉ
			Annie??
				(stares)
			My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

				ANAKIN
				(trying to be smooth)
			So have you... grown more
			beautiful, I mean... and much
			shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			Oh Annie, you'll always be that
			little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

				OBI-WAN
			Our presence will be invisible,
			M'Lady.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I am very grateful you are here,
			Master Kenobi. The situation is
			more dangerous than the Senator
			will admit.

				PADMÉ
			I don't need more security, I need
			answers. I want to know who is
			trying to kill me.

				OBI-WAN
				(frowning)
			We're here to protect you
			Senator, not to start an
			investigation.

				ANAKIN
			We will find out who is trying to
			kill you Padmé, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going to exceed our
			mandate, my young Padawan learner.

				ANAKIN
			I meant in the interest of
			protecting her, Master, of course.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going through this
			exercise again, Anakin. You will
			pay attention to my lead.

				ANAKIN
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			What??!!

				ANAKIN
			Why else do you think we were
			assigned to her, if not to find
			the killer? Protection is a job
			for local security... not Jedi.
			It's overkill, Master.
			Investigation is implied in our
			mandate.

				OBI-WAN
			We will do as the Council has
			instructed, and you will learn
			your place, young one.

				PADMÉ
			Perhaps with merely your presence,
			the mysteries surrounding this
			threat will be revealed.  Now if
			you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Well, I know I feel a lot better
			having you here.
			I'll have an officer on every
			floor and I'll be at the command
			centre downstairs.

				JAR JAR 
			Mesa busten wit happiness seein
			Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
			times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

				ANAKIN
			She didn't even recognise me, Jar
			Jar. I thought about her every
			day since we parted... and she's
			forgotten me completely.

				JAR JAR
			Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
			see-en her in longo time.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you're focusing on the
			Negative again. Be mindful of your
			thoughts. She was glad to see us.
			Now lets check the security here.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

				MACE WINDU
			Why couldn't we see this attack on
			the Senator?

				YODA
			Masking the future, is this
			disturbance in the Force.

				MACE WINDU
			The propecy is coming true, the
			Dark Side is growing.

				YODA
			And only those who have turned to
			the Dark Side can sense the
			possibilities of the future. Only
			going through the Dark Side can we
			see.

				MACE WINDU
			It's been ten years, and the Sith
			still have no shown themselves.
			Do you think they are behind this?

				YODA
			...Out there, they are. A
			certainty that is.

				MACE WINDU
			Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
			will be able to bring balance to
			the Force?

				YODA
			Only if he chooses to follow his
			destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

				OBI-WAN
			Captain Typho has more than enough
			men downstairs. No assassin will
			try that way. Any activity up
			here?

				ANAKIN
			Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
			just waiting here for something to
			happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

				OBI-WAN
			What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

				ANAKIN
			She covered that camera. I don't
			think she liked me watching her.

				OBI-WAN
			What is she thinking?

				ANAKIN
			She programmed Artoo to warn us if
			there's an intruder.

				OBI-WAN
			It's not an intruder I'm worried
			about. There are many other ways
			to kill a Senator.

				ANAKIN
			I know, but we also want to catch
			this assassin. Don't we, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			You're using her as bait??

				ANAKIN
			It was her idea... No harm will
			come to her. I can sense
			everything going on in that room.
			Trust me.

				OBI-WAN
			It's too risky... and your senses
			aren't that attuned, young
			apprentice.

				ANAKIN
			And yours are?

				OBI-WAN
			Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

				OBI-WAN 
			You look tired.

				ANAKIN
			I don't sleep well, anymore.

				OBI-WAN 
			Because of your mother?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know why I keep dreaming
			About her now. I haven't seen her
			since I was little.

				OBI-WAN
			Dreams pass in time.

				ANAKIN
			I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
			Being around her again is...
			intoxicating.

				OBI-WAN
			Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
			betray you. You've made a
			commitment to the Jedi order... a
			commitment not easily broken...
			and don't forget she's a
			politician. They're not to be
			trusted.

				ANAKIN 
			She's not like the others in the
			Senate, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			It's been my experience that
			Senators are only focused on
			pleasing those who fund their
			campaigns... and they are more
			than willing to forget the
			niceties of democracy to get those
			funds.

				ANAKIN
			Not another lecture, Master. Not
			on the economics of politics....
			It's too early in the morning... and
			besides, you're generalising. The
			Chancellor doesn't appear to
			be corrupt.

				OBI-WAN
			Palpatine's a politician, I've
			observed that he is very clever at
			following the passions and
			prejudices of the Senators.

				ANAKIN
			I think he is a good man. My
			instincts are very positive
			about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

				OBI-WAN
			I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

				ANAKIN
			Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			That was wacky! I almost lost you
			in the traffic.

				OBI-WAN
			What took you so long?

				ANAKIN
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
			find a speeder I really liked,
			with an open cockpit... and with
			the right speed capabilities...
			and then you know I had to get a
			really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

				OBI-WAN
			If you'd spend as much time
			working on your saber skills as
			you do on your wit, young Padawan,
			you would rival Master Yoda as a
			swordsman.

				ANAKIN
			I thought I already did.

				OBI-WAN
			Only in your mind, my very young
			apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, I forgot you don't like
			flying, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't mind flying... but
			what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

				ANAKIN
			Master, you know I've been flying
			since before I could walk. I'm very
			good at this.

				OBI-WAN
			Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			You know I don't like it when you
			do that!

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
			guy's gonna kill himself any
			minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			What are you doing? He's gonna
			blast me!

				ANAKIN
			Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

				OBI-WAN
			That was too close!

				ANAKIN
			Clear that!

				OBI-WAN
			What??

				ANAKIN
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

				OBI-WAN
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
			don't  like it when you do that!

				ANAKIN
			So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

				OBI-WAN
			It's dangerous near those power
			couplings! Slow down! Don't go
			through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Yiiii, what are you doing?

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master!

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastically)
			Oh, that was good...

				ANAKIN
			That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Ahh, damn.

				OBI-WAN
			Stop!!

				ANAKIN
			No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
			crazy.

				ANAKIN
			But it worked... we made it.

				OBI-WAN
				(angrily)
			It didn't work... we've stalled!
			And you almost got us killed!

				ANAKIN
			I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

				OBI-WAN
				(very angrily)
			It was stupid!

				ANAKIN
				(sheepishly)
			I could have made it...

				OBI-WAN
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

				ANAKIN
			No we didnt...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

				OBI-WAN
			Where are you going?! He went
			down there, the other way.

				ANAKIN
			This is a shortcut... I think.

				OBI-WAN
			What do you mean, You think?
			What kind of shortcut?! He went
			completely the other way! Youve
			lost him!

				ANAKIN
			Master, if we keep this chase
			going, that creeps gonna end up
			deep fried. Personally, Id very
			much like to find out who in the
			hell he is and who hes working
			for...

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so thats why were going in
			the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.

				ANAKIN
			Im deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

				ANAKIN
			She went into that club, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			 	(continuing)
			Here. Next time try not to lose it.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

				OBI-WAN
			A Jedi's saber is his most
			precious possession.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

				OBI-WAN
			He must keep it with him at all
			times.

				ANAKIN
			I know, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			This weapon is your life!

				ANAKIN
			I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

				OBI-WAN
			But, you haven't learned anything,
			Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

				OBI-WAN
			Why do I think you are going to be
			the death of me?!

				ANAKIN
			Don't say that Master... You're
			the closest thing I have to a
			father... I love you. I don't want
			to cause you pain.

				OBI-WAN
			Then why don't you listen to me?!

				ANAKIN
			I will. I'll do better, I promise.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you see him him?

				ANAKIN
			I think he's a she...

				OBI-WAN
			Then be extra careful...
				(nods to a room)
			Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

				ANAKIN
			Where are you going, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

				OBI-WAN
			You don't want to sell me death-
			sticks.

				ELAN
			I don't want to sell you death-
			sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

				OBI-WAN
			You want to go home and rethink 
			your life.

				ELAN
			I want to go home and rethink my
			life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

				ANAKIN
			Easy... Official business. Go
			back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know who it was you were
			trying to kill?

				ZAM WESSEL
			The Senator from Naboo.

				OBI-WAN
			Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

				ZAM WESSEL
			It was just a job.

				ANAKIN
			Tell us!

				ZAM WESSEL
			That Senator's gonna die soon
			anyway, and the next one won't
			make the same mistake I did...

				OBI-WAN
			This wound's going to need
			treatment.

				ANAKIN
			Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
			now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

				ZAM
			It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

				OBI-WAN
			Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S 
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

				PADMÉ
			Representative Binks. I know I can
			count on you.

				JAR JAR
			Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

				PADMÉ
			What?!

				JAR JAR
				(coughs, recovers)
			Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
			I am honoured to accept this heavy
			burden. I take on this
			responsibility with deep humility
			tinged with an overwhelming pride.
				(pompously)
			It is not every day that I am
			called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

				PADMÉ
			You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
			don't wish to hold you up. I'm
			sure you have a great deal to do.

				JAR JAR
			Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

				PADMÉ
			I do not like this idea of hiding.

				ANAKIN
			Don't worry. Now that the Council
			has ordered an investigation, it
			won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
			find that bounty hunter.

				PADMÉ
				(frustrated)
			I haven't worked for a year to
			defeat the "Military Creation Act"
			not to be here when its fate is
			decided.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes we have to let go of our
			pride and do what is requested of
			us.

				PADMÉ
			Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
			you don't have a very firm grip on
			politics. I suggest you reserve
			your opinions for some other time.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
			to...

				PADMÉ
			Annie! No!

				ANAKIN
			Please don't call me that.

				PADMÉ
			What?

				ANAKIN
			Annie...

				PADMÉ
			I've always called you that... it
			is your name, isn't it?

				ANAKIN
			It's Anakin. When you say Annie
			it's like I'm still a little
			boy... and I'm not.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
			to deny you've...
				(looks him over)
			...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

				ANAKIN
			Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
			it...

				PADMÉ
			Mentors have a way of seeing more
			of our faults than we would like.
			It's the only way we grow.

				ANAKIN
			Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
			a great mentor. As wise as Master
			Yoda and as powerful as Master
			Windu. I am truly thankful to be
			his apprentice. Only... although
			I'm a Padawan learner, in some
			ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
			of him. I'm ready for the trials.
			I know I am! He knows it too. He
			believes I'm too unpredictable...
			Other Jedi my age have gone
			through the trials and made it...
			I know I started my training
			late... but he won't let me move
			on.

				PADMÉ
			That must be frustrating.

				ANAKIN
			It's worse... he's overly
			critical. He never listens! He
			just doesn't understand! It's not
			fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
			like that little boy I once knew,
			when he didn't get his way.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

				PADMÉ
			I didn't say it to hurt you.

				ANAKIN
			I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Don't try to grow up too fast.

				ANAKIN
			I am grown up. You said it
			yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

				PADMÉ
			Please don't look at me like that.

				ANAKIN
			Why not?

				PADMÉ
			Because I can see what you're
			thinking.

				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
			too?

DORME is watching with concern.

				PADMÉ
			It makes me feel uncomfortable.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Be safe, m'lady.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Captain. Take good
			care of Dorme... the threat's on
			you two now.

				DORME
			He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

				PADMÉ
			You'll be fine.

				DORME
			It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
			about you. What if they realise
			I'm not you?

				PADMÉ
				(looks to Anakin)
			Then my Jedi protector will have
			to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
			Do not attract any attention. Do
			absolutely nothing without
			checking in with me or the Council.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Padme)
			I will get to the bottom of this
			plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
			back here in no time.

				PADMÉ
			I will be most grateful for your
			speed, Master Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Time to go.

				PADMÉ
			I know. 

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

				OBI-WAN
			May the Force be with you.

				ANAKIN
			May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

				PADMÉ
			Suddenly, I'm afraid...

				ANAKIN
			I'm kinda scared too. This is my
			first assignment on my own.

				PADMÉ
			There's nothing to worry about...
			we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the 
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

				OBI-WAN
			I hope he doesn't try anything
			foolish.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'd be more concerned about her
			doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

				PK-4
			Place the subject for analysis on
			the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a toxic dart. I need to know
			where it came from and who made it.

				PK-4
			One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

				PK-4
				(continuing)
			As you can see on your screen,
			subject weapon does not exist in
			any known culture. Markings
			cannot be identified. Probablt
			self-made by a warrior not
			associated with any known society.

				OBI-WAN
			Excuse me? Could you try again
			please?

				PK-4
			Master Jedi, our records are very
			thorough. they cover eight
			percent of the galaxy. If I can't
			tell you where it came from,
			nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

				OBI-WAN
			Thanks for your assistance! You
			may not be able to figure this
			out, but I think I know someone
			who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

				SERVER
			Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

				FOOD SERVER
				(continuing)
			Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

				ANAKIN
			No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			What?

				PADMÉ
			You seemed to be having a
			nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Are you hungry?

				ANAKIN
			Thank you.

				PADMÉ
			We went into lightspeed a while
			ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

				ANAKIN
			I look forward to seeing Naboo
			again. I've thought about it every
			day since I left. It's by far the
			most beautiful place I've ever
			seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

				PADMÉ
			You were just a little boy then.
			It may not be as you remember it;
			time changes your perception.

				ANAKIN
			I think time has given me much
			more mature feelings to enhance my
			perception.

				PADMÉ
			It must be difficult having sworn
			your life to the Jedi... not being
			able to visit the places you
			like... or do the things you
			like...

				ANAKIN
			Or be with the people I love.

				PADMÉ
			Are you allowed to love? I
			thought that was forbidden for a
			Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Attachment is forbidden.
			Possession is forbidden.
			Compassion, which I would define
			as unconditional love, is central
			to a Jedi's life, so you might say
			we're encouraged to love.

				PADMÉ
			You have changed so much

				ANAKIN
			You haven't changed a bit. You're
			exactly the way I remember you in
			my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
			changed much either.

				PADMÉ
			It hasn't...

				ANAKIN
			I can't wait to breathe the sweet
			breeze that comes off the rolling
			hills. Whenever I try to
			visualise the Force, those hills
			are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

				PADMÉ
				(changing the subject)
			Were you dreaming about you
			mother earlier, weren't you?

				ANAKIN
			Yes... I left Tatooine so long
			ago, my memory of her is fading.
			I don't want to lose it. Recently
			I've been seeing her in my
			dreams... vivid dreams... scary
			dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

				HERMIONE
			Can I help ya?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Waddya want him for?

				OBI-WAN
			He's not in trouble. It's
			personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Someone to see ya, honey
				(lowering her voice)
			A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			You want a cup of ardees?

				OBI-WAN
			Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Hey, ol' buddy!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			So, my friend. What can I do for
			ya?

				OBI-WAN
			You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(continuing)
			I ain't seen one of these since I
			was prospecting on Subterrel
			beyond the Outer Rim!

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			This baby belongs to them cloners.
			What you got here is a Kamino
			Kyberdart.

				OBI-WAN
			Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
			it didn't show up in any analysis
			archive.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It's these funny little cuts on
			the side give it away...
			Those analysis droids you've got
			over there only focus on symbols,
			you know. I should think you Jedi
			would have more respect for the
			difference between knowledge and
			wisdom.

				OBI-WAN
			Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
			wouldn't be here, would we?
				(laughing)
			Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
			Is it part of the Republic?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
			I'd say about twelve parsecs
			outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
			south. It should be easy to find,
			even for those droids in your
			archive to find. Those Kaminoans
			keep to themselves. They're
			cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

				OBI-WAN
			Cloners? Are they friendly?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It depends.

				OBI-WAN
			On what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			On how good your manners are...
			and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

				ANAKIN
			If I grew up here, I don't think
			I'd ever leave.

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			I doubt that.

				ANAKIN
			No, really. When I started my
			training, I was very homesick and
			very lonely. This city and my Mom
			were the only pleasant things I
			had to think about... The problem
			was, the more I thought about my
			Mom, the worse I felt. But I
			would feel better if I thought
			about the palace - the way it
			shimmers in the sunlight - the way
			the air always smells of flowers...

				PADMÉ
			...and the soft sound of the
			distant waterfalls. The first
			time I saw the Capital, I was very
			young... I'd never seen a
			waterfall before. I though they
			were so beautiful... I never
			dreamed one day I'd live in the
			palace.

				ANAKIN
			Well, tell me, did you dream of
			power and politics when you were
			a little girl?

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			No! That was the last thing I
			thought of. My dream was to help
			in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
			I never thought of running for
			elected office. But the more
			history I studied, the more I
			realised how much good politicians
			could do. So when I was eight, I
			joined the "Apprentice
			Legislators", then later on became
			a Senatorial advisor, with such a
			passion that, before I knew it, I
			was elected Queen. Partly because
			I scored so high on my education
			certificate, but for the most part
			it was my conviction that reform
			was possible. I wasn't the
			youngest Queen ever elected, but
			now that I think back on it, I'm
			not sure I was old enough. I'm not
			sure I was ready.

				ANAKIN
			The people you served thought you
			did a good job. I heard they
			tried to amend the Constitution so
			you could stay in office.

				PADMÉ
			Popular rule is not democracy,
			Annie. It gives the people what
			they want, not what they need.
			And, truthfully, I was relieved
			when my two terms were up. So
			were my parents. They worried
			About me during the blockade and
			couldn't wait for it all to be
			over. Actually, I was hoping to
			have a family by now... My
			sisters have the most amazing,
			wonderful kids... but when the
			Queen asked me to serve as
			Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

				ANAKIN
			I agree! I think the Republic
			needs you... I'm glad you chose
			to serve. I feel things are going
			to happen in our generation that
			will change the galaxy in profound
			ways.

				PADMÉ
			I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We've been worried about you.
				(takes her hand)
			I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Your Highness. I only
			Wish I could have served you
			better by staying on Coruscant for
			the vote.

				SIO BIBBLE
			Given the circumstances, Senator,
			you know it was the only decision
			Her Highness could have made.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			How many systems have joined Count
			Dooku and the separatists?

				PADMÉ
			About two hundred. And more are
			leaving the Republic every day.
			If the Senate votes to create an
			army, I'm sure it's going to push
			us into a civil war.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's unthinkable! There hasn't
			been a full-scale war since the
			formation of the Republic!

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Do you see any way, through
			negotiations, to bring the
			separatists back into the Republic?

				PADMÉ
			Not if they feel threatened. The
			separatists don't have an army,
			but if they are provoked, they
			will move to defend themselves.
			I'm sure of that. And with no time
			or money to build an army, my
			guess is they will turn to the
			Commerce Guilds or the Trade
			Federation for help.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			The armies of commerce! Why has
			Nothing been done in the Senate
			to restrain them?

				PADMÉ
			I'm afraid that, despite the
			Chancellor's best efforts, there
			are still many bureaucrats,
			judges, and even Senators on the
			payrolls of the Guilds.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's outrageous! After all of
			those hearings, and the four trials in
			the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
			still the Viceroy of the Trade
			Federation. Do those money
			mongers control everything?

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Remember, Counsellor, the courts
			were able to reduce the
			Federation's armies. That's a
			move in the right
			direction.

				PADMÉ
			There are rumours, Your Highness,
			that the Federation Army was not
			reduced as they were ordered.

				ANAKIN
			The Jedi have not been allowed to
			investigate. It would be to be too
			dangerous for the economy, we were
			told.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We must keep our faith in the
			Republic. The day we stop
			believing democracy can work is
			the day we lose it.

				PADMÉ
			Let's pray that day never comes.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			In the meantime, we must consider
			your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin)
			What is your suggestion, Master
			Jedi?

				PADMÉ
			Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
			He's still a Padawan learner. I
			was thinking...

				ANAKIN
				(nettled)
			Hey, hold on a minute!

				PADMÉ
			Excuse me! I was thinking I would
			stay in the Lake Country. There
			are some places up there that are
			very isolated.

				ANAKIN
			Excuse me?! I am in charge of
			security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

				PADMÉ
			Annie, my life is at risk, and
			this is my home. I know it very
			well... that is why we're here.
			I think it would be wise for you
			to take advantage of my knowledge
			in this instance.

				ANAKIN
				(takes a deep breath)
			Sorry, M'Lady.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin, amused)
			She is right. The Lake Country is
			the most remote part of Naboo.
			Not many people and a clear view
			of the surrounding terrain.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(continued)
			Padmé, I had an audience with your
			father yesterday. I told him what
			was happening. He hopes you will
			visit your mother before you
			leave... your family's very
			worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

				JOCASTA NU
			Did you call for assistance?

				OBI-WAN
				(distracted in thought)
			Yes... yes, I did...

				JOCASTA NU
			He has a powerful face, doesn't
			he? He was one of the most
			brilliant Jedi I have had the
			privilege of knowing.

				OBI-WAN
			I never understood why he quit.
			Only twenty Jedi have ever left
			the Order.

				JOCASTA NU
				(sighs)
			The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
			was the most recent and the most
			painful. No one likes to talk
			about it. His leaving was a great
			loss to the Order.

				OBI-WAN
			What happened?

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, one might say, he was always
			a bit out of step with the
			decisions of the Council... much
			like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

				OBI-WAN
				(surprised)
			Really?

				JOCASTA NU
			Oh, yes. They were alike in many
			ways. Very individual thinkers...
			idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing
			He was always striving to become
			a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
			to be the best. With a lightsaber,
			in the old style of fencing, he
			had no match. His knowledge of
			the Force was... unique. In the
			end, I think he left because he
			lost faith in the Republic. He
			believed that politics were
			corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
			betrayed themselves by serving the
			politicians. He always had very
			high expectations of government.
			He disappeared for nine or ten
			years, then he just showed up
			recently as the head of the
			separatist movement.

				OBI-WAN
			Interesting... I'm still not sure
			I understand.

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
			over here for a history lesson.
			Are you having a problem, Master
			Kenobi?

				OBI-WAN
			Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
			system called Kamino. It doesn't
			seem to show upon any of the
			archive charts.

				JOCASTA NU
			Kamino? It's not a system I'M
			familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing)
			Are you sure you have the right
			co-ordinates?

				OBI-WAN
				(nodding)
			According to my information, it
			should be in this quadrant
			somewhere... just south of the
			Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

				JOCASTA NU
			No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
			kind of directions you'd get from
			a street tout... some old miner or
			Furbog trader.

				OBI-WAN
			All three actually.

				JOCASTA NU
			Are you sure it exists?

				OBI-WAN
			Absolutely.

				JOCASTA NU
			Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

				JOCASTA NU
			There are some inconsistencies
			here. Maybe the planet you're
			looking for was destroyed.

				OBI-WAN
			Wouldn't that be on record?

				JOCASTA NU
			It ought to be. Unless it was very
			recent.
				(shakes her head)
			I hate to say it, but it looks
			like the system you're searching
			for doesn't exist.

				OBI-WAN
			That's impossible... perhaps the
			archives are incomplete.

				JOCASTA NU
			The archives are comprehensive and
			totally secure, my young Jedi.
			One thing you may be absolutely
			sure of - if an item does not
			appear in our records, it does not
			exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

				PADME
			There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			What? Don't say you're shy!

				ANAKIN
				(untruthfully)
			No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

				RYOO & POOJA
			Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

				PADME
			Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			I'm so happy to see you! This is
			Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
			this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

				RYOO & POOJA
			Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

				SOLA
				(over her shoulder)
			They're eating over at Jev
			Narran's later, Mom. They just
			had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

				PADME
			Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

				SOLA
			Hello, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

				JOBAL
			You're just in time for dinner. I
			hope you're hungry, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			A little.

				PADME
			He's being polite, Mom. We're
			starving.

				RUWEE
				(grinning)
			You came to the right place at the
			right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

				JOBAL
				(to Padme)
			Honey, it's so good to see you
			safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

				RUWEE
			Dear...

				JOBAL
			I know, I know... but I had to say
			it. Now it's done.

				SOLA
			Well, this is exciting! Do you
			know, Anakin, you're the first
			boyfriend my sister's ever brought
			home?

				PADME
				(rolls her eyes)
			Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
			He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
			to protect me.

				JOVAL
			A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
			didn't tell us it was that serious!

				PADME
			It's not, Mom, I promise.
				(glances at Jobal)
			Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
			known him for years. Remember
			that little boy who was with the
			Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			He grew up.

				JOBAL
			Honey, when are you going to
			settle down? Haven't you had
			enough of that life? I certainly
			have!

				PADME
			Mom, I'm not in any danger.

				RUWEE
				(to Anakin)
			Is she?

				ANAKIN
			...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

				PADME
				(quickly)
			But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

				RUWEE
			Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
			more... but I must say, I'm happy
			here.

				ANAKIN
			Padme tells me you teach at the
			university?

				RUWEE
				(nodding)
			Yes, and before that, I was a
			builder. I also worked for the
			Refugee Relief Movement, when I
			was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

				SOLA
			Why haven't you told us about him?

				PADMÉ
			What's there to talk about?  He's
			just a boy.

				SOLA
			A boy? Have you seen the way he
			looks at you?

				PADMÉ
			Sola - stop it!

				SOLA
			It's obvious he has feelings for
			you. Are you saying, little baby
			sister, that you haven't noticed?

				PADMÉ
			I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
			Anakin and I are friends... our
			relationship is strictly
			professional.
				(to Jobal)
			Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

				SOLA
				(laughing)
			Well, maybe you haven't noticed
			the way he looks at you. I think
			you're afraid to.

				PADMÉ
			Cut it out.

				JOBAL
			Sola's just concerned... we all
			are.

				PADMÉ
			Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
			I'm doing is important.

				JOBAL
			You've done your service, Padmé.
			It's time you had a life of your
			own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

				RUWEE
			Now tell me, son. How serious is
			this thing? How much danger is my
			daughter really in?

				ANAKIN
			There have been two attempts on
			her life. Chances are there'll be
			more. My Master is tracking down
			the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
			out who they are. This situation,
			won't last long.

				RUWEE
			I don't want anything to happen to
			her.

				ANAKIN
			I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

				PADME
			Don't worry, this won't take long.

				ANAKIN
			I just want to get there before
			dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			You still live at home.

				PADME
			I move around so much, I've never
			had a place of my own. Official
			residences have no warmth. I feel
			good here. I feel at home.

				ANAKIN
			I never had a real home. Home was
			always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

				PADME
			That was when I went with the
			Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
			Their sun was imploding, and the
			planet was dying. I was helping
			to relocate the children. See
			that little one I'm holding? His
			name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
			sweethear. He was so full of 
			life,. All those kids were. I did
			everything I could to save him,
			but he died... they all did. They
			were never able to adapt... to
			live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			My first day as an Apprentice
			Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

				YODA
			Don't think... feel... be as one
			with the Force. Help you, it will.
				(he sees Obi-Wan)
			Younglings - enough! A visitor we
			have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
			mighty Bear Clan.

				CHILDREN
			Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

				YODA
			What help to you, can I be?

				OBI-WAN
			Im looking for a planet described
			to me by an old friend. I trust
			him. But the system doesnt show
			up on the archive maps.

				YODA
			An interesting puzzle. Gather
			round the map reader, younglings.
			Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
			Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

				OBI-WAN
			This is where it ought to be...
			but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
			all the stars in this area inward
			to this spot. There should be a
			star here... but there isnt.

				YODA
			Most interesting. Gravitys
			silhouette remains, but the star
			and all its planets have
			disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

				JEDI CHILD JACK
			Because someone erased it from the
			archive memory.

				CHILDREN
			Thats right! Yes! Thats what
			happened! Someone erased it!

				JEDI CHILD MAY
			If the planet blew up, the gravity
			would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

				YODA
			Truly wonderful, the mind of a
			child is. Uncluttered. To the
			centre of the pull of gravity go,
			and find your planet you will.

				OBI-WAN
			But Master Yoda who could have
			erased information from the
			archives? Thats impossible,
			isnt it?

				YODA
				(frowning)
			Much harder to answer, that
			question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

				PADMÉ
			When I was in Level Three, we used
			to come here for school retreat.
			See that island? We used to swim
			there every day. I love the water.

				ANAKIN
			I do too. I guess it comes from
			growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

				PADMÉ
			...We used to lie on the sand and
			let the sun dry us... and try to
			guess the names of the birds
			singing.

				ANAKIN
			I dont like sand. Its coarse
			and rough and irritating, and it
			gets everywhere. Not like here.
			Here everythings soft... and
			smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

				PADMÉ
			There was a very old man who lived
			on the island. He used to make
			glass out of sand - and vases and
			necklaces out of the glass. They
			were magical.

				ANAKIN
				(looks into her eyes)
			Everything here is magical.

				PADMÉ
			You could look into the glass and
			see the water. The way it ripples
			and moves. It looked so real...
			but it wasnt.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes, when you believe
			something to be real, it becomes
			real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

				PADMÉ
			I used to think if you looked too
			deeply into glass, you would
			lose yourself.

				ANAKIN
			I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

				PADMÉ
			I shouldn't have done that.

				ANAKIN
			I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
			my mind is no longer my own.

				PADMÉ
			It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

				MACE WINDU
			Be wary, this disturbance in the
			Force is growing stronger.

				OBI-WAN
			I am concerned for my Padawan. He
			is not ready to be on his own.

				YODA
			The Council is confident in this decision,
			Obi-Wan.

				MACE
			He has exceptional skills. The
			Council is confident in its
			decision, Obi-Wan. If the
			prophecy is true, he weill be the
			one to bring balance to the Force.

				OBI-WAN
			But he still has much to learn.
			And his abilities have made him...
			well... arrogant. I realise now
			what you and Master Yoda knew from
			the beginning... the boy was too
			old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

				MACE WINDU
			There's something else?

				OBI-WAN
			Master, he should not have been
			given this assignment. I'm afraid
			Anakin won't be able to protect
			the Senator. 

				MACE WINDU
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			He has a... an emotional
			connection with her. It's been
			there since he was boy. Now
			he's confused... distracted.

				MACE-WINDU
			Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
			he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

				OBI-WAN
			Has Master Yoda gained any insight
			into whether or not this war will
			come about?

				MACE WINDU
			Probing the Dark Side is a
			dangerous process. He could be in
			seclusion for days... May the
			force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

				PADME
			You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

				ANAKIN
			What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

				PADME
			That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not really supposed to do
			that... for fun, I mean. If
			Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
			very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

				ANAKIN
			May I tell you something?

				PADME
			I don't know.

				ANAKIN
			Then how can I tell you?

				PADME
			Maybe you should use your Jedi
			intuition.

				ANAKIN
			It doesn't work around you. My
			mind is always a muddle... I can
			only think of you.

				PADME
			Anakin, don't...

				ANAKIN
			From the moment I met you, all
			those years ago, a day hasn't gone
			by when I haven't thought of you.
			And now that I'm close to you again,
			I'm in agony. The closer I get to
			you, the worse it gets. The
			thought of not being with you
			mskes my stomach turn over - my
			mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
			can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
			kiss you should never have given
			me. My heart is beating, hoping
			that kiss will not become a scar.
			You are in my very soul,
			tormenting me. What can I do? I
			will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			If you are suffering as much as I
			am, tell me.

				PADME
			...I can't. We can't. It's just
			not possible.

				ANAKIN
			Anything's possible. Padme,
			please listen...

				PADME
			You listen. We live in a real
			world. Come back to it. You're
			studying to become a Jedi Knight.
			I'm a Senator. If you follow your
			thoughts through to conclusion,
			they will take us to a place we
			cannot go... regardless of the way
			we feel about each other.

				ANAKIN
			Then you do feel something!
			There's an extraordinary
			connection between us. You can't
			deny that.

				PADME
			Annie, it doesn't make any
			difference. Jedi aren't allowed
			to marry. You swore an oath,
			remember? You'd be expelled from
			the Order. I will not let you
			give up your responsibilities...
			your future, for me.

				ANAKIN
			I was destined to be a Jedi. I
			don't think I could be anything
			else. But you are asking me to be
			rational. That is something I
			know I cannot do. I wish I could
			wish my feelings away... but I
			can't.

				PADME
			I am not going to give into this.
			I'm not going to throw my life
			away. I have more important things
			to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

				ANAKIN
			It wouldn't have to be that way...
			we could keep it a secret.

				PADME
			Then we'd be living a lie - one we
			couldn't keep even if we wanted
			to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
			mother. I couldn't do that.
			Could you, Anakin? Could you live
			like that?

Silence for a moment.

				ANAKIN
			...No, you're right. It would
			destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
			Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

				TAUN WE
			Everything is ready. The Prime
			Minister expects you.

				OBI-WAN
				(warily)
			I'm expected?

				TAUN WE
			Of course! He is anxious to see
			you. After all these years, we
			were beginning to think you
			weren't coming. Now please, this
			way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

				TAUN WE
			May I present Lama Su, Prime
			Minister of Kamino... and this is
			Master Jedi...

				OBI-WAN
			Obi-Wan Kenobi.

				LAMA SU
			Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

				LAMA SU
			I trust you are going to enjoy
			your stay. We are most happy you
			have arrived at the best part of
			the season.

				OBI-WAN
			You make me feel most welcome.

				LAMA SU
			And now to business. You will be
			delighted to hear we are on
			schedule. Two hundred thousand
			units are ready, with another
			million well on the way.

				OBI-WAN
				(improvising)
			That is... good news.

				LAMA SU
			Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
			that we have every confidence his
			order will be met on time and in
			full. He is well, I hope?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sorry Master - ?

				LAMA SU
			Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
			a leading member of the Jedi
			Council, is he not?

				OBI-WAN
			Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

				LAMA SU
				(rising)
			You must be anxious to inspect the
			units for yourself.

				OBI-WAN
			That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

				PADMÉ
			I don't know...

				ANAKIN
			Sure you do... you just don't want
			to tell me.

				PADMÉ
			Are you going to use one of your
			Jedi mind tricks on me?

				ANAKIN
			They only work on the weak-minded.
			You are anything but weak-minded.

				PADMÉ
			All right... his name was Palo.
			I was twelve. We were both in the
			Legislative Youth Program. He was
			a few years older then I... very
			cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
			eyes.

				ANAKIN
			All right, I get the picture...
			whatever happened to him?

				PADMÉ
			I went on to become a Queen. He
			went on to become an artist.

				ANAKIN
			Maybe he was the smart one.

				PADME
			You really don't like politicians,
			do you?

				ANAKIN
			I like two or three, but I'm not
			really sure about one of them.
				(smiling)
			I don't think the system works.

				PADME
			How would you have it work?

				ANAKIN
			We need a system where the
			politicians sit down and discuss
			the problems, agree what's in the
			best interests of all the people,
			and then do it.

				PADME
			That is exactly what we do. The
			trouble is that people don't
			wlways agree. In fact, they
			hardly ever do.

				ANAKIN
			Then they should be made to.

				PADME
			By whom? Who's going to make them?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know. Someone.

				PADME
			You?

				ANAKIN
			Of course not me.

				PADME
			But someone.

				ANAKIN
			Someone wise.

				PADME
			That sounds an awful lot like a
			dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

				ANAKIN
			Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

				PADMÉ
			You're making fun of me.

				ANAKIN
			 	(sarcastic)
			On no, I'd be much too frightened
			to tease a Senator.

				PADMÉ
			You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

				ANAKIN
			You're always so serious. Always
			carrying the weight of the
			universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

				LAMA SU
				(beaming)
			Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

				LAMA SU
			We modified their genetic
			structure to make them less
			independent than the original
			host. As a result they are
			totally obedient, taking any order
			without question.

				OBI-WAM
			Who was the original host?

				LAMA SU
			A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
			We felt a Jedi would be the
			perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
			picked Jango Fett himself.

				OBI-WAN
			Where is this bounty hunter now?

				LAMA SU
			Oh, we keep him here. After a few
			hundred thousand clones, the
			genetic pattern starts to fade, so
			we take a fresh supply. He lives
			here, but he's free to come and go
			as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

				LAMA SU
			Apart from his pay, which is
			considerable, Fett demanded only
			one thing - an unaltered clone for
			himself. Curious isn't it?

				OBI-WAN
			Unaltered?

				LAMA SU
			Pure genetic replication. No
			tampering with the structure to
			make it more docile... and no
			growth acceleration...

				OBI-WAN
			I would like to meet this Jango
			Fett.

				TAUN WE
			I would be most happy to arrange
			it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			You mentioned growth
			acceleration...

				LAMA SU
			Oh yes, it's essential.
			Otherwise, a mature clone would
			take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
			can do it in half the time. Those
			items you saw on the parade ground
			were started ten years ago, when
			Sido-dyas first placed the order,
			and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			And these?

				LAMA SU
			About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

				LAMA SU
			They're immensely superior to
			droids, capable of independent
			thought and action.

				OBI-WAN
			Very impressive.

				LAMA SU
			I'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

				OBI-WAN
				(carefully)
			Tell me, prime minister, when my
			Master Sido-dyas first contacted
			you, did he say the order was
			for... himself... or?

				LAMA SU
			Himself? Of course not. This
			army is for the Republic?

				OBI-WAN
				(astonished)
			The Repubic?

				LAMA SU
			We are also very much agasint this
			Count Dooku and his seccessionist
			movement. We are proud to be of
			help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

				TAUN WE
			I have arranged for you to meet
			Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
			well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
			five," to Courscant: care of "the
			old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I've never heard of a Jedi
			called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

				MACE WINDU
			No. Whoever placed that order was
			not a Jedi, I can assure you.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I have a strong feeling that this
			bounty hunter is the assassin
			we're looking for.

				YODA
			Who he is working for... discover
			that, you must.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I will, Master, and I will also
			find out more about this clone
			army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

				WINDU 
			A clone army! Ordered by someone
			in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
			out to start a war.

				YODA
			Inform the chancellor of this, we
			must.

				WINDU
			Who do you think this impostor
			Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

				ANAKIN
			No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
			no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

				ANAKIN
				(eyes closed)
			Don't go.

				PAMDE
			I don't want to disturb you.

				ANAKIN
			Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

				PADME
			You had a nightmare again last
			night.

				ANAKIN
			Jedi don't have nightmares.

				PADME
			I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			I saw my mother. I saw her as
			clearly as I see you now. She's
			suffering, Padme. She is in
			pain...They're killing her!
				(getting up)
			I know I'm disobeying my mandate
			to protect you, Senator. I know I
			will be punished and possibly
			thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
			I must go. I have to help her!
			I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
			choice.

				PADME
			Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
			you give up your future for me.
			I'll go with you. That way you
			can continue to protect me, and
			you won't be disobeying your
			mandate.

				ANAKIN
			What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

				PADME
			I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

				TAUN WE
			Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

				TAUN WE
				(continuing)
			May we see him?

				BOBA FETT
			Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome back, Jango. Was your
			trip productive?

				JANGO FETT
			Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

				TAUN WE
			This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
			Kenobi. He's come to check on our
			progress.

				JANGO FETT
			That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

				OBI-WAN
			Your clones are very impressive.
			You must be very proud.

				JANGO FETT
			I'm just a simple man, trying to
			make my way in the universe,
			Master Jedi.

				OBI-WAN
			Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Ever made your way as far into the
			interior as Coruscant?

				JANGO
			Once or twice.

				OBI-WAN
			Recently?

				JANGO
				(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
			Possibly...

				OBI-WAN
			Then you must know Master Sido-
			Dyas?

				JANGO
			Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

				JANGO
				(continuing)
			Master who?

				OBI-WAN
			Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
			hired you for this job?

				JANGO
			Never heard of him. I was
			recuited by a man called Darth
			Tyranus on one of the moons of
			Bogden.

				OBI-WAN
			No? I thought...

				TAUN WE
			Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
			And he showed up just when your
			Jedi Master said he would. We
			have kept the Jedis involvement
			a secret until your arrival, just
			as your Master requested.

				OBI-WAN
			Curious...

				JANGO
			Do you like your army?

				OBI-WAN
			It seems to me it's your army -
			being that they are all clones of
			you.

				JANGO
				(grinning)
			They'll do their job well, I'll
			guarantee that.

				OBI-WAN
			I look forward to seeing them in
			action. Thank you for your time,
			Jango.

				JANGO
			Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

				BOBA
			What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

				ANAKIN
				(to the droid driver)
			Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

				WATTO
				(yelling, in Huttese)
			No, not that one - that one!

				ANAKIN
				(arriving)
			Excuse me, Watto.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			What?

				ANAKIN
				(in Huttese)
			I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

				WATTO
				(continuing, in Huttese)
			What? I don't know you... What can
			I do for you? You look like a
			Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
			do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

				ANAKIN
			Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

				WATTO
			Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

				WATTO
				(continuing; in English)
			You are Annie! It is you! You
			little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

				WATTO
				(continuing)
			You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
			Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
			you couldda help wit some
			daedbeats who owe...

				ANAKIN
			My mother...

				WATTO
			Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
			no more. I sold her.

				ANAKIN
			Sold her...

				WATTO
			Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
			know, business is business.
			Sold her to a moisture farmer
			named Lars. Least I think it was
			Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
			he freed her and married her. Can
			ya beat that?

				ANAKIN
			Do you know where they are?

				WATTO
			Long way from here... someplace
			over on the other side of Mos
			Eisley, I think...

				ANAKIN
			I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

				WATTO
			Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
			go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

				LAMA SU
			Tell your Council the first
			battalions are ready. And remind
			them that if they need more
			troops, we will need time to grow
			them.

				OBI-WAN
			I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

				PADME
			Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

				C-3PO
			Good evening. May I help you?

				ANAKIN
			Threepio?

				C-3PO
			Oh, my... oh, my! Master
			Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
			believe it! And this must be Miss
			Padme.

				PADME
			Hello, Threepio.

				ANAKIN
			I've come to see my mother.

				C-3PO
			Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
			Master Annie.

				PADME
			Threepio, what's happened?

				C-3PO
			I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

				C-3PO
			Master Lars - Master Owen!
			Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

				ANAKIN
			I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
			looking for my mother.

				OWEN
			Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
			step-brother.
				(they shake hands)
			This is my girlfriend, Beru.

				BERU
			Hello.

				PADME
			I'm Padme.

				OWEN
			I had a feeling you might show up
			some day.

				ANAKIN
			Is my mother here?

				CLIEGG
			No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
			Come on inside. We have a lot to
			talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			It was just before dawn. They
			came out of nowhere. A hunting
			party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

				CLIEGG
			Your mother had gone out early,
			like she always did, to pick
			mushrooms that grow on the
			vaporatos. From the tracks, she
			was about halfway when they
			took her. Those Tuskens walk like
			men, but they're vicious, mindless
			monsters. Thirty of us went out
			after her. Four of us came back.
			Three more are still out there
			looking. I'd be with them,
			only... I just couldn't ride any
			more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			This isn't the way I wanted to
			meet you, son. This isn't how
			your mother and I planned it. I
			don't want to give up on her, but
			she's been gone a month. There's
			little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

				OWEN
			Where are you going?

				ANAKIN
			To find my mother.

				PADME
			No, Annie!

				CLIEGG
			She's daed, son. Accept it.

				ANAKIN
			I can feel her pain, and I will
			find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

				ANAKIN
			You are going to have to stay
			here. These are good people,
			Padme. You'll be safe.

				OWEN
			Take my speeder bike.

				PADME
			Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

				ANAKIN
			I trust you'll watch over her,
			Owen.

				OWEN
			Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

				ANAKIN
			I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

				JANGO FETT
			Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

				JANGO FETT
			Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Watch out!

				JANGO FETT
			Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
			That Jedi won't be able to follow
			us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

				BOBA FETT
			Got him! Yeahhhhh!

				JANGO FETT
			We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

				C-3PO
			Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
			These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

				PADME
			I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
			can't sleep.

				C-3PO
			That's something I cannot relate
			to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
			either active or inactive.
			There's no in-between.

				PADME
			I guess you're lucky.

				C-3PO
			Do you really think so..? I
			suppose I shouldn't expect...

				PADME
			You're not happy here?

				C-3PO
			Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
			masters here ar so kind I
			wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
			it's just... being like this...
			well, it's embarrassing.

				PADME
			Being like what?

				C-3PO
			Naked. If you pardon the
			expression. You see, when Master
			Annie made me, he never quite
			found the time to give me any
			outer covering. It's so
			humiliating. How would you like it
			if you had to go around with all
			your circuits showing?

				PADME
			I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

				C-3PO
			Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
			would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

				PADME
			Maybe we can do something about it.

				C-3PO
			I don't think so. Only Master
			Annie...

				PADME
			Why not? They seem to have a box
			of old coverings here.

				C-3PO
			Oh? How observant of you, Miss
			Padme. Of course, I'm just not
			mechanically minded... if you see
			what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

				PADME
			Let's see, if we put this...
			here...

				C-3PO
			Ooooh! That's tickles.

				PADME
			You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
			Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

				ANAKIN
			Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

				SHMI
			Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

				ANAKIN
			Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang
			on. Im going to get you out of
			here...

				SHMI
			Im so glad... to see you,
			Annie... Now... I am complete...

				ANAKIN
			Just stay with me, Mom. Im going
			to make you well again.
			Everythings going to be fine.

				SHMI
			You look so handsome. My son...
			my grown-up son. Im so proud of
			you, Annie... so proud... I missed
			you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakins lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			"Guiding light" to "old folks
			home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

				OBI-WAN
			...Starships from the Trade
			Federation and the Commerce Guilds
			are taking deliveries of battle
			droids from the foundries on
			Geonosis.

				BAIL ORGANA
			That's outrageous! The treaty
			forbids the Trade Federation from
			building up an army. What are
			they doing?!

				OBI-WAN
			The droid foundry seems to be
			working at full capacity. I am
			going to go down and investigate.
			I will bring Jango Fett back home
			for interrogation.

				PALPATINE
			Those Geonosian foundries are part
			of the Techno Union. We will call
			in their representatives and ask
			them a few very pointed questions.

				OBI-WAN
			One more thing. Jango mentioned
			he was recruited by someone named
			Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
			might be?

				YODA
			With the forename Darth, a Sith he
			must be.

				MACE WINDU
			Our missing apprentice. They are
			playing their hand at last.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you believe he could be the
			mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
			deal for the clone army?

				YODA
			Perhaps too many pieces are missing
			from this puzzle, there are.

				MACE WINDU
			Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
			investigation is becoming less
			than routine. Do you need help?

				OBI-WAN
			Let me see if I can figure out
			what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

				BAIL ORGANA
			The Commerce Guilds are preparing
			for war... there can be no doubt
			of that.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku must have made a
			treaty with them.

				MACE WINDU
			We must stop them soon before
			they're fully ready.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			The debate is over, we need
			that clone army now!

				BAIL ORGANA
			Unfortunately, the debate is not
			over. The Senate will never be
			able to approve the use of that
			army before the separatists
			attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

				MAS AMEDDA
			This is a crisis! If the Senate
			votes the Chancellor emergency
			powers, he could approve the use
			of the army in a minute.

				PALPATINE
			Please, please, I don't wish to
			have emergency powers. That's too
			extreme a solution. It's akin to
			a dictatorship. We must rely on
			the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
			are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

				YODA
			Two Hundred,... less or more.

				BAIL ORGANA
			With all due respect for the Jedi
			Order, two hundred will be no
			match for hundreds of thousands of
			battle droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Patience. We should wait for Obi-
			Wan to report back. We don't know
			that Count Dooku has made a treaty
			with the Corporate Alliance, it's
			speculation.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			But we must prepare for the worst.
			I'm going to propose a motion
			granting emergency powers to the
			Chancellor at the next session. We
			must not wait!

				PALPATINE
			Out of the question, Senator! You
			and I are too closely aligned.
			The issue will become partisan and
			debates will begin. The proposal
			must come from a neutral source.

				MAS AMEDDA
			If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

				JAR JAR
			Supreme Chancellor... my august
			colleagues, I would be proud to
			propose the motion in question.
			This is a grave situation, and I'm
			sure Senator Amidala, and the
			Queen of Naboo would agree.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

				PALPATINE
			If called upon, I will serve. But
			it will be the saddest day of my
			life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

				PADME
			There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

				C-3PO
			Um. How do I look?

				OWEN
			Great! You look perfect.

				C-3PO
			Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
			happy!
				(extending his hand to shake hers)
			Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

				THREEPIO
				(continuing)
			Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

				OWEN
				(grinning)
			Well, Padme, I think he should be
			yours from now on... I know that
			is what my Mom would want.

				C-3PO
			Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

				BERU (V.O.)
			Come topside, everybody! He's
			back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

				OBI-WAN
			...Alliance have pledged their
			armies to Count Dooku and are
			forming an... Wait!... ah...
			attack... I don't... make it...
			aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

				ANAKIN
			I'm going after him!

				PADME
			I thought the first thing he said
			was to retransmit his message to
			Coruscant.

				ANAKIN
			Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

				MACE WINDU
			We will deal with Count Dooku. The
			most important thing for you,
			Anakin, is to stay where you are.
			Protect the Senator at all costs.
			That is your priority.

				ANAKIN
			Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

				PADME
			They'll never get there in time to
			save him. They have to come half
			way across the galaxy. Look,
			Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

				ANAKIN
			If he's still alive.

				PADME
			Annie, are you just going to sit
			here and let him die?? He's your
			friend... your mentor...

				ANAKIN
			...He's like my father, but you
			heard Master Windu. He gave me
			strict orders to stay here.

				PADME
			He gave you strict orders to
			protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
			So if you plan to protect me, you
			will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

				MACE WINDU
			The longer we wait, the stronger
			Dooku's armies become. We cannot
			wait for the Senate to make up its
			mind about granting the Chancellor
			emergency powers, in order to be
			able to use that clone army... We
			have the authority to go now. We
			must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

				YODA
			Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
			Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
			they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

				PALPATINE
			In the regrettable absence of
			Senator Amidala, the chair
			recognises Senior
			Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
			Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

				JAR JAR
			Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! The Senate will accord the
			Representative the courtesy of a
			hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

				JAR JAR
			In response to the direct threat
			to the Republic from the
			Confederacy of Independent
			Systems, I propose that the Senate
			gives immediate emergency powers to
			the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			Who can deny these are exceptional
			times? Exceptional times demand
			exceptional measures!
			Exceptional measures demand
			exceptional men!

				ORN FREE TAA
			We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

				JAR JAR
			That is the sentiment every one of
			us agrees with! And when the
			shadow of war has dispersed and
			the bright day of liberty has
			dawned once again, the power we now
			give to the Supreme Chancellor
			will be gladly, and swiftly
			returned. Out ancient liberties
			will be restored to us, burnished
			even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great reluctance that
			I have agreed to this calling. I
			love democracy... I love the
			Republic. The fact that this
			crisis is demanding I be given
			absolute power to tule over you is
			evident. But I am mild by nature
			and have no desire to destroy
			the democratic process. The power you
			give me I will lay down when this
			crisis has abated, I promise you.
			And all I ask in return is when my
			current term of office is over,
			you allow me to reture and live
			out my life in peace.

				MAS AMEDDA
			We shall proceed to the vote. All
			those in favor of granting
			emergency powers to the Supreme
			Chancellor, signal ate at this
			time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

				ANAKIN
			Hey, where are you going?

				PADME
			To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

				ANAKIN
			No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

				PADME
			Let go of me!

				ANAKIN
			I'm not letting you go out there.
			It's too dangerous.

				PADMÉ
			What?!?

				ANAKIN
			It's my job to protect you. I said
			it's too dangerous. You're not
			going, and that's final!

				PADMÉ
			Don't you give me orders, Annie!
			I'm a Senator of the Galactic
			Republic. You have no authority
			to contain me, restrain me, or
			direct me! You remember your
			place, young man.
				(standing up)
			Now you can come along and protect
			me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
			confusing. One moment they're
			generating a pleasant mutual
			attraction and the next, waves of
			violent hostility. Even though
			I'm programmed to understand them,
			I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

				PADME
				(in a low voice)
			It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

				PADME
			Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Senator Amidala, I've heard so
			much about you.

				PADMÉ
			Count Dooku, I assume.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I'm delighted to meet you at
			last. We have a great deal to
			discuss, Senator. I hope you can
			keep your young Jedi under control.

				PADMÉ
			Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

				PADMÉ
			You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
			Wan Kenobi. I am formally
			requesting you turn him over to
			me, now.

				DOOKU
			He has been convicted of
			espionage, Senator, and will be
			executed. In just a few hours, I
			believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				PADMÉ
			He is an officer of the Republic.
			You can't do that.

				DOOKU
			We don't recognise the Republic
			here, Senator. But if Naboo were
			to join our Alliance, I could
			easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

				PADMÉ
			And if I don't join your
			rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
			me will also die?

				DOOKU
			I don't wish to make you to join
			our cause against your will,
			Senator, but you are a rational,
			honest representative of your
			people and I assume you want to do
			what's in their best interest.
			Aren't you fed up with the
			corruption, the bureaucrats, the
			hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
			you? Be honest, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			The ideals are still alive, Count,
			even if the institution is failing.

				DOOKU
			You believe in the same ideals we
			believe in! The same ideals we
			are striving to make prominent.

				PADMÉ
			If what you say is true, you
			should stay in the Republic and
			help Chancellor Palpatine put
			things right.

				DOOKU
			The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
			but he is incompetent. He has
			promised to cut the bureaucracy,
			but the bureaucrats are stronger
			than ever, no? Senator, the
			Republic cannot be fixed. It is
			time to start over. The
			democratic process in the Republic
			is a sham, a shell game played
			on the voters. It will not be long
			before the cult of greed, called
			the Republic, will lose even the
			pretext of democracy and freedom.

				PADMÉ
			I cannot believe that. I will not
			forsake all I have honoured and
			worked for and betray the
			Republic. I know of your treaties
			with the Trade Federation, the
			Commerce Guilds, and the others,
			Count. What is happening here is
			not government that has been
			bought out by business... it's
			business becoming government!

				DOOKU
			Are you willing to betray your Jedi
			friends? Without your co-operation
			I can do nothing to stop their
			execution.

				PADMÉ
			What is to happen to me? Am I to be
			executed also?

				DOOKU
			I wouldn't think of such an
			offence. But, there are
			individuals who have a strong
			interest in your demise, M'lady.
			It has nothing to do with
			politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
			personal, and they have already
			paid great sums to have you
			assassinated. I'm sure they will
			push hard to have you included in
			the executions. I'm sorry but if
			you are not going to co-operate, I
			must turn you over to the
			Geonosians for justice. I've done
			all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

				JANGO FETT
			I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

				DOOKU 
			You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
			my young Jedi, but you will not
			escape.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

				SUN RIT
			You have been charged and found
			guilty of Espionage.

				POGGLE
			Do you have anything to say before
			your sentence is carried out?

				PADMÉ
			You are committing an act of war,
			Archduke. I hope you are prepared
			for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

				POGGLE
			We build weapons, Senator... that
			is our business! Of course we're
			prepared!

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Get on with it. Carry out the
			sentence. I want to see her suffer.

				POGGLE
			Your other Jedi friend is waiting
			for you, Senator. Take them to
			the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

				ANAKIN
			Don't be afraid.

				PADMÉ
			I'm not afraid to die. I've been
			dying a little bit each day since
			you came back into my life.

				ANAKIN
			What are you talking about?

				PADMÉ
			I love you.

				ANAKIN
			You love me?! I thought we
			decided not to fall in love. That
			we would be forced to live a lie.
			That it would destroy our lives...

				PADMÉ
			I think our lives are about to be
			destroyed anyway. My love for you
			is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
			have no answers. I can't control
			it... and now I don't care. I
			truly, deeply love you, and before
			we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

				ANAKIN
			I have no desire to be cured of
			this love either. Long or short,
			I vow to spend the rest of my life
			with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

				OBI-WAN
			I was beginning to wonder if you
			had gotten my message.

				ANAKIN
			I retransmitted it as you
			requested, Master. Then we decided
			to come and rescue you.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like you're going a good
			job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

				SUN RIT
			The felons before you have been
			convicted of espionage against the
			Sovereign System of Geonosis.
			Their sentence of death is to be
			carried out in this public arena
			henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

				POGGLE
			Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

				ANAKIN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

				OBI-WAN
			Take the one the left. I'll
			take the one on the right.

				ANAKIN
			What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like she's already on top
			of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
			her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

				ANAKIN
			You okay?

				PADME
				(nods, gasping)
			Sure! Well, sort of.

				ANAKIN
			Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

				NUTE GUNRAY
			This isn't how it's supposed to
			be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(smiling enigmatically)
			Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
			Maybe this is the way it's
			supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

				C-3PO
			Yes, it has been rather a long
			time. Do you suppose something's
			happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
			so. It looks a very dull planet
			to me. They should be back
			shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu, how pleasant of you
			to join us. You're just in time
			for the moment of truth. I would
			think these two new boys of yours
			could use a little more training.

				MACE WINDU
			Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
			This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(to Mace Windu)
			Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
			friend. You're impossibly
			outnumbered.

				MACE WINDU
			I don't think so. One Jedi has to
			be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			It wasn't the Geonosians I was
			thinking about. How well do you
			think one Jedi will hold up
			against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

				C-3PO
			I don't hear anything.
				(Artoo beeps)
			You're scaring me! Stop imagining
			things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

				OBI-WAN
			Someone's got to - shut down -
			these droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Don't worry! It's being - taken
			care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

				PLO KOON
			We've done it! Now we have a
			chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			The system's off but they're still
			active. That's a new feature. They
			are independent of the control
			system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu!

Silence.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			You have fought gallantly. Worthy
			of recognition in the history
			archives of the Jedi Order. Now
			it is finished.
				(pauses briefly)
			Surrender - and your lives will be 
			spared.

				MACE WINDU
			We will not be hostages for you to
			barter with Dooku.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
			will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

				YODA
			Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

				YODA
			More battalions to the left.
			Encircle them we must, then
			divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

				C-3PO
			I'm sure I heard something, this
			time. Didn't you? It's probably
			just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

				OBI-WAN
			Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing; to pilot)
			Put the ship down! Down!

				OBI-WAN
			No! Forget her. We have to go
			after Dooku.

				ANAKIN
			No we're not!! Land this ship!

				OBI-WAN
			Don't let your personal feelings
			get in the way. We've got a job to
			do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			I don't care!.. Go back.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

				DROID CAPTAIN
			Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

				COUNT DOOKU
			That won't be necessary, Captain.
			Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Anakin)
			We move in together - you slowly
			on the...

				ANAKIN
			I'm taking him now!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, no!

				ANAKIN
			You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
			killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

				COUNT DOOKU
			Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
			my Jedi powers are far beyond
			yours. Now, back down.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			I have spent the last ten years
			learning to use the power of the
			Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
			greater power.

				OBI-WAN
			You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Grand Master Kenobi, you
			disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
			such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			Surely you can do better...?
				(parries)
			No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
			swordsmanship degenerated so
			quickly, or are you trying to make
			fun of me?
				(cuts)
			Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
			out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			That's brave of you, boy - but
			foolish. I would have thought
			you'd have learnt your lesson.

				ANAKIN
			I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

				COUNT DOOKU
			You have unusual powers, young
			Padawan. But not enought to save
			you this time.

				ANAKIN
			Don't bet on it!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Yoda. At last we shall
			know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

				YODA
			Count Dooku. No interest in
			contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			The end for you, Count, this is.

				COUNT DOOKU
			...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin!

PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

				CLONE CAPTAIN
			Resistance is at an end, General.
			What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			The Force is with us, my Master.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
			done well.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I bring you good news, my Lord.
			The war has begun.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Excellent. 
			 	(smiling)
			Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

				MACE WINDU
			Where is your apprentice?

				OBI-WAN
			On his way back to Naboo. He is
			escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			I must admit without the clones,
			it would not have been a victory.

				YODA
			Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Not victory, a defeat, it was...
			Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
			War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

Episode VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI

Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an 
attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of theÊvile 
gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE 
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even 
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this 
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels 
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...

PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive 
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of 
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, 
green moon of ENDOR.

An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored 
space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial 
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the 
Death Star.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT 
The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting 
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.

DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(filtered VO)
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have 
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to 
proceed.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits 
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death 
Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible 
deflector shield.

A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

OFFICER
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial 
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial 
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, 
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. 
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. 
But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.

The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only 
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this 
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the 
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

JERJERROD
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your 
presence.

VADER
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you 
back on
schedule.

The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

JERJERROD
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

JERJERROD	 (aghast)
The Emperor's coming here?

VADER
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your 
apparent lack of progress.

JERJERROD
We shall double our efforts.

VADER
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as 
I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE

A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine 
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before 
catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along 
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.

THREEPIO
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and 
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.

Artoo whistles timidly.

THREEPIO
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this 
Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.

The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

THREEPIO
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE 

Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly 
knocks on the iron door.

THREEPIO	 (instantly) 
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master 
Luke.

A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical 
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects 
the two droids.

STRANGE VOICE
Tee chuta hhat yudd!

THREEPIO
Goodness gracious me!

 Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

 THREEPIO
 Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.

The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the 
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his 
concern.

THREEPIO
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.

Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the 
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The 
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at 
one another, afraid to enter.

Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby 
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

THREEPIO 
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should 
rush into all this.

Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY

The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark 
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN 
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the 
two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. 
Artoo beeps nervously.

THREEPIO
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! 
Oh! Oh, no.

Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike 
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

BIB
Die Wanna Wanga!

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, 
Jabba the Hutt.

Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

THREEPIO	 (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
Gift, what gift?

Bib shakes his head negatively.

BIB
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, 
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the 
strange-looking alien.

THREEPIO
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.

Bib thinks about this for a moment.

THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort 
of things.

Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

BIB
Nudd Chaa.

The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed 
by the two guards.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES 
ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as 
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts 
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the 
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating 
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a 
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the 
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At 
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS 
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba 
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows 
politely.

THREEPIO
Good morning.

JABBA
Bo Shuda!

The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned 
villain.

THREEPIO
The message, Artoo, the message.

Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, 
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten 
feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.

LUKE
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke 
Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are 
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally 
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's 
life. 
(Jabba's crowd laughs) 
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which 
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant 
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: 
these two droids.

Threepio is startled by this announcement.

THREEPIO
What did he say?

LUKE	 (cont)
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.

THREEPIO
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.

Luke's hologram disappears.

Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain.

THREEPIO
We're doomed.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he 
is.

Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. 
Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a 
carbonized HAN SOLO.

THREEPIO
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR 

One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, 
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable 
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm 
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps 
pitifully.

THREEPIO
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? 
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!

A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break 
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.

10   INT BOILER ROOM

The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy 
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are 
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can 
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work 
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons 
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized 
electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.

NINEDENINE
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

THREEPIO
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

NINEDENINE
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can 
readily...

NINEDENINE
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got 
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO
Disintegrated?

NINEDENINE	 (to a Gamorrean guard)
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining 
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.

The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.

THREEPIO	 (disappearing)
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps 
angrily.

NINEDENINE
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have 
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in 
nicely.

The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured 
electronic scream.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous 
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a 
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.

Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons 
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, 
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.

JABBA
Da Eitha!

The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.

OOLA
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...

Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.

JABBA
Boscka!

He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the 
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a 
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous 
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her 
fate through a grate.

Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han 
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.ÊAn 
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the 
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two 
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his 
captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.

Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into 
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens 
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a 
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! Chewbacca!

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to 
Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.

THREEPIO
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh 
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices 
BOBA FETT standing near the door.

THREEPIO
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the 
reward of twenty-five thousand.

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I want fifty thousand. No less.

Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the 
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his 
weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the 
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.

THREEPIO
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.

The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio 
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The 
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.

THREEPIO
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the 
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the 
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba 
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across 
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.

Jabba continues.

THREEPIO
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.

Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his 
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes 
dead.

BOUSHH
Zeebuss.

THREEPIO
He agrees!

The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and 
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca 
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a 
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing 
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly 
appreciative creatures.

Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the 
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across 
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling 
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL

Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When 
a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes 
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. 
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming 
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the 
iron door.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE

The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in 
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert 
rodent and burps in satisfaction.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien 
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several 
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.

A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of 
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his 
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.

Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his 
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter 
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of 
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.

Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the 
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches 
and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization 
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the 
contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches 
as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, 
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His 
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.

Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath 
of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he 
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.

BOUSHH
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.

Han touches his face with his hand and moans.

BOUSHH
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

HAN
I can't see.

BOUSHH
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN
Where am I?

BOUSHH
Jabba's palace.

HAN
Who are you?

The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, 
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.

LEIA
Someone who loves you.

HAN
Leia!

LEIA
I gotta get you out of here.

As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is 
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.

HAN
What's that? I know that laugh.

The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the 
Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his 
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.

HAN
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I 
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.

Jabba laughs.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but 
now you're Bantha fodder.

HAN
Look...

JABBA	 (cont Huttese subtitled)
Take him away!

The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.

HAN
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. 
Don't be a fool!

Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead 
Leia away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring her to me.

Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young 
princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly 
turns away in disgust.

LEIA
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I'm sure.

Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly 
blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.

LEIA
Ugh!

THREEPIO
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL

The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A 
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door 
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack 
in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is 
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell 
door and listens.

HAN
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting 
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, 
revealing Chewie.

HAN
Ah! Chew--Chewie!

The giant Wookiee barks with glee.

HAN
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?

Chewie barks an excited blue streak.

HAN
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less 
rescue anybody.

Chewie barks a reply.

HAN
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets 
delusions of grandeur.

Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.

HAN
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE

Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT 
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a 
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke 
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block 
Luke's path. Luke halts.

Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately 
lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and 
moves on down the hallway.

Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they 
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his 
direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the 
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

LUKE
I must speak with Jabba.

Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and 
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.

LUKE
You will take me to Jabba now!

Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him 
into the gloom.

LUKE
You serve your master well.

Bib responds.

LUKE
And you will be rewarded.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. 
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now 
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a 
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. 
Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.

THREEPIO
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

BIB
Master.

Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.

BIB
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I told you not to admit him.

LUKE
I must be allowed to speak.

BIB	 (in Huttese subtitled)
He must be allowed to speak.

Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

Luke stares hard at Jabba.

LUKE
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

LUKE
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either 
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not 
to underestimate my powers.

Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about 
the pit.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, you're standing on...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.

Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies 
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his 
hand.

JABBA
Bascka!

The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into 
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba 
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained 
by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at 
him and he shakes his head "no."

18   INT RANCOR PIT

Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the 
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically 
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in 
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. 
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! The Rancor!

At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged 
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries 
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.

The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the 
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few 
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers 
and laughs at the guard's fate.

The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just 
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of 
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his 
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the 
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in 
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an 
avalanche.

The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes 
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the 
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility 
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into 
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it 
down on the Rancor's finger.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding 
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he 
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond 
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the 
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The 
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, 
laughing.

Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for 
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. 
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the 
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes 
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on 
an egg.

A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation 
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning 
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh 
commands to his guards and they hurry off.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.

21   INT RANCOR PIT

The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead 
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly 
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel 
and take Luke away.

22   INT THRONE ROOM

The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into 
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.

LUKE
Han!

HAN
Luke!

LUKE
Are you all right?

HAN
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN
How are we doing?

LUKE
The same as always.

HAN
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

Luke looks to Leia.

LEIA
I'm here.

Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia 
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from 
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.

Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed 
that you are to be terminated immediately.

HAN
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of 
Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

HAN	 (to Luke)
Doesn't sound so bad.

THREEPIO
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as 
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

HAN
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

Chewie barks his agreement.

LUKE
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever 
make.

Jabba cackles evilly at this.

As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer 
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but 
Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF

Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by 
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, 
Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is 
Lando in disguise.

HAN
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a 
big light blur.

LUKE
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN
Oh... great!

24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His 
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. 
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to 
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to 
him.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller 
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby 
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?

Artoo beeps a quick reply.

THREEPIO
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. 
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!

Artoo whistles a singsong response.

THREEPIO
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.

25   EXT SARLACC PIT 

The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one 
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's 
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of 
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by 
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is 
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's 
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward 
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps 
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of 
intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across 
loudspeakers.

THREEPIO
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die 
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba 
the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

27   EXT SKIFF

Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.

HAN
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get 
no such pleasure from us. Right?

Chewie growls his agreement.

LUKE
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.

Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look 
of conspiracy to him.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips 
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as 
he speaks into the comlink.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Move him into position.

Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK

Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. 
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the 
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a 
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap 
opens in Artoo's domed head.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Put him in.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK

Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the 
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is 
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his 
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him 
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of 
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He 
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has 
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.

With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded 
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The 
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber 
flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT

A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and 
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him 
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.

32   INT SAIL BARGE

Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the 
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures 
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.

33   EXT SKIFF 

Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of 
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.

LUKE
Easy, Chewie.

At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts 
from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of 
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately 
above the Sarlacc pit.

LANDO
Whoa! Whoa! Help!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket 
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.

35   EXT SKIFF

Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who 
has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, 
the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty 
hunter's gun in half.

Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck 
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the 
rail.

HAN
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.

HAN
I'm okay, pal.

For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a 
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong 
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from 
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight 
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable 
and stands free.

Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is 
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

LANDO
Han! Chewie?

HAN
Lando!

Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets 
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves 
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young 
Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating 
the guards from their midst.

Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, 
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. 
Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold 
of the spear.

Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the 
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his 
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

Chewie barks desperately at Han.

HAN
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?

The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand 
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.

The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts 
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the 
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams 
as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into 
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a 
weak congratulations to Han.

36   INT SAIL BARGE

Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and 
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous 
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the 
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath 
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his 
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms 
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia 
struggles to free herself of her bondage.

37   EXT SKIFF

Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han 
extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously 
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

HAN
Lando, grab it!

LANDO
Lower it!

HAN
I'm trying!

A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han 
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, 
and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot 
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. 
The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit 
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.

HAN
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.

Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han 
extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the 
pit.

HAN
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!

Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck 
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the 
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail 
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up 
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his 
head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks 
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.

The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who 
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron 
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by 
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand 
moves him closer to his final reward.

HAN
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let 
go of the spear.

LANDO
Hold it! Whoa!

Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.

HAN
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.

Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly 
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.

HAN
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

LANDO
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate 
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and 
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.

HAN
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

38   EXT UPPER DECK

The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in 
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: 
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. 
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young 
Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more 
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) 
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK

Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips 
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby 
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.

LEIA
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and 
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out 
one of the golden droid's eyes.

THREEPIO
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!

Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, 
crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye 
dangling from a wire) hurry off.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by 
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke 
turns to face another guard.

LUKE	 (to Leia)
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!

Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels 
the gun around.

LUKE
Point it at the deck!

A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, 
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the 
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He 
flexes the hand; it still works.

Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves 
as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

THREEPIO
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.

Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, 
tumbling toward the sand.

Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she 
has brought around to point down at the deck.

LUKE
Come on!

Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers 
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun 
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.

41   EXT SKIFF  

Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. 
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.

LUKE
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.

LANDO
We're on our way.

The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge 
craft is on fire.

42   EXT SAND DUNE

Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next 
to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff 
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. 
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled 
from the sand.

43   EXT DUNE SEA

The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues 
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the 
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA

A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR 
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, 
pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed 
by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each 
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his 
wound.

Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It 
is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing 
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.

HAN
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA
That's all any of us can see.

HAN	 (blinking)
Then I guess I'm getting better.

As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind 
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. 
Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.

HAN 	(turning to Luke)
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.

LUKE	 (shrugging it off)
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.

HAN
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest 
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide 
awake nothing!

Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, 
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.

LUKE 	(moving to his ship)
I'll see you back at the fleet.

HAN
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

LUKE
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.

HAN		
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's 
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the 
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

LEIA
He means "You're welcome."

LANDO
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE 

The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and 
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and 
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the 
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM 
FALCON.

LUKE
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

LEIA	 (over comlink)
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.

LUKE
I will.

HAN	 (over comlink)
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.

A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of 
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black 
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

LUKE
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a 
promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR

A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in 
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, 
Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward 
the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY

Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous 
Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR

Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth 
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where 
the shuttle is coming to rest.

The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and 
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention 
with a momentous SNAP.

Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a 
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way 
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak 
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's 
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow 
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme 
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.

EMPEROR	 (to Vader)
Rise, my friend.

Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way 
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay 
kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several 
Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the 
procession.

VADER
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

EMPEROR
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue 
your search for young Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, 
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the 
dark side of the
Force.

VADER
As you wish.

EMPEROR
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial 
troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH

Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of 
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps 
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm 
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE

The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of 
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that 
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. 
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

YODA
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?

Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look 
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

LUKE
No... of course not.

YODA	 (tickled, chuckles)
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. 
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?

Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

YODA
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.

Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

LUKE
Master Yoda, you can't die.

YODA
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the 
Force.

LUKE
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

LUKE
Then I am a Jedi?

YODA	 (shakes his head)
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, 
only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.

Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his 
courage. Finally he is able to ask.

LUKE
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile 
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.

YODA
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

LUKE
Yoda, I must know.

YODA
Your father he is.

Luke reacts as if cut.

YODA
Told you, did he?

LUKE
Yes.

A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

YODA
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

YODA		 (gathering all his strength)
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.

LUKE
Well, I'm sorry.

YODA
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, 
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever 
will it dominate your
destiny.

He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

YODA
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, 
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your 
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... 
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green 
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears 
in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING 

Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, 
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to 
help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.

LUKE
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

BEN	 (OS)
Yoda will always be with you.

Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

LUKE
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

LUKE
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be 
Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your 
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a 
certain point of view.

LUKE	 (turning away, derisive)
A certain point of view!

BEN
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend 
greatly on our own
point of view.

Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

BEN
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it 
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened 
to your father was my fault.

Ben pauses sadly.

BEN
Anakin was a good friend.

Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a 
stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.

BEN
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was 
amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to 
train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well 
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the 
galaxy.

Luke is entranced.

LUKE
There's still good in him.

BEN
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be 
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience 
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value 
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you 
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been 
prepared.

LUKE
But I had to help my friends.

BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation)
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved 
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.

LUKE	 (with sadness)
I found out Darth Vader was my father.

BEN
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side 
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest 
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what 
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're 
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, 
you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE
I can't kill my own father.

BEN
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE
But I have no sister.

BEN
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your 
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were 
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the 
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They 
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.

BEN	 (continuing his narrative)
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your 
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep 
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you 
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia 
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.

Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words)
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in 
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew 
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, 
since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family 
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster 
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of 
course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the 
corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a 
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she 
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had 
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became 
desperate.

Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his 
sister.

LUKE
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, 
Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your 
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy 
Vader!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a 
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and 
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the 
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in 
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a 
holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the 
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.

MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern 
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several 
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a 
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he 
finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.

Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.

HAN
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

 LANDO
 Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the 
battle of Taanab.

HAN	 (sarcastic)
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I 
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

LANDO	 (smiling)
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

HAN
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable 
one, remember?

Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.

MON MOTHMA
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has 
come.

This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the 
Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the 
center of the room.

MON MOTHMA
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location 
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon 
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial 
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is 
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that 
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the 
construction of this Death Star.

A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia 
as Chewie barks his amazement.

MON MOTHMA	 (cont)
Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field 
and the Moon of Endor.

ACKBAR
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. 
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does 
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, 
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield 
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield 
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly 
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

There's a concerned murmur.

ACKBAR	 (cont)
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.

HAN
Good luck.

Lando nods his thanks.

HAN
You're gonna need it.

ACKBAR
General Madine.

Madine moves center stage.

GENERAL MADINE
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and 
using a secret
Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the 
shield generator.

The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.

THREEPIO
Sounds dangerous.

LEIA	 (to Han)
I wonder who they found to pull that off.

GENERAL MADINE
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.

HAN
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.

HAN
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.

Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.

HAN	 (smiles)
That's one.

LEIA
Uh, General... count me in.

VOICE	 (OS)
I'm with you, too!

They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more 
cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and 
Leia are surprised and delighted.

Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him 
and looks into his eyes questioningly.

LEIA
 What is it?

LUKE	 (hesitant)
Ask me again sometime.

Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.

HAN
Luke.

LUKE
Hi, Han... Chewie.

Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.

 THREEPIO
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which 
looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. 
Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up 
the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and 
supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.

HAN
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the 
help you can get. She's
the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take 
good care of her.
She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

HAN	 (looks at him warmly)
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.

LANDO
Look, would you get going, you pirate.

Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.

LANDO
Good luck.

HAN
You, too.

Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the 
pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out 
all the Imperial controls.

HAN
You got her warmed?

LUKE
Yeah, she's comin' up.

Chewie growls a complaint.

HAN
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed 
her, Chewie.

Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.

Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on 
something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him 
gently.

LEIA
Hey, are you awake?

HAN
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the 
Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.

LEIA	 (softly)
Come on, General, let's move.

Han snaps back to life.

HAN
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, 
everybody?

LUKE
All set.

THREEPIO
Here we go again.

HAN
All right, hang on.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the 
Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms 
off into space.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at 
the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair 
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death 
Star to the giant green moon of Endor.

Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, 
cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After 
several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.

VADER
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until 
called for.

VADER
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young 
Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go 
out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks 
toward the waiting council members.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON

There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction 
proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star 
Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces 
itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.

59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. 
Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star 
Destroyer can be seen.

HAN
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty 
quick, Chewie.

Chewie growls his agreement.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.

HAN
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

HAN
Transmission commencing.

Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed 
transmission begins.

LEIA
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN
It'll work. It'll work.

Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer 
that looms ever larger before them.

LUKE
Vader's on that ship.

HAN
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep 
your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep 
your distance.

Chewie barks a question.

HAN
I don't know.  Fly casual.

LUKE
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out 
the window.

60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. 
Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment 
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL 
PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen 
earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.

VADER
Where is that shuttle going?

PIETT	 (into comlink)
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

PILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.

VADER
Do they have a code clearance?

PIETT
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.

Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.

PIETT
Shall I hold them?

VADER
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.

PIETT	 (surprised)
As you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
Carry on.

Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.

61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

The group waits tensely.

HAN
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.

present course.

Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks 
worried. Chewie barks.

HAN
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.

63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, 
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a 
steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The 
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio 
bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.

Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly 
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke 
crawl up to take a look.

THREEPIO
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering 
through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked 
nearby.

LEIA
Shall we try and go around?

HAN
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie 
start quietly down.

64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE

The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far 
from the two Imperial scouts.

HAN
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

LUKE
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN	 (grins)
Hey... it's me.

Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. 
Luke and Leia exchange smiles.

Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout 
whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.

SCOUT #1
Go for help! Go!

The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie 
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to 
crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.

LUKE	 (sarcastic)
Great. Come on.

Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol 
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where 
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied 
bike parked nearby.

LEIA
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE
I see them. Wait, Leia!

But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She 
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.

LUKE	 (pointing to the controls)
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!

Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely 
avoiding two huge trees.

HAN
Hey, wait! Ahhh!

He flips the remaining scout to the ground.

65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE

The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia 
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from 
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.

LUKE
Move closer!

Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer 
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, 
slowing the scout.

LUKE
Get alongside that one!

Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their 
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of 
the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him 
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike 
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the 
remaining scout.

LUKE
Get him!

The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing 
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser 
cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a 
glancing hit.

LUKE	 (indicating the one ahead)
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into 
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as 
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and 
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a 
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted 
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.

The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into 
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.

FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom 
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and 
rises out of sight.

The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia 
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes 
a glancing hit.

Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches 
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has 
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike 
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. 
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a 
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a 
conflagration.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue 
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The 
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a 
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top 
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a 
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside 
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all 
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able 
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the 
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are 
moving as one.

Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and 
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's 
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find 
Luke.

Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and 
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and 
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it 
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, 
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty 
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, 
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait 
anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed 
head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

THREEPIO
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's 
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.

HAN
Luke! Where's Leia?

LUKE	 (concerned)
What? She didn't come back?

HAN
I thought she was with you.

LUKE
We got separated.

Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.

LUKE
Hey, we better go look for her.

Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.

HAN
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the 
squad proceeds in another.

THREEPIO
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.

They move off into the woods.

THREEPIO	 (to Artoo)
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into 
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat 
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this 
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up 
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where 
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and 
disheveled.

The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a 
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins 
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.

LEIA
Cut it out!

She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.

LEIA
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of 
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.

LEIA
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here 
is.

She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from 
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log 
beside her.

LEIA
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.

Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia 
pats the log again.

LEIA
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.

LEIA
All right. You want something to eat?

She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. 
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously 
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.

LEIA
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?

Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the 
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps 
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her 
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.

LEIA
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery 
little thing, aren't you?

Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming 
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to 
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning 
to Leia.

LEIA
What is it?

Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log 
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding 
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears 
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the 
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL 
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches 
out his hand for her weapon.

SCOUT #l
Freeze!  Come on, get up!

She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage 
in front of the log.

SCOUT #1
Go get your ride and take her back to base.

SCOUT #2
Yes, sir.

The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the 
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout 
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. 
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, 
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and 
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's 
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once 
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards 
Leia withÊnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking 
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the 
dense foliage.

LEIA
Come on, let's get outta here.

As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and 
tugs at Leia to follow him.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER

Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private 
elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.

GUARD
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.

VADER        
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the 
Force)
The Emperor will see me, now!

GUARD
(repeating Vader's command)
The Emperor will see you, now.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens 
to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It 
appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He 
waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark 
Lord.

EMPEROR
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

EMPEROR	 (no surprise)
Yes, I know.

VADER	 (after a beat)
My son is with them.

EMPEROR	 (very cool)
Are you sure?

VADER
I have felt him, my Master.

EMPEROR
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are 
clear, Lord
Vader.

Vader knows what is being asked.

VADER
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

VADER	 (skeptical)
He will come to me?

EMPEROR
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will 
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.

VADER	 (bows)
As you wish.

The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move 
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. 
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.

HAN	 (OS)
Luke! Luke!

Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage 
of a speeder bike in the grass.

THREEPIO
Oh, Master Luke.

LUKE
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.

He tosses the helmet to Han.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.

HAN	 (gravely)
I hope she's alright.

Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off 
through the foliage.

                              HAN
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, 
Artoo whistles nervously.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE

The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a 
tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from 
it.

HAN
Hey, I don't get it.

The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.

HAN	 (cont)
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.

LUKE
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. 
SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, 
suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of 
beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a 
jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.

HAN
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this 
thing. 
(trying to free an arm) 
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN
Yeah, sure.

Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting 
appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an 
arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to 
spin.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-
op!!

Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, 
crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they 
realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long 
spear.

HAN
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.

Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok 
warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. 
He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.

HAN
Hey!

LUKE
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets 
them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.

LUKE
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free 
of the net and sits up, rattled.

THREEPIO
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!

When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among 
themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok 
nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In 
a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled 
bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks 
begin to chant at Threepio.

LUKE
Do you understand anything they're saying?

THREEPIO
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million 
forms of
communication.

HAN
What are you telling them?

THREEPIO
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive 
dialect.  But
I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange 
"what next?" looks.

HAN
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN
Proper?!

THREEPIO
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.

HAN
Why, you--

Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their 
god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a 
menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands 
placatingly.

HAN
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their 
prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and 
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the 
captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the 
remaining creatures.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST

The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the 
giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into 
nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts 
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes 
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other 
Ewoks follow suit.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE

The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks 
gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the 
newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.

Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is 
placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others 
are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently 
placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and 
Chewie are less than fascinated.

HAN
I have a really bad feeling about this.

Chewie growls his concern.

Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes 
out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join 
Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A 
larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber 
with great curiosity.

Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing 
to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit 
under Han with firewood.

HAN
What did he say?

THREEPIO
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the 
main course at a
banquet in my honor.

The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. 
Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening 
at the same moment the prisoners see her.

HAN and LUKE
Leia!

As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.

LEIA
Oh!

THREEPIO
Your Royal Highness.

Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the 
assembled Ewoks and sighs.

LEIA
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.

Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads 
negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks 
some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue 
with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .

HAN
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry 
and use your magic.

THREEPIO
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --

LUKE
Just tell them.

Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps 
forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to 
concentrate.

THREEPIO
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...

Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the 
ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.

THREEPIO
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! 
Oh!

The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio 
begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio 
calling out in total panic at his situation.

THREEPIO
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! 
Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!

Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and 
release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group 
embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at 
him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. 
Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. 
When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo 
beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, 
finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The 
Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group 
of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and 
marveling at his height.

THREEPIO
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.

LUKE
Thanks, Threepio.

THREEPIO	 (still shaken)
I...I never knew I had it in me.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS

A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, 
creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a 
group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. 
The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the 
two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.

Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's 
squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally 
murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the 
Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, 
mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. 
Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable 
in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.

THREEPIO
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han 
Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.

At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in 
agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.

The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer 
and screeches.

HAN
What's going on?

LEIA
I don't know.

Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something 
passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not 
notice.

THREEPIO
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.

HAN
Just what I always wanted.

Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket 
clings to Han's leg.

HAN	 (chuckles)
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. 
(to Wicket) 
Thank you. Okay.

THREEPIO
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield 
generator.

Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders 
outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

HAN
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try 
and get our weapons back.

Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.

HAN	 (cont)
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT

The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and 
flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft 
night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands 
staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.

LEIA
Luke, what's wrong?

Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

LUKE
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE
What do you remember?

LEIA
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE
Tell me.

LEIA
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
Why are you asking me all this?

He looks away.

LUKE
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LEIA	 (alarmed)
How do you know?

LUKE
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. 
That's why I have to go.
(facing her)
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
I have to face him.

Leia is distraught, confused.

LEIA
Why?

Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

LUKE
He's my father.

LEIA
Your father?

LUKE
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I 
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.

LEIA
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and 
could never have.

LUKE
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to 
use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has 
it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she 
doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.

LUKE
Yes. It's you Leia.

LEIA
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave 
this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to 
the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I 
have to try.

They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.

Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He 
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed 
in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and 
comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only 
now that she is crying.

HAN
Hey, what's goin' on?

Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

LEIA
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.

HAN	 (angry)
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

LEIA
I...I can't tell you.

HAN	 (loses his temper)
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

LEIA
I...

HAN
Ahhh...

He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.

HAN
I'm sorry.

LEIA
Hold me.

Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands 
gracefully on the huge platform.

Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of 
the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks 
particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK

Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into 
an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward 
another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, 
in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with 
complete calm.

COMMANDER
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I 
believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct 
a further search of the area.

The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

COMMANDER
He was armed only with this.

Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the 
lightsaber from the commander's hand.

VADER
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his 
companions to me.

COMMANDER
Yes, my Lord.

The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone 
in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest 
filter in upon them.

VADER
The Emperor has been expecting you.

LUKE
I know, father.

VADER
So, you have accepted the truth.

LURE
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

VADER	 (turning to face him)
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

LUKE
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there 
is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is 
why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your 
Emperor now.

Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved 
hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.

VADER	 (indicating lightsaber)
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, 
brilliant blade.

VADER
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has 
foreseen.

They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.

LUKE
Come with me.

VADER
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.

VADER
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

LUKE
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER
If that is your destiny.

LUKE
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict 
within you. Let go
of your hate.

VADER
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature 
of the Force. He is
your master now.

Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring 
at one another for a long moment.

LUKE
Then my father is truly dead.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR

Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 
PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield 
generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing 
platform. Leia studies the installation.

LEIA
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that 
landing platform. This
isn't gonna be easy.

HAN
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily 
guarded than this.

Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to 
Threepio.

LEIA
What's he saying?

THREEPIO
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star 
Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a 
spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some 
getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando 
speaks into his comlink.

LANDO
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

ACKBAR 	(VO)
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

Lando turns to his weird copilot.

LANDO
Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down 
on time...
(to himself) 
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

ACKBAR	 (VO)
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

LANDO
All right. Stand by.

He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

We are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then 
Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS 
INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and 
Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is 
spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that 
leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes 
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an 
observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.

HAN
Back door, huh? Good idea.

Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.

HAN	 (cont)
It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.

LEIA
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

HAN	 (with self-confident grin)
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks 
chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers 
into the underbrush.

Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.

THREEPIO
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

LEIA
Quiet.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA
Oh, no.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE

Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial 
scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto 
one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at 
random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. 
Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in 
surprise.

85   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.

HAN 	(sighs)
There goes our surprise attack.

86   EXT BUNKER

The Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into 
motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.

SCOUT
Look! Over there! Stop him!

Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away 
in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.

87   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.

HAN
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. 
We'll take care of this.

Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. 
Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.

THREEPIO
I have decided that we shall stay here.

88   EXT FOREST

Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, 
but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him 
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds 
a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the 
trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the 
still-flying, unoccupied bike.

89   EXT BUNKER

Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the 
shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms 
of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps 
out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out 
of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No 
sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout 
behind.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk 
across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side 
by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.

EMPEROR
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.

Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down 
at Luke's binders.

EMPEROR
You no longer need those.

The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders 
fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, 
free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.

EMPEROR
Guards, leave us.

The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.

EMPEROR	 (to Luke)
I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call 
me Master.

LUKE
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.

The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. 
The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can 
perceive the evil visage within the hood.

EMPEROR
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are 
mistaken...about a great many things.

VADER
His lightsaber.

Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's 
lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.

EMPEROR
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know 
your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with 
you.

LUKE
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

The Emperor laughs.

EMPEROR
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.

Luke looks up sharply.

EMPEROR
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.

Vader looks at Luke.

LUKE
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

EMPEROR
Your faith in your friends is yours.

VADER
It is pointless to resist, my son.

The Emperor turns to face Luke.

EMPEROR	 (angry)
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. 
(indicates Endor)
Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...

Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.

EMPEROR	 (cont)
...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who 
allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It 
is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my 
best troops awaits them.

Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword 
in the Emperor's hand.

EMPEROR
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when 
your friends arrive.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and 
enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.

HAN
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.

The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. 
Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

LEIA
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN
Charges!  Come on, come on!

Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more 
controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at 
the door.

THREEPIO	 (to Wicket)
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into 
the forest.

THREEPIO
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.

Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial 
commander enters.

COMMANDER
Freeze! You Rebel scum.

Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them 
and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. 
Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. 
Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET

The Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the 
Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The 
Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the 
space armada bears down on its target.

93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.

LANDO
All wings report in.

WEDGE
Red Leader standing by.

GRAY LEADER
Gray Leader standing by.

GREEN LEADER
Green Leader standing by.

WEDGE
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar 
watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.

ACKBAR
May the Force be with us.

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to 
the control panel and talks to Lando.

LANDO
We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up 
or down. Well, how
could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.

Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the 
implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his 
comlink.

LANDO
Break off the attack! The shield is still up.

RED LEADER	 (VO)
I get no reading. Are you sure?

LANDO
Pull up! All craft pull up!

The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the 
Death Star move off right.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD

The Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid 
the unseen wall.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes 
course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the 
armada tries to halt its forward momentum.

ACKBAR
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to 
Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.

CONTROLLER
Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive 
Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.

ACKBAR
It's a trap!

LANDO	 (over comlink)
Fighters coming in.

There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.

The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an 
armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in 
and around the giant Rebel cruisers.

REBEL PILOT
There's too many of them!

LANDO
Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader.

The battle continues around the giant cruisers.

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

Through the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the 
distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

EMPEROR
Come, boy. See for yourself.

The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. 
Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

EMPEROR
From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and 
the end of your insignificant Rebellion.

Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest 
of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the 
lightsaber.

EMPEROR
You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your 
Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to 
your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my 
servant.

Vader watches Luke in his agony.

LUKE
No!

EMPEROR
It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now 
mine!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the 
bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now 
crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial 
troops. The situation looks hopeless.

STORMTROOPER
All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!

From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps 
and whistles. 
And --

THREEPIO
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?

BUNKER COMMANDER
Bring those two down here!

STORMTROOPER
Let's go!

Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six 
Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids 
duck out of sight behind the tree.

THREEPIO
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?

STORMTROOPER
Freeze! Don't move!

THREEPIO
We surrender.

The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting 
quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a 
band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.

THREEPIO
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.

In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK 
ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their 
fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and 
their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting 
Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the 
trees above.

In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for 
the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes 
to the bunker door control panel.

LEIA
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN
Here's the terminal.

LEIA	 (into comlink)
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.

Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround 
them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of 
whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, 
runs after him.

THREEPIO
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? 
No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the 
little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.

A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They 
fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns 
and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks 
abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker 
moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge 
logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.

A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's 
foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged 
behind.

Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts 
round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between 
two trees.

100  EXT SPACE

The Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat 
with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the 
Rebel armada.

101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
Lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel 
squads.

LANDO
Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

WEDGE
Red Three, Red Two, pull in!

RED TWO
Got it!

RED THREE
Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

WEDGE
Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical 
frigate.

Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at 
the TIEs from the belly guns.

NAVIGATOR
Pressure's steady.

The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.

LANDO
Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers 
are waiting for.

102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET  

The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the 
battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of 
the fleet.

103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge 
window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.

COMMANDER
We're in attack position now, sir.

PIETT
Hold here.

COMMANDER
We're not going to attack?

PIETT
I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special 
planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

The Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle 
fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship 
explodes against the protective shield.

EMPEROR
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now 
witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle 
station.
(into comlink)
Fire at will, Commander.

Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the 
Rebel fleet beyond.

105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands 
over them.

JERJERROD
Fire!

106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

A button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded 
Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of 
light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side 
at a control panel.

107  EXT DEATH STAR

The giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to 
glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.

108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings 
dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is 
hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.

The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE 
fighters.

109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. 
Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star 
firepower.

LANDO
That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! 
(into comlink)
Home One, this is Gold Leader.

110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the 
comlink.

ACKBAR
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel 
firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Artoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover 
fire.

THREEPIO
We're coming!

HAN
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A 
large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally 
landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and 
smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn 
around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his 
appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in 
his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded 
companion.

THREEPIO
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

HAN
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

LEIA
I'll cover you.

Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the 
stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the 
wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting 
laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are 
struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then 
realizes that he is dead.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR

The Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death 
Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star 
Destroyers.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating 
giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.

LANDO	 (desperately)
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star 
Destroyers at point-
blank range.

ACKBAR
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might 
just take a few of
them with us.

The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and 
begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the 
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.

The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.

REBEL PILOT
She's gonna blow!

Y-WING PILOT
I'm hit!

The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into 
the control tower, exploding.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being 
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there 
is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.

EMPEROR
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not 
survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will 
die...as will your friends.

Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.

EMPEROR
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! 
Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark 
side will be complete.

Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He 
ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber 
flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the 
Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his 
father.

115  EXT FOREST

The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated 
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the 
Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.

A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An 
Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The 
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until 
it finally topples over with a great crash.

A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end 
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks 
cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, 
then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.

WALKER PILOT #1
Look!

PILOT #2
Get him off of there!

The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked 
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into 
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are 
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, 
Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch 
with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to 
listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.

Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at 
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The 
Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the 
battle in their favor.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to 
hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some 
stormtroopers.

HAN
I think I got it. I got it!

The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a 
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with 
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her 
shoulder hit by a laser blast.

THREEPIO
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN
Let's see.

LEIA
It's not bad.

STORMTROOPER	 (OS)
Freeze!

They freeze.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move!

Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two 
stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment 
seems suspended in time.

HAN
I love you.

Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.

LEIA
I know.

STORMTROOPER
Hands up! Stand up!

Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She 
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward 
Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, 
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

HAN	 (to Leia)
Stay back.

The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and 
barks triumphantly.

HAN
Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even 
more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown 
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is 
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke 
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.

EMPEROR (laughing)
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through 
you.

Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and 
realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his 
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

LUKE
I will not fight you, father.

Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.

VADER
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in 
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader 
stands below him.

LUKE
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the 
conflict.

VADER
There is no conflict.

LUKE
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe 
you'll destroy me
now.

VADER
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, 
then you will meet
your destiny.

Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding 
the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground 
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's 
platform. Vader moves to find him.

EMPEROR	 (laughs)
Good.  Good.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each 
other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer 
explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a 
series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next 
to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the 
Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack 
one of the larger Imperial ships.

LANDO
Watch out. Squad at .06.

REBEL PILOT
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

WEDGE
Good shot, Red Two.

LANDO
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an 
Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and 
interference.

HAN/PILOT	 (VO)
It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into 
the woods. We
need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

The controllers cheer.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
Send three squads to help. Open the back door.

SECOND COMMANDER
Yes, sir.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, 
they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their 
weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the 
roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns
as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant 
explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.

HAN
Throw me another charge.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, 
searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.

VADER
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

LUKE
I will not fight you.

VADER
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your 
friends. Yes, your
thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially 
for...

Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in 
anguish.

VADER
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed 
her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will 
not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will.

LUKE
Never-r-r!

Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather 
with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader 
fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of 
the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. 
Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.

The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to 
block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the 
wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical 
stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves 
over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. 
The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.

EMPEROR
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and 
take your father's
place at my side!

Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, 
black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his 
father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in 
preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.

LUKE
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 
I am a Jedi,
like my father before me.

The Emperor's glee turns to rage.

EMPEROR
So be it...Jedi.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across 
the clearing.

HAN
Move! Move!

A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a 
spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes 
along with the bunker.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.

ACKBAR
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. 
(laughs)
Told you they'd do it!

The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward 
the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The 
Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.

EMPEROR
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.

Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's 
hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the 
Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a 
moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the 
young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader 
struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.

EMPEROR
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.

Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the 
Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into 
the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.

EMPEROR
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You 
have paid the price for
your lack of vision.

Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward 
where Vader stands watching.

LUKE	 (groans)
Father, please. Help me.

Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, 
then back to Luke on the floor.

EMPEROR
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts 
from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound 
screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.

Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed 
figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. 
The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now 
lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to 
strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his 
helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high 
over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of 
the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, 
Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls 
into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it 
explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is 
whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the 
bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away 
from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant 
warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star 
to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of 
the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.

WEDGE
I'm going in.

LANDO
Here goes nothing.

Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed 
by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who 
continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as 
they race through the dark shaft.

LANDO
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power 
generator.

WEDGE
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by 
the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.

LANDO
Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of 
those TIE fighters to
follow you.

PILOT
Copy, Gold Leader.

The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and 
Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon 
scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast 
away at them.

LANDO
That was too close.

Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages 
on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ACKBAR
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on 
that Super Star Destroyer.

X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the 
battle. They look concerned.

CONTROLLER
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

PIETT
Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.

The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel 
fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

PIETT
Intensify forward firepower!

COMMANDER
It's too late!

The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a 
huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the 
Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. 
They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as 
the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading 
a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and 
desperate to escape.

In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous 
deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. 
Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as 
Vader draws him closer.

VADER	 (a whisper)
Luke, help me take this mask off.

LURE
But you'll die.

VADER
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my 
own eyes.

Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There 
beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the 
dying man smiles at the sight before him.

ANAKIN	 (very weak)
Now...go, my son. Leave me.

LUKE
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save 
you.

ANAKIN
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you 
were right.

LUKE
Father...I won't leave you.

Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half 
carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a 
shuttle.

131  EXT DEATH STAR

The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense 
superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers 
outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is 
answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station 
itself.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS

Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing 
Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor 
shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.

WEDGE
There it is!

LANDO
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several 
proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small 
explosions.

The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously 
close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a 
powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.

He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of 
the continuing chain of explosions.

133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, 
watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing 
room.

ACKBAR
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

134  EXT DEATH STAR

An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the 
main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown 
away.

Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando 
expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and 
whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star 
supernovas into oblivion.

135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.

136  EXT ENDOR FOREST

Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all 
look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of 
self-destruction. They all cheer.

THREEPIO
They did it!

Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. 
Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent 
voice.

HAN
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

LEIA
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN
You love him, don't you?

Leia smiles, puzzled.

LEIA
Yes.

HAN
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the 
way.

She realizes his misunderstanding.

LEIA
Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.

Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.

137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT

Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his 
father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, 
watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader -- 
Anakin Skywalker.

In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the 
forest.

138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

A huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and 
Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, 
dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and 
liberation.

Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then, 
finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. 
They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's 
touch, together to the end.

Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original 
group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems 
distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at 
the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling 
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the 
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han, 
		old buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Well, I finished my circle.  I 
		don't pick up any life readings.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		There isn't enough life on this 
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.  
		The sensors are placed, I'm going 
		back.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Right.  I'll see you shortly.  
		There's a meteorite that hit the 
		ground near here.  I want to check 
		it out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

				LUKE
		Hey, steady girl.  What's the 
		matter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over 
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

				LUKE
		Aaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which 
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various 
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his 
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie 
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss.

				HAN
		Chewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

				HAN
		All right, don't lose your temper.
		I'll come right back and give you 
		a hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han 
leaves.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, 
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and 
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

				RIEEKAN
		Solo?

				HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll 
know if anything comes around.

				RIEEKAN
		Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

				HAN
		No.  He's checking out a meteorite 
		that hit near him.

				RIEEKAN
			(indicates radar 
			 screen)
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system, it's going to be difficult 
		to spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

				HAN
		General, I've got to leave.  I 
		can't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed.

				RIEEKAN
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				HAN
		Well, there's a price on my head.
		If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, 
		I'm a dead man.

				RIEEKAN
		A death mark's not an easy thing 
		to live with.  You're a good
		fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

				HAN
		Thank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

				HAN
			(with feeling)
		Well, Your Highness, I guess this 
		is it.

				LEIA
		That's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

				HAN
			(cooly)
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		Han!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

				HAN
		Yes, Your Highnessness?

				LEIA
		I thought you decided to stay.

				HAN
		Well, the bounty hunter we ran 
		into on Ord Mantell changed my
		mind.  

				LEIA
		Han, we need you!

				HAN
		We?

				LEIA
		Yes.

				HAN
		Oh, what about you need?

				LEIA
			(mystified)
		I need?  I don't know what you're 
		talking about.

				HAN
			(shakes his head, 
			 fed up) 
		You probably don't.

				LEIA
		And what precisely am I supposed 
		to know?

				HAN
		Come on!  You want me to stay 
		because of the way you feel about
		me.

				LEIA
		Yes.  You're a great help to us.
		You're a natural leader...

				HAN
		No!  That's not it.  Come on.  
		Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

				LEIA
You're imagining things.

				HAN
		Am I?  Then why are you following 
		me?  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss?

				LEIA
		I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

				HAN
		I can arrange that.  You could use 
		a good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an 
ice wall toward the main hangar.

				THREEPIO
		Don't try to blame me.  I didn't 
		ask you to turn on the thermal 
		heater.  I merely commented that it 
		was freezing in the princess' 
		chamber.  But it's supposed to be 
		freezing.  How are we going to dry 
		out all her clothes?  I really don't 
		know.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, switch off.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are 
struggling with their central lifters.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Why do you take this apart now? 
		I'm trying to get us out of here 
		and you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Put them back together right now.

				THREEPIO
		Might I have a word with you, 
		please?

				HAN
		What do you want?

				THREEPIO
		Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
		She's been trying to get you on 
		the communicator.

				HAN
		I turned it off.  I don't want to 
		talk to her.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering 
		about Master Luke.  He hasn't come 
		back yet.  She doesn't know where he 
		is.

				HAN
		I don't know where he is.

				THREEPIO
		Nobody knows where he is.

				HAN
		What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as 
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

				THREEPIO
		Well, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

				HAN
		Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer 
approaches.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir?

				HAN
		Do you know where Commander 
		Skywalker is?

				DECK OFFICER
		I haven't seen him.  It's possible 
		he came in through the south entrance.

				HAN
		It's possible?  Why don't you go 
		find out?  It's getting dark out there.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's 
mouth.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire 
		what's going on?

				HAN
		Why not?

				THREEPIO
		Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, 
		let's find Princess Leia.  Between 
		ourselves, I think Master Luke is 
		in considerable danger.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the 
tunnel.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't 
		come in through the south entrance.
		He might have forgotten to check in.

				HAN
		Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

				DECK OFFICER
		Not yet.  We're having some trouble 
		adapting them to the cold.

				HAN
		Then we'll have to go out on 
		Tauntauns.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, the temperature's dropping too 
		rapidly.

				HAN
		That's right.  And my friends out 
		in it.

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		I'll cover sector twelve.  Have 
		com-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

				DECK OFFICER
		Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you 
		reach the first marker.

				HAN
		Then I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter 
night.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens 
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the 
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, 
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about 
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he 
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into 
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts 
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The 
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke 
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams 
in pain.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak 
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile 
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up 
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves 
stiffly over to him.

				THREEPIO
		You must come along now, Artoo.  
		There's really nothing more we can 
		do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

				THREEPIO
		Don't say thing like that!  Of 
		course we'll see Master Luke again.
		He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
			(to himself)
		Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll 
		be quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully 
keeps his vigil.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, 
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, 
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple 
of feet and then collapses.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, 
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold 
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the 
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.  

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with 
the princess.

				LIEUTENANT
		Sir, all the patrols are in.
		There's still no contact from 
		Skywalker or Solo.

				THREEPIO
		Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been 
		quite unable to pick up any signals, 
		although he does admit that his own 
		range is far too weak to abandon 
		all hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

				DERLIN
		Your Highness, there's nothing 
		more we can do tonight.  The shield 
		doors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

				DERLIN
		Close the doors.

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, 
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex 
series of efficient beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo says the chances of survival 
		are seven hundred seventy-five...
		to one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the 
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge 
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

				THREEPIO
		Actually, Artoo has been known to 
		make mistakes... from time to time.
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry 
		about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll 
		be all right.  He's quite clever, 
		you know... for a human being.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks 
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is 
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

				BEN
		Luke... Luke.

				LUKE
			(weakly)
		Ben?

				BEN
		You will go to the Dagobah system.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system?

				BEN
		There you will learn from Yoda, 
		the Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching 
from the windswept horizon.

				LUKE
			(groaning faintly)
		Ben... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered 
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, 
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him 
urgently.

				HAN
		Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.  
		Come on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping 
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a 
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun 
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the 
Tauntaun expires.

				HAN 
		Not much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben... Ben...

				HAN
		Hang on, kid.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He 
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's 
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

				HAN
			(reeling from the 
			 odor) 
		Whew...

				LUKE
		Dagobah...

				HAN
		This may smell bad, kid...

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Yoda...

				HAN
		...but it will keep you warm... 
		til I get the shelter built.
			(struggling to get 
			 Luke inside the 
			 carcass) 
		Ooh... I thought they smelled bad 
		on the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han 
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter 
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection 
against a bitter Hoth night.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN

Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He 
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep 
from one of his monitors.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter) 
		Echo Base... I've got something!  Not 
		much, but it could be a life form.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT

The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new 
direction.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter)
		This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue 
		Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?  
		Commander Skywalker, do you copy? 
		This is Rogue Two.

There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

				HAN
			(filtered over 
			 Zev's receiver)
		Good morning.  Nice of you guys 
		to drop by.

				ZEV
			(switching transmitters) 
		Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I 
		found them.  Repeat, I found them.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY

The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.  
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots 
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his 
arms frantically at the tiny craft.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch 
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank 
filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, 
raving in delirium.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM

Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows 
terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the 
room.

				THREEPIO
		Master Luke, sir, it's so good 
		to see you fully functional again.

Artoo beeps his good wishes.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo expresses his relief, also.

Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.

				HAN
		How are you feeling, kid?  You 
		don't look so bad to me.  In 
		fact, you look strong enough to 
		pull the ears off a Gundark.

				LUKE
		Thanks to you.

				HAN
		That's two you owe me, junior.

Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, 
devilish grin.

				HAN
		Well your Worship, looks like 
		you managed to keep me around for
		a little while longer.

				LEIA
			(haughtily)
		I had nothing to do with it.  General 
		Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for 
		any ships to leave the system until 
		we've activated the energy shield.

				HAN
		That's a good story.  I think you 
		just can't bear to let a gorgeous 
		guy like me out of your sight.

				LEIA
		I don't know where you get your 
		delusions, laser brain.

Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, 
regards Chewie good-humoredly.

				HAN
		Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you 
		didn't see us alone in the south 
		passage.

Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

				HAN
		She expressed her true feelings 
		for me.

Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

				LEIA
		My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
		witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
		herder!

				HAN
		Who's scruffy-looking? 
			(to Luke) 
		I must have hit pretty close to 
		the mark to get her all riled up 
		like that, huh, kid?

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she 
focuses on Luke.

				LEIA
		Why, I guess you don't know 
		everything about women yet?

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns 
on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly 
dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head 
and grins.

Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		Headquarters personnel, report to 
		command center.

The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry 
out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

				HAN
		Take it easy.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse us, please.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia 
and Han.

				RIEEKAN
		Princess... we have a visitor.

The group hurries over to Rieekan.

				RIEEKAN
		We've picked up something outside 
		the base in zone twelve, moving 
		east.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		It's metal.

				LEIA
		Then it couldn't be one of those 
		creatures that attacked Luke.

				HAN
		It could be a speeder, one of ours.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		No.  Wait - there's something very 
		weak coming through.

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the 
strange signal.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I am fluent in six million 
		forms of communication.  This signal 
		is not used by the Alliance.  It 
		could be an Imperial code.

The transmission ends in static.

				HAN
		It isn't friendly, whatever it is.  
		Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

				RIEEKAN
		Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to 
		station three-eight.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large 
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing 
signal.

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has 
popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings 
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot 
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million 
pieces.

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the 
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Afraid there's not much left.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		What was it?

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit 
		it that hard.  It must have had a 
		self-destruct.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		An Imperial probe droid.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		It's a good bet the Empire knows 
		we're here.

				RIEEKAN
		We'd better start the evacuation.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five 
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of 
space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller 
spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro.

INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK

Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear 
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The 
squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built 
General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the 
approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the 
Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge, 
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.

				PIETT
		Admiral.

				OZZEL
		Yes, Captain

				PIETT
		I think we've got something, sir.  
		The report is only a fragment from 
		a probe droid in the Hoth system, 
		but it's the best lead we've had.

				OZZEL
			(irritated) 
		We have thousands of probe droids 
		searching the galaxy.  I want proof, 
		not leads!

				PIETT
		The visuals indicate life readings.

				OZZEL
		It could mean anything.  If we 
		followed every lead...

				PIETT
		But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed 
		to be devoid of human forms.

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.  
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.

				VADER
		You found something?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
			(studying the image 
			 on the console screen) 
		That's it.  The Rebels are there.

				OZZEL
		My lord, there are so many uncharted 
		settlements.  It could be smugglers, 
		it could be...

				VADER
		That is the system.  And I'm sure 
		Skywalker is with them.  Set your 
		course for the Hoth system.  General 
		Veers, prepare you men.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY

A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the 
main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being 
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in 
panic.

				REBEL CAPTAIN
		Groups seven and ten will stay 
		behind to fly the speeders.  As 
		soon as each transport is loaded, 
		evacuation control will give 
		clearance for immediate launch.

				REBEL FIGHTER
		Right, sir.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert 
stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near 
the main entrance.

In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the 
lifters of the Millennium Falcon.

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out 
his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.

				HAN
			(into comlink, to 
			 Chewie)
		Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off! 
		Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han 
surveys the new damage.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical 
droid stands by.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Sir, it will take quite a while 
		to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

				LUKE
		Well, forget the heavy equipment.
		There's plenty of time to get the 
		smaller modules on the transports.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Take care, sir.

				LUKE
		Thanks.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his 
heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He 
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are 
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.

				LUKE
		Chewie, take care of yourself, 
		okay?

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and 
gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair 
droid when he sees Luke.

				HAN
		Hi, kid.
			(to droid)
		There's got to be a reason for 
		it.  Check it at the other end.
		Wait a second.
			(to Luke)
		You all right?

				LUKE
		Yeah.

				HAN
		Be careful.

				LUKE
		You, too.

Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps, 
he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent 
communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, 
all difficult to verbalize.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.

Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a 
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer 
scan.

				CONTROLLER
		General, there's a fleet of Star 
		Destroyers coming out of hyperspace 
		in sector four.

				RIEEKAN
		Reroute all power to the energy 
		shield.  We've got to hold them till 
		all transports are away.  Prepare 
		for ground assault.

Rieekan exits hurriedly.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE

The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls 
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.  
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving 
Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not 
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general 
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.

				VADER
		What is it, General?

				VEERS
		My lord, the fleet has moves out 
		of light-speed.  Com-Scan has 
		detected an energy field protecting 
		an area around the sixth planet of 
		the Hoth system.  The field is 
		strong enough to deflect any 
		bombardment.

				VADER
			(angrily)
		The Rebels are alerted to our 
		presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out 
		of light-speed too close to the 
		system.

				VEERS
		He felt surprise was wiser...

				VADER
		He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
		General, prepare your troops for a 
		surface attack.

				VEERS
		Yes, my lord.

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen 
showing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the 
viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.

				OZZEL
		Lord Vader, the fleet has moved 
		out of light-speed, and we're 
		preparing to... Aaagh!

				VADER
		You have failed me for the last 
		time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, 
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond 
the energy shield and deploy the 
fleet so that nothing gets off that 
system.  You are in command now, 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
		Thank you, Lord Vader.

Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed 
emotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a 
final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered 
in the center of the hangar.

				LEIA
		All troop carriers will assemble 
		at the north entrance.  The heavy 
		transport ships will leave as 
		soon as they're loaded.  Only two 
		fighter escorts per ship.  The 
		energy shield can only be opened 
		for a short time, so you'll have 
		to stay very close to your transports.

				HOBBIE
		Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

				LEIA
		The ion cannon will fire several 
		shots to make sure that any enemy 
		ships will be out of your flight 
		path.  When you've gotten past the 
		energy shield, proceed directly to 
		the rendezvous point.  Understood?

				PILOTS
			(in unison)
		Right.  Okay.

				LEIA
		Good luck.

				DERLIN
		Okay.  Everyone to your stations.  
		Let's go!

The pilots hurry away.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH - DAY

Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along 
the snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled 
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold 
wind.

Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into 
position.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - POWER GENERATORS

Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy 
battle equipment.  Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking 
fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and 
General Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear.

				RIEEKAN
		Their primary target will be the 
		power generators.  Prepare to 
		open the shield.

EXT. ICE PLAIN

The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from 
the ice planet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above 
the white surface of the planet Hoth.

INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

An Imperial controller approaches his commander.

				CONTROLLER
		Sir, Rebel ships are coming into 
		our sector.

				CAPTAIN
		Good.  Our first catch of the day.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

				WOMAN CONTROLLER
		Stand by, ion control... Fire!

EXT. REBEL BASE ICE CAVE - ION CANNON

The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two 
red energy beams skyward.

EXT. SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT

The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, 
closely followed by the two red energy beams.

As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star 
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.  The 
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful 
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.

The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the 
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away 
to safety.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their 
vehicles.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		The first transport is away.

Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.  
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner, 
Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.

				DACK
		Feeling all right, sir?

				LUKE
		Just like new, Dack.  How about 
		you?

				DACK
		Right now I feel like I could take 
		on the whole Empire myself.

				LUKE
			(quietly, strapping 
			 in)
		I know what you mean.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN

A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size 
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the 
Rebel base.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through 
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He 
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the 
ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the 
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.

The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding 
begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is 
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks 
into his comlink.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

INT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR

Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow 
begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding 
Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.

				TRENCH OFFICER
			(over comlink) 
		We have spotted Imperial walkers!

				CONTROLLER
Imperial walkers on the north 
ridge.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt 
all around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons 
tightens from the cold and from fear.

Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Echo station Five-Seven.  We're 
		on our way.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.  
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		All right, boys, keep tight now.

				DACK
		Luke, I have no approach vector.  
		I'm not set.

				LUKE
		Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern 
		delta.  Go now!

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other 
walkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the 
enormous walkers and bank to the right.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		All right, I'm coming in.

He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying 
toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks 
between the legs.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Hobbie, you still with me?

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly 
past it.

Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOWTRENCH

Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice 
explode all around them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other 
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other 
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.

A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and 
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing 
Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine 
forward.

Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads 
straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker 
window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over 
the impregnable war machine.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.

				LUKE
		That armor's too strong for 
		blasters.

On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window, 
twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Rogue Group, use your harpoons 
		and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
		It might be our only chance of 
		stopping them.
			(to Dack)
		All right, stand by, Dack.

Dack is at the gunner's controls.

				DACK
		Luke, we've got a malfunction in 
		fire control.  I'll have to cut in 
		the auxiliary.

				LUKE
		Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get 
		ready to fire that tow cable.

Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up 
his harpoon gun.

Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.  
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course 
for the tiny craft.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the 
walker as explosions burst all around them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if 
Dack is all right.

				LUKE
		Dack?  Dack!

Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his 
smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes 
in the distance.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH AREA

Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around 
them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them 
explodes in a ball of flames.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the Rebel power 
generators in the distance.

A hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel screen.

				VEERS
		Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the 
		main power generator.  The shield 
		will be down in moments.  You may 
		start your landing.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE

		Rogue Three.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Copy, Rogue Leader

				LUKE 
			(over comlink) 
		Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll 
		have to make this shot.  I'll cover 
		for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow 
		me on the next pass.

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Coming around, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Steady, Rogue Two

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE
			(to gunner) 
		Activate harpoon.

Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon.  
The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the 
walker.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in 
one of the walker's legs.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE 
			(to gunner) 
		Good shot, Janson.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet, 
trailing the cable behind it.  Continuing around the back foot, Rogue 
Three then circles the walker around the tail end.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker.

				WEDGE
		One more pass.

				JANSON 
		Coming around.  Once more.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the 
cable behind it.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Once more.

Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker.

				JANSON
		Cable out!  Let her go!

				WEDGE
		Detach cable.

EXT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE

The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable 
drops away.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Cable detached.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the 
enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial 
walker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes 
onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.

An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen 
war machine.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Come on!

The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders 
flying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the 
impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the 
fallen walker.

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Whooha!  That got him!

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General 
Rieekan monitor computer screens.

				RIEEKAN
		I don't think we can protect two 
		transports at a time.

				LEIA 
		It's risky, but we can't hold out 
		much longer.  We have no choice.

				RIEEKAN
			(into comlink) 
		Launch patrols.

				LEIA
			(to an aide) 
		Evacuate remaining ground staff.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of 
the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han 
works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the 
wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient.

				HAN
		No, no!  No!  This one goes there, 
		that one goes there.  Right?

In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up 
into Luke's X-wing fighter.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you take good care of 
		Master Luke now, understand?  And
		... do take good care of yourself.  
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The 
Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, 
firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel 
troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions 
erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly 
explodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers studies various readouts on his control panel.

				VEERS
		All troops will debark for ground 
		assault.  Prepare to target the 
		main generator.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to 
left and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around 
them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke, glancing over, sees Rogue Two on his left.  His ship shudders as 
flak bursts nearby.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Rogue Two, are you all right?

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers.

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Coming around.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE

		Watch that cross fire, boys.

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Set for position three.
			(to gunner) 
		Steady.

				LUKE
			(over comlink) 
		Stay tight and low.

EXT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO

Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's 
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.  His ship bucks violently under the 
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.

Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.  Before 
they collide.  Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship.  
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.  Luke struggles 
with the controls with a look of terror on his face.  The speeder fills 
with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Hobbie, I've been hit!

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is 
strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing 
hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls 
and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the 
underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a 
shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a 
gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and 
Threepio near one of the control boards.

				HAN
		You all right?

Leia nods.  She is surprised to see him.

				LEIA
		Why are you still here?

				HAN
		I heard the command center had 
		been hit.

				LEIA
		You got your clearance to leave.

				HAN
		Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First 
		I'm going to get you to your ship.

				THREEPIO
		Your Highness, we must take this 
		last transport.  It's our only hope.

				LEIA
			(to controller) 
		Send all troops in sector twelve 
		to the south slope to protect the 
		fighters.

A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's 
arms.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker) 
		Imperial troops have entered the 
		base.

				HAN
		Come on... that's it.

				LEIA
			(to head controller) 
		Give the evacuation code signal.  
		And get to your transports!

Leia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.

As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code 
signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

				HEAD CONTROLLER
		K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

				THREEPIO
			(to Han and Leia) 
		Oh!  Wait for me!

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SNOW TRENCH

Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.

				OFFICER
		Begin retreat!

				SECOND OFFICER
		Fall back!

Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel 
headquarters.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH

Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever 
nearer.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN

On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over 
him.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing 
overhead.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at 
the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the 
gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.

Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his 
belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling 
underneath the walker.

The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen 
snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to 
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke 
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the 
Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto 
the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg 
passes by - and just misses him.

The giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from 
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every 
conceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like 
a locomotive on stilts.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The 
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right 
of Veers's path.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power 
generators.

				VEERS
		Distance to power generators?

				PILOT
		One-seven, decimal two-eight.

Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main 
generator.

				VEERS
		Target.  Maximum fire power.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the 
relentless Imperial assault.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS

With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling 
ice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the 
princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks 
their path.

He takes the comlink from his pocket.

				HAN 
			(into comlink) 
		Transport, this is Solo.  Better 
		take off - I can't get to you.  
		I'll get the princess out on the 
		Falcon.

Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

				THREEPIO
		But... but... but... where are 
		you going?  Uh... come back!!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Imperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the 
blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the 
Millennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

The door to the hangar closes in his face.

				THREEPIO
			(exasperated) 
		How typical.

Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid 
through.

				HAN
		Come on.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.  
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a 
few reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain, 
something at last catches his eye.

Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward 
the ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, 
then runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, 
closely followed by Threepio.

				HAN
		Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're 
		going to be a permanent resident!

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Imperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the 
place.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly, 
purposefully, continues around it.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come 
crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD

Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as 
Chewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their 
efforts.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		How's this?

The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

				LEIA
		Would it helped if I got out and 
		pushed?

				HAN
		It might.

Threepio clanks into the hold.

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, 
		might I suggest that you...

Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

				THREEPIO
		It can wait.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia 
watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

				LEIA
		This bucket of bolts is never going 
		to get us past that blockade.

				HAN
		This baby's got a few surprises 
		left in her, sweetheart.

Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of 
stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.

Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the 
navigator's chair.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them 
the giant hangar doors open slowly.

EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the 
Imperial troops.

The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by 
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

				HAN
		Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
		Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.  
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and 
the first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at 
Leia.

				HAN
		See?

				LEIA
		Someday you're going to be wrong, 
		and I hope I'm there to see it.

Han looks at Chewie.

				HAN
		Punch it!

The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.  
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks 
toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and 
disappear outside the cave.

EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY

Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above 
them, flying very close to the ground.

The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing 
fighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads 
toward his own fighter.  

Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke 
climbs aboard the spacecraft.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for 
takeoff.

				WEDGE
		Good luck, Luke.  See you at 
		the rendezvous.

Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of 
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.

				LUKE
		Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going, 
		we're going.

The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.  
Soon it disappears into the stars.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several 
switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.  
The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.

The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from 
the concerned Artoo.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
		I'm just setting a new course.

Artoo beeps once again.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're not going to regroup with 
		the others.

Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"

Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're going to the Dagobah system.

Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along 
with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.  
Finally, Artoo chirps up.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, Artoo?

Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

				LUKE
			(into comlink, chuckling)
		That's all right.  I'd like to 
		keep it on manual control for a 
		while.

The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and 
continues on his course.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one 
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.

As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized 
objects.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the 
ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things 
at once.

				HAN
			(harried)
		I saw them!  I saw them!

				LEIA
		Saw what?

				HAN
		Star Destroyers, two of them, 
		coming right at us.

Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Shut him up or shut him down!
			(to Chewie)
		Check the deflector shield!

Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

				HAN
		Oh, great.  Well, we can still 
		outmaneuver them.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS

The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight 
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star 
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen 
veering to the left.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Take evasive action!

Alarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get 
closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes 
brushing contact with it.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS

The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, 
still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black 
skies.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie 
barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.  
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

				HAN
		Prepare to make the jump to light-
		speed.

				THREEPIO
		But, sir!

The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

				LEIA
		They're getting closer!

				HAN
			(with a gleam in his 
			 eye)
		Oh yeah?  Watch this.

Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into 
hyperspace, but just sit there.

Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of 
concern.

				LEIA
		Watch what?

Han tries again.  Still nothing.

				HAN
		I think we're in trouble.

				THREEPIO
		If I may say so, sir, I noticed 
		earlier that the hyperdrive 
		motivator has been damaged.  It's 
		impossible to go to light-speed!

				HAN
		We're in trouble!

The explosions become heavier.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER

The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four 
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders 
to Chewie.

				HAN
		Horizontal boosters...!
			(Chewie barks)
		Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's 
		not it.
			(Chewie barks)
		Bring me the hydrospanners!

Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.

				HAN
		I don't know how we're going to 
		get out of this one.

Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch 
radically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.

				HAN
		Oww!  Chewie!

More turbulence rocks the ship.

				HAN
		That was no laser blast!  Something 
		hit us.

				LEIA
			(over comlink)
		Han, get up here!

				HAN
		Come on, Chewie!

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of 
the hold and toward the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.

				LEIA
		Asteroids!

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie 
gets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses 
in front of the ship.

				HAN
		Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
		one.

				LEIA
		What are you doing?  You're not 
		actually going into an asteroid 
		field?

				HAN
		They'd be crazy to follow us, 
		wouldn't they?

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.

				LEIA
		You don't have to do this to 
		impress me.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the possibility of successfully 
		navigating an asteroid field is 
		approximately three thousand, seven 
		hundred and twenty to one.

				HAN
		Never tell me the odds!

EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its 
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.  
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small 
explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in 
every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium 
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain 
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the 
asteroids.

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and 
explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of 
smaller explosions.

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly 
banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot 
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out 
of control into deep space.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT

The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the 
Falcon.  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT

The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.  
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft 
through the dangerous field.

Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid 
drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially 
close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.  
Threepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the 
cockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.  
Han gives her a quick look.

				HAN
		You said you wanted to be around 
		when I made a mistake; well, this 
		could be it, sweetheart.

				LEIA
		I take it back.  We're going to 
		get pulverized if we stay out here 
		much longer.

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.

				HAN
		I'm not going to argue with that.

				THREEPIO
		Pulverized?

				HAN
		I'm going in closer to one of 
		those big ones.

				LEIA
		Closer?

				THREEPIO
		Closer?!

Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized 
asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the 
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.  
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.  
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, 
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles 
directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it 
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep 
space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in 
hysterics.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, this is suicide!

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful 
Wookiee, pointing.

				HAN
		There.  That looks pretty good.

				LEIA
		What looks pretty good?

				HAN
		Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

				THREEPIO
			(to Leia)
		Excuse me, ma'am, but where are 
		we going?

Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of 
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LEIA
		I hope you know what you're doing.

				HAN
		Yeah, me too.

INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as 
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on 
one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into 
it.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo, 
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with 
some anxiety.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the 
computer scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, I'm not going to change my 
		mind about this.
			(getting a little nervous)
		I'm not picking up any cities or
		technology.  Massive life-form 
		readings, though.  There's something
		alive down there...

Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe 
		for droids.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING

The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.  
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has 
completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background, 
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		I know, I know!  All the scopes are 
		dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just 
		hang on, I'm going to start the 
		landing cycle...

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's 
electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs 
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the 
spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out 
of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which 
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make 
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.

				LUKE
		No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll 
		have a look around.

Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses 
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.

				LUKE
		Artoo?

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water 
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Where are you?

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is 
heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts 
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  You be more careful.

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.

Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and 
turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward 
shore.

				LUKE
		Artoo - that way!

Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving 
toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the 
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The 
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into 
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.

				LUKE
		Artoo!

The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin 
to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the 
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of 
soft gray moss.

				LUKE
		Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come 
		on.  You're lucky you don't taste 
		very good.  Anything broken?

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from 
his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.

				LUKE
		If you're saying coming here was 
		a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree 
		with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we 
		doing here?  It's like... something 
		out of a dream, or, I don't know.  
		Maybe I'm just going crazy.

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, 
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.

EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.

After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising 
sight before him.

Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far 
side of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the 
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts 
from Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar 
tissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet 
onto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face 
Piett.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral?

				PIETT
Our ships have sighted the 
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But... 
it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk...

				VADER
			(interrupting)
		Asteroids do not concern me, 
		Admiral.  I want that ship and 
		not excuses.

				PIETT
		Yes, lord.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so 
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.  
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

				HAN
		I'm going to shut down everything 
		but the emergency power systems.  

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, 
		but... does that include shutting 
		me down, too?

Chewie barks "yes".  But Han thinks otherwise.

				HAN
		No, I need you to talk to the 
		Falcon, find out what's wrong with 
		the hyperdrive.

Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit 
to go flying.  Chewie howls.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, it's quite possible this 
		asteroid is not entirely stable.

				HAN
		Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're 
		here to tell us these things.  Chewie, 
		take the professor in the back and 
		plug him into the hyperdrive.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Sometimes I just don't 
		understand human behavior.  After 
		all, I'm only trying to do my job 
		in the most...

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he 
move back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia 
across the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as 
suddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they 
are in each other's arms.

				LEIA
		Let go.

				HAN
		Sshh!

				LEIA
		Let go, please.

Leia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get 
free.  But, of course, Han blows it...

				HAN
		Don't get excited.

The anger rises in Leia.

				LEIA
		Captain, being held by you isn't 
		quite enough to get me excited.

				HAN
		Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't 
		got time for anything else.

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the 
door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK

The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking 
swamp.

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites 
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power 
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.

				LUKE
		Ready for some power?  Okay.  
		Let's see now.  Put that in 
		there.  There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of 
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

				LUKE
			(sighs)
		Now all I have to do is find this 
		Yoda... if he even exists.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

				LUKE
		Still... there's something familiar 
		about this place.  I feel like... 
		I don't know...

				STRANGE VOICE
		Feel like what?

Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young 
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the 
speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, 
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing 
is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

				LUKE
			(looking at the 
			 creature)
		Like we're being watched!

				CREATURE
		Away with your weapon!  I mean 
		you no harm.

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really 
doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.

				CREATURE
		I am wondering, why are you here?

				LUKE
		I'm looking for someone.

				CREATURE
		Looking?  Found someone, you have, 
		I would say, hmmm?

The little creature laughs.

				LUKE
			(Trying to keep from 
			 smiling)
		Right.

				CREATURE
		Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

				LUKE
		I don't think so.  I'm looking 
		for a great warrior.

				CREATURE
		Ahhh!  A great warrior.
			(laughs and shakes 
			 his head)
		Wars not make one great.

With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of 
the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.

Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the 
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his 
disapproval.

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from 
and takes a bite.

				LUKE
		Put that down.  Hey!  That's my 
		dinner!

The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.

				CREATURE
		How you get so big, eating food 
		of this kind?

He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of 
Luke's supply cases.

				LUKE
		Listen, friend, we didn't mean to 
		land in that puddle, and if we 
		could get our ship out, we would, 
		but we can't, so why don't you just...

				CREATURE
			(teasing)
		Aww, cannot get your ship out?

The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses 
patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a 
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.

				LUKE
		Hey, you could have broken this.
		Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're 
		making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

				CREATURE
			(retreating with 
			 the lamp)
		Mine!  Or I will help you not.

Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing 
closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little 
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by 
the creature.

				LUKE
		I don't want your help.  I want 
		my lamp back.  I'll need it to 
		get out of this slimy mudhole.

				CREATURE
		Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately 
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.

Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

				CREATURE
		Ah, ah, ah!

				LUKE
		Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

				CREATURE
		Mine!  Mine!

				LUKE
		Artoo!

				CREATURE
		Mine!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one 
finger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

				CREATURE
		Mine!

				LUKE
			(fed up)
		Now will you move along, little 
		fella?  We're got a lot of work 
		to do.

				CREATURE
		No!  No, no!  Stay and help you, 
		I will.
			(laughs)
		Find your friend, hmm?

				LUKE
		I'm not looking for a friend. 
		I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

				CREATURE
		Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You 
		seek Yoda.

				LUKE
		You know him?

				CREATURE
		Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
			(laughs)
		Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
		Come.  Good food.  Come.

With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.  
Luke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small 
power lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts 
after the creature.

				CREATURE
			(in the distance)
		Come, come.

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

				LUKE
		Stay here and watch after the 
		camp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view, 
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic 
sigh.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in 
front of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, where is Artoo when I need 
		him?

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I don't know where your ship 
		learned to communicate, but it 
		has the most peculiar dialect.  I 
		believe, sir, it says that the 
		power coupling on the negative 
		axis has been polarized.  I'm 
		afraid you'll have to replace it.

				HAN
		Well, of course I'll have to replace 
		it.

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.

				HAN
		Here!  And Chewie...

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and 
whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so 
only he can hear.

				HAN
			(continuing)
		... I think we'd better replace 
		the negative power coupling.

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts 
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It 
doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She 
rebuffs him.

				HAN
		Hey, Your Worship, I'm only 
		trying to help.

				LEIA
			(still struggling)
		Would you please stop calling me 
		that?

Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.

				HAN
		Sure, Leia.

				LEIA
		Oh, you make it so difficult 
		sometimes.

				HAN
		I do, I really do.  You could be 
		a little nicer, though.
			(he watches her 
			 reaction)
		Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you 
		think I'm all right.

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

				LEIA
		Occasionally...
			(a little smile, 
			 haltingly)
		... when you aren't acting like 
		a scoundrel.

				HAN
			(laughs)
		Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like 
		the sound of that.

With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

				LEIA
		Stop that.

				HAN
		Stop what?

Leia is flushes, confused.

				LEIA
		Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

				HAN
		My hands are dirty, too.  What 
		are you afraid of?

				LEIA
			(looking right 
			 into his eyes)
		Afraid?

Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more 
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and 
takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He 
draws it toward him.

				HAN
		You're trembling.

				LEIA
		I'm not trembling.

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... 
very slowly.

				HAN
		You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
		There aren't enough scoundrels in 
		your life.

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an 
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.

				LEIA
		I happen to like nice men.

				HAN
		I'm a nice man.

				LEIA
		No, you're not.  You're...

He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though 
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed 
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it 
hard to talk.

Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  I've isolated the 
		reverse power flux coupling.

Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

				HAN
		Thank you.  Thank you very much.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently 
seeking its prey.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge 
window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control 
deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the 
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images, 
the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.  
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is 
faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain 
Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the 
Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark 
Lord.

				NEEDA
			(in hologram)
		... and that, Lord Vader, was the 
		last time they appeared in any of 
		our scopes.  Considering the amount 
		of damage we've sustained, they 
		must have been destroyed.

				VADER
		No, Captain, they're alive.  I 
		want every ship available to 
		sweep the asteroid field until 
		they are found.

The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
Lord Vader.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral, what is it?

The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

				PIETT
		The Emperor commands you make 
		contact with him.

				VADER
		Move the ship out of the asteroid 
		field so that we can send a clear 
		transmission.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars 
away from the rest of the fleet.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound 
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.  
He looks up and bows quickly.

A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before 
Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the 
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more 
frightening than Vader's.

				VADER
		What is thy bidding, my master?

				EMPEROR
		There is a great disturbance in 
		the Force.

				VADER
		I have felt it.

				EMPEROR
		We have a new enemy - Luke 
		Skywalker.

				VADER
		Yes, my master.

				EMPEROR
		He could destroy us.

				VADER
		He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no 
		longer help him.

				EMPEROR
		The Force is strong with him.  The 
		son of Skywalker must not become a 
		Jedi.

				VADER
		If he could be turned, he would 
		become a powerful ally.

				EMPEROR
		Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great 
		asset.  Can it be done?

				VADER
		He will join us or die, my 
		master.

Vader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord 
of the Sith and fades away.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange 
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small 
lagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its 
thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, 
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of 
the glowing portals.

INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE

Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very 
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, 
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits 
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.

The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up 
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding 
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who 
watches the creature impatiently.

				LUKE
		Look, I'm sure it's delicious.  
		I just don't understand why we 
		can't see Yoda now.

				CREATURE
		Patience!  For the Jedi it is 
		time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.  
		Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down 
near the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar 
concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

				LUKE
		How far away is Yoda?  Will it 
		take us long to get there?

				CREATURE
		Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
		Soon you will be with him.
			(tasting food from 
			 the pot)
		Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you 
		become Jedi?  Hm?

				LUKE
		Mostly because of my father, I 
		guess.

				CREATURE
		Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi 
		was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

				LUKE
			(a little angry)
		Oh, come on.  How could you know 
		my father?  You don't even know 
		who I am.
			(fed up)
		Oh, I don't know what I'm doing 
		here.  We're wasting our time.

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.

				CREATURE
			(irritated)
		I cannot teach him.  The boy has 
		no patience.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no 
one there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that 
the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking 
with Ben.

				BEN'S VOICE
		He will learn patience.

				YODA
		Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Was I any different when you 
		taught me?

				YODA
		Hah.  He is not ready.

				LUKE
		Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I 
		can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm 
		ready.

Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low 
ceiling.

				YODA
		Ready, are you?  What know you 
		of ready?  For eight hundred years 
		have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel 
		will I keep on who is to be trained!
		A Jedi must have the deepest 
		commitment, the most serious mind.
			(to the invisible 
			 Ben, indicating Luke)
		This one a long time have I watched.
		All his life has he looked away...
		to the future, to the horizon.
		Never his mind on where he was.
		Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.  
		Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!  
		A Jedi craves not these things.
			(turning to Luke)
		You are reckless!

Luke looks down.  He knows it is true.

				BEN'S VOICE
		So was I, if you'll remember.

				YODA
		He is too old.  Yes, too old to 
		begin the training.

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge 
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a 
long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Will he finished what he begins?

				LUKE
		I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

				YODA
			(turns slowly toward 
			 him)
		Oh, you will be.  You will be.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid 
storm.  Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing 
ships.  One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid 
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the 
control panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the 
confusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the 
cockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights 
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the 
windscreen.  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open 
and stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her 
heart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in 
an instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath, 
jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

The lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and 
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

				HAN
		I'm not really interested in your 
		opinion, Threepio.

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into 
place.

				LEIA
			(out of breath)
		There's something out there.

				HAN
		Where?

				LEIA
		Outside, in the cave.

As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks 
up and barks anxiously.

				THREEPIO
		There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

				HAN
		I'm going out there.

				LEIA
		Are you crazy?!

				HAN
		I just got this bucket back 
		together.  I'm not going to let 
		something tear it apart.

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia 
follows.

				LEIA
		Then I'm going with you.

				THREEPIO
		I think it might be better if I 
		stay here and guard the ship.
			(hears another 
			 mysterious noise)
		Oh, no.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is 
attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

				LEIA
		This ground sure feels strange.
		It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline 
of the cave.

				HAN
		There's an awful lot of moisture 
		in here.

				LEIA
		I don't know.  I have a bad feeling 
		about this.

				HAN
		Yeah.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's 
cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of 
the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it 
with a laser bolt.

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Watch out!

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front 
of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.

				HAN
		Yeah, that's what I thought.
		Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest 
		of the ship, make sure there 
		aren't any more attached.  They're 
		chewing on the power cables.

				LEIA
		Mynocks?

				HAN
		Go on inside.  We'll clean them 
		off if there are any more.

Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia 
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the 
ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of 
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit 
window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

				THREEPIO
		Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly 
		little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

				HAN
		Wait a minute...

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.  
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.  
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their 
faces and run up the platform.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA

As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.  
The ship continues to shake and heave.

				HAN
		All right, Chewie, let's get 
		out of here!

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes 
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia 
hurries after.

				LEIA
		The Empire is still out there.
		I don't think it's wise to...

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

				HAN
			(interrupting)
		No time to discuss this in
		committee.

And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to 
whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.

				LEIA
			(angry)
		I am not a committee!

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The 
cave-quake has greatly diminished.

				LEIA
		You can't make the jump to light-
		speed in this asteroid field...

				HAN
		Sit down, sweetheart.  We're 
		taking off!

As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something 
out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.

				THREEPIO
		Look!

				HAN
		I see it, I see it.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen 
surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the 
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the 
throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

				THREEPIO
		We're doomed!

				LEIA
		The cave is collapsing.

				HAN
		This is no cave.

				LEIA
		What?

Leia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance 
are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny 
ship.  Chewie howls.

INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH

The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on 
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth 
before the huge jaws slams closed.

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID

The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon 
flies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the 
starship fly away.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID

The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of 
the asteroid storm.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY

With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick 
vines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course 
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in 
and out of the heavy ground fog.

				YODA
		Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength 
		flows from the Force.  But beware 
		of the dark side.  Anger... fear... 
		aggression.  The dark side of 
		the Force are they.
		Easily they flow, quick to join 
		you in a fight.  If once you 
		start down the dark path, forever 
		will it dominate your destiny, 
		consume you it will, as it did 
		Obi-Wan's apprentice.

				LUKE
		Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

				YODA
		No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, 
		more seductive.

				LUKE
		But how am I to know the good side 
		from the bad?

				YODA
		You will know.  When you are calm, 
		at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses 
		the Force for knowledge and 
		defense, never for attack.

				LUKE
		But tell me why I can't...

				YODA
			(interrupting)
		No, no, there is no why.  Nothing 
		more will I teach you today.
		Clear your mind of questions.  
		Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.  
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and 
pulls it on.

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few 
feet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on 
one side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

				LUKE
		There's something not right here.

Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.

				LUKE
		I feel cold, death.

				YODA
		That place... is strong with the 
		dark side of the Force.  A domain 
		of evil it is.  In you must go.

				LUKE
		What's in there?

				YODA
		Only what you take with you.

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his 
weapon belt.

				YODA
		Your weapons... you will not 
		need them.

Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."  Yoda 
shrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters 
the tree.

INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.  
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit 
saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and 
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep 
breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.

The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.  
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is 
very quiet here.

Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, 
illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he 
charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but 
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.

Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders 
as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the 
helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the 
floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it 
cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to 
reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in 
terror.

The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK

Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.

EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its 
convoy of TIE fighters.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK

Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a 
motley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers 
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.

				PIETT
		Bounty hunters.  We don't need 
		that scum.

				FIRST CONTROLLER
		Yes, sir.

				PIETT
		Those Rebels won't escape us.

A second controller interrupts.

				SECOND CONTROLLER
		Sir, we have a priority signal 
		from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

				PIETT
		Right.

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune 
hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, 
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war 
droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

				VADER
		... there will be a substantial 
		reward for the one who finds the 
		Millennium Falcon.  You are free 
		to use any methods necessary, but 
		I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

				BOBA FETT
		As you wish.

At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader!  My lord, we have 
		them.

EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a 
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size 
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon 
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.  
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly 
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio 
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches 
tensely out the window.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, thank goodness we're coming 
		out of the asteroid field.

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A 
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side 
of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which 
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The 
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han corrects the angle of his ship.

				HAN
		Let's get out of here.  Ready for 
		light-speed?  One... two... three!

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak 
bursts continue to rock the ship.

				HAN
			(frantic)
		It's not fair!

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and 
captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.

				HAN
		The transfer circuits are working.
		It's not my fault!

Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

				LEIA
			(almost expecting 
			 it)
		No light-speed?

				HAN
		It's not my fault.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, we just lost the main rear 
		deflector shield.  One more direct 
		hit on the back quarter and we're 
		done for.

Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.

				HAN
		Turn her around.

Chewie barks in puzzlement.

				HAN
		I said turn her around!  I'm 
		going to put all power in the 
		front shield.

				LEIA
		You're going to attack them?!

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the odds of surviving a 
		direct assault on an Imperial 
		Star Destroyer...

				LEIA
		Shut up!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it 
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the 
massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface 
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous 
flak bursts.

INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE

The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials 
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low 
across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge 
area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain 
Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.

				NEEDA
		They're moving to attack 
		position!  Shields up!

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the 
last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet.

				NEEDA
		Track them.  They may come 
		around for another pass.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Captain Needa, the ship no longer 
		appears on our scopes.

				NEEDA
		They can't have disappeared.  No 
		ship that small has a cloaking 
		device.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Well, there's no trace of them, 
		sir.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Captain, Lord Vader demands an 
		update on the pursuit.

				NEEDA
			(drawing a breath)
		Get a shuttle ready.  I shall 
		assume full responsibility for 
		losing them, and apologize to Lord 
		Vader. Meanwhile, continue to 
		scan the area.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Yes, Captain Needa.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY

Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on 
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are 
two rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and 
concentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to 
rest on the other.

				YODA
		Use the Force.  Yes...

Yoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.  
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby, 
is whistling and beeping frantically.

				YODA
		Now... the stone.  Feel it.

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet, 
shaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, 
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.

				YODA
		Concentrate!

Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking 
urgently back and forth in front of him.

Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the 
edge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The 
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the 
lake's surface.

				LUKE
		Oh, no.  We'll never get it out 
		now.

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

				YODA
		So certain are you.  Always with 
		you it cannot be done.  Hear you
		nothing that I say?

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

				LUKE
		Master, moving stones around is 
		one thing.  This is totally 
		different.

				YODA
		No!  No different!  Only different 
		in your mind.  You must unlearn 
		what you have learned.

				LUKE
			(focusing, quietly)
		All right, I'll give it a try.

				YODA
		No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  
		There is no try.

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.

Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers 
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.

				LUKE
			(panting heavily)
		I can't.  It's too big.

				YODA
		Size matters not.  Look at me.  
		Judge me by my size, do you?  
		Hm?  Mmmm.

Luke shakes his head.

				YODA
		And well you should not.  For my 
		ally in the Force.  And a powerful 
		ally it is.  Life creates it, makes 
		it grow.  Its energy surrounds us 
		and binds us.  Luminous beings 
		are we...
			(Yoda pinches 
			 Luke's shoulder)
		... not this crude matter.
			(a sweeping gesture)
		You must feel the Force around you.
			(gesturing)
		Here, between you... me... the 
		tree... the rock... everywhere!  
		Yes, even between this land and 
		that ship!

				LUKE
			(discouraged)
		You want the impossible.

Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and 
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.

Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo 
beeps in terror and scoots away.

The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda 
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the 
beach.

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.  
He walks toward Yoda.

				LUKE
		I don't... I don't believe it.

				YODA
		That is why you fail.

Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star 
Destroyer, the Avenger.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then 
falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers 
pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett 
and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader, our ships have 
		completed their scan of the area 
		and found nothing.  If the 
		Millennium Falcon went into light-
		speed, it'll be on the other side 
		of the galaxy by now.

				VADER
		Alert all commands.  Calculate 
		every possible destination along 
		their last know trajectory.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

				VADER
		Don't fail me again, Admiral.

Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than 
when he arrived.

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the 
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on 
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the 
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, this time you have 
		gone too far.
			(Chewie growls)
		No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
		Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		The fleet is beginning to break 
		up.  Go back and stand by the 
		manual release for the landing claw.

Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.

				THREEPIO
		I really don't see how that is 
		going to help.  Surrender is a 
		perfectly acceptable alternative 
		in extreme circumstances.  The 
		Empire may be gracious enough...

Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.

				HAN
		Thank you.

				LEIA
		What did you have in mind for 
		your next move?

				HAN
		Well, if they follow standard 
		Imperial procedure, they'll dump 
		their garbage before they go to 
		light-speed, then we just float 
		away.

				LEIA
		With the rest of the garbage.
		Then what?

				HAN
		Then we've got to find a safe 
		port somewhere around here.  Got 
		any ideas?

				LEIA
		No.  Where are we?

				HAN
		The Anoat system.

				LEIA
		Anoat system.  There's not much 
		there.

				HAN
		No.  Well, wait.  This is 
		interesting.  Lando.

He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out 
of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points 
representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.

				LEIA
		Lando system?

				HAN
		Lando's not a system, he's a man.
		Lando Calrissian.  He's a card 
		player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd 
		like him.

				LEIA
		Thanks.

				HAN
		Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I 
		think we can make it.

				LEIA
			(reading from the 
			 computer)
		A mining colony?

				HAN
		Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando 
		conned somebody out of it.  We 
		go back a long way, Lando and me.

				LEIA
		Can you trust him?

				HAN
		No.  But he has no love for the
		Empire, I can tell you that.

Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and 
stretches to look out the cockpit window.

				HAN
			(into intercom)
		Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
		Detach!

Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She 
thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and 
she gives him a quick kiss.

				LEIA
		You do have your moments.  Not 
		many, but you have them.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its 
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the 
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars 
off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races 
off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's 
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but 
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda 
sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the 
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo 
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.  
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, 
looking for help.

				YODA
		Concentrate... feel the Force 
		flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.  
		Through the Force, things you 
		will see.  Other places.  The 
		future... the past.  Old friends 
		long gone.

Luke suddenly becomes distressed.

				LUKE
		Han!  Leia!

The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then 
Luke himself tumbles over.

				YODA
			(shaking his head)
		Hmm.  Control, control.  You must 
		learn control.

				LUKE
		I saw... I saw a city in the 
		clouds.

				YODA
		Mmm.  Friends you have there.

				LUKE
		They were in pain.

				YODA
It is the future you see.

				LUKE
		Future?  Will they die?

Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.

				YODA
		Difficult to see.  Always in 
		motion is the future.

				LUKE
		I've got to go to them.

				YODA
		Decide you must how to serve 
		them best.  If you leave now, 
		help them you could.  But you 
		would destroy all for which they 
		have fought and suffered.

Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds him as he nods his 
head sadly.

EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN

The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward 
the soft pink planet of Bespin.

EXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon 
as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.

Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.  
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the 
ship.  Chewie barks his concern.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		No, I don't have a landing 
		permit.  I'm trying to reach 
		Lando Calrissian.

More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's 
interior.  Leia looks worried.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me 
		explain.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		You will not deviate from your 
		present course.

				THREEPIO
		Rather touchy, aren't they?

				LEIA
		I thought you knew this person.

Chewie barks and growls at his boss.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Well, that was a long time ago.
		I'm sure he's forgotten about 
		that.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		Permission granted to land on 
		Platform Three-two-seven.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Thank you.

Angry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.  
Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

				HAN
		There's nothing to worry about.
		We go way back, Lando and me.

Leia doesn't look convinced.

				LEIA
		Who's worried?

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out 
of the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the 
gleaming white metropolis.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON

With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the 
Cloud City's platforms.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also 
armed, surveys the scene warily.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  No one to meet us.

				LEIA
		I don't like this.

				HAN
		Well, what would you like?

				THREEPIO
		Well, they did let us land.

				HAN
		Look, don't worry.  Everything's 
		going to be fine.  Trust me.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a 
group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing 
platform.

The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection 
of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim 
expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

				HAN
		See?  My friend.
			(to Chewie)
		Keep your eyes open, okay?

Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head 
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Lando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.  
Lando shakes his head.

				LANDO
		Why, you slimy, double-crossing, 
		no-good swindler!  You've got a 
		lot of guts coming here, after 
		what you pulled.

Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"

Lando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms 
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.

				LANDO
			(laughs)
		How you doing, you old pirate? 
		So good to see you!  I never thought 
		I'd catch up with you again.  Where 
		you been?

The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.

				THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.

				LEIA
			(wary)
		Yes... very friendly.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

				LANDO
		What are you doing here?

				HAN
			(gestures toward 
			 the Falcon)
		Ahh... repairs.  I thought you 
		could help me out.

				LANDO
			(in mock panic)
		What have you done to my ship?

				HAN
		Your ship?  Hey, remember, you 
		lost her to me fair and square.

Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess 
and smiles.

				LANDO
		Hello.  What have we here?  
		Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
		I'm the administrator of this 
		facility.  And who might you be?

				LEIA
		Leia.

				LANDO
		Welcome, Leia.

Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

				HAN
		All right, all right, you old 
		smoothie.

Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

				THREEPIO
		Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio, 
		human-cyborg relations.  My 
		facilities are at your...

Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to 
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.

				THREEPIO
		Well, really!

Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, 
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

				LANDO
		What's wrong with the Falcon?

				HAN
		Hyperdrive.

				LANDO
		I'll get my people to work on it.

				HAN
		Good.

Lando turns to Leia.

				LANDO
		You know, that ship saved my life 
		quite a few times.  She's the 
		fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They 
walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and 
passing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.

				HAN
		How's the gas mine?  Is it 
		paying off for you?

				LANDO
		Oh, not as well as I'd like.
		We're a small outpost and not 
		very self-sufficient.  And I've 
		had supply problems of every kind.
		I've had labor difficulties...
			(catches Han 
			 grinning at him)
		What's so funny?

				HAN
		You.  Listen to you - you sound 
		like a businessman, a responsible 
		leader.  Who'd have thought that, 
		huh?

Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.

				LANDO
		You know, seeing you sure 
		brings back a few things.

				HAN
		Yeah.

				LANDO
			(shakes his head)
		Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
		It's the price you pay for being 
		successful.

Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the 
corridor.

The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming 
out of a door.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

				SECOND THREEPIO
			(mumbles)
		E chu ta!

				THREEPIO
		How rude!

Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the 
muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the 
room.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Curious, Threepio enters the room.

				THREEPIO
		That sounds like an R2 unit in 
		there.  I wonder if...

Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.

				THREEPIO
		Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

				MAN'S VOICE
			(from within)
		Who are you?

				THREEPIO
		Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I 
		didn't mean to intrude.  No, no, 
		please don't get up.  No!

A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.  
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door 
whooshes closed behind him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's 
dreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but 
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK

In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the 
belly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into 
his cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.

				YODA
		Luke!  You must complete the 
		training.

				LUKE
		I can't keep the vision out of my 
		head.  They're my friends.  I've 
		got to help them.

				YODA
		You must not go!

				LUKE
		But Han and Leia will die if I 
		don't.

				BEN'S VOICE
		You don't know that.

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a 
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence 
stops Luke.

				BEN
		Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

				LUKE
		But I can help them!  I feel 
		the Force!

				BEN
		But you cannot control it.  This 
		is a dangerous time for you, 
		when you will be tempted by the 
		dark side of the Force.

				YODA
		Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
		The cave.  Remember your failure 
		at the cave!

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much since 
		then.  Master Yoda, I promise to 
		return and finish what I've begun. 
		You have my word.

				BEN
		It is you and your abilities the 
		Emperor wants.  that is why your 
		friends are made to suffer.

				LUKE
		And that is why I have to go.

				BEN
		Luke, I don't want to lose you to 
		the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

				LUKE
		You won't.

				YODA
		Stopped they must be.  On this 
		all depends.  Only a fully trained 
		Jedi Knight with the Force as his 
		ally will conquer Vader and his 
		Emperor.  If you end your training 
		now, if you choose the quick and 
		easy path, as Vader did, you will 
		become an agent of evil.

				BEN
		Patience.

				LUKE
		And sacrifice Han and Leia?

				YODA
		If you honor what they fight for
		... yes!

Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle 
raging in his mind.

				BEN
		If you choose to face Vader, you 
		will do it alone.  I cannot 
		interfere.

				LUKE
		I understand.
			(he moves to his 
			 X-wing)
		Artoo, fire up the converters.

Artoo whistles a happy reply.

				BEN
		Luke, don't give in to hate - 
		that leads to the dark side.

Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

				YODA
		Strong is Vader.  Mind what you 
		have learned.  Save you it can.

				LUKE
		I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of 
the engines and the wind engulf them.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Told you, I did.  Reckless is 
		he.  Now matters are worse.

				BEN
		That boy is our last hope.

				YODA
			(looks up)
		No.  There is another.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH

Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and 
off into space.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in 
agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a 
lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves 
from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the 
doorway.

				HAN
		The ship is almost finished.
		Two or Three more things and 
		we're in great shape.

				LEIA
		The sooner the better.  Something's 
		wrong here.  No one has seen or 
		knows anything about Threepio.
		He's been gone too long to have 
		gotten lost.

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

				HAN
		Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and 
		see what I can find out.

				LEIA
		I don't trust Lando.

				HAN
		Well, I don't trust him, either.
		But he is my friend.  Besides, 
		we'll soon be gone.

				LEIA
		And then you're as good as gone, 
		aren't you?

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM

The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four 
Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some 
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten 
metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie 
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting 
Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, 
then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from 
him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until 
Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the 
ground.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of 
Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

				LEIA
		What happened?

Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

				HAN
		Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

				LEIA
		Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you 
		think you can repair him?

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the 
princess and shrugs sadly.

				HAN
		Lando's got people who can fix 
		him.

				LEIA
		No, thanks.

There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

				LANDO
		I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting 
		anything?

				LEIA
		Not really.

				LANDO
		You look absolutely beautiful.
		You truly belong here with us 
		among the clouds.

				LEIA
			(coolly)
		Thank you.

				LANDO
		Will you join me for a little 
		refreshment?

Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of 
food and licks his lips.

				LANDO
		Everyone's invited, of course.

Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando 
spots Threepio's remains.

				LANDO
		Having trouble with you droid?

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

				HAN
		No.  No problem.  Why?

Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and 
Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance 
behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, 
pure-white columns.

				LANDO
		So you see, since we're a small 
		operation, we don't fall into 
		the... uh... jurisdiction of the 
		Empire.

				LEIA
		So you're part of the mining 
		guild then?

				LANDO
		No, not actually.  Our operation 
		is small enough not to be noticed... 
		which is advantageous for everybody 
		since our customers are anxious 
		to avoid attracting attention to 
		themselves.

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at 
the far end.

				HAN
		Aren't you afraid the Empire's 
		going to find out about this 
		little operation and shut you down?

				LANDO
		That's always been a danger looming 
		like a shadow over everything we've 
		built here.  But things have 
		developed that will insure security.
		I've just made a deal that will 
		keep the Empire out of here forever.

INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM

The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the 
dining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty 
hunter.

Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a 
couple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his 
hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they 
explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's 
hand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of 
him.

				VADER
		We would be honored if you would 
		join us.

Han gives Lando a mean look.

				LANDO
		I had no choice.  They arrived 
right before you did.  I'm sorry.
		
				HAN
		I'm sorry, too.

EXT.  LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM

Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining 
city.  Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, Threepio's with them.

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Just hang on.  We're almost there.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle 
screeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper 
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He 
picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, 
barking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.

Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches 
two connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.

				THREEPIO
		Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take 
		this off!  I, uh, don't mean to 
		intrude here.  I, don't, no, no, 
		no... Please don't get up.  No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry 
head.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio 
immediately begins speaking normally.

				THREEPIO
		Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in 
		danger.  I must tell the others.
		Oh, no!  I've been shot!

INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an 
elaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts 
forward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism, 
creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a 
sharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding 
chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER

				LANDO
		Lord Vader.

				VADER
			(to Fett)
		You may take Captain Solo to 
		Jabba the Hut after I have 
		Skywalker.

Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

				BOBA FETT
		He's no good to me dead.

				VADER
		He will not be permanently damaged.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, what about Leia and 
		the Wookiee?

				VADER
		They must never again leave this 
		city.

				LANDO
		That was never a condition of our 
		agreement, nor was giving Han to 
		this bounty hunter!

				VADER
		Perhaps you think you're being 
		treated unfairly.

				LANDO
		No.

				VADER
		Good.  It would be unfortunate if 
		I had to leave a garrison here.

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks 
swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.

				LANDO
		This deal's getting worse all 
		the time.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is 
connected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small 
problem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's 
head on backwards.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like 
		that.  Oh!  Something's not right 
		because now I can't see.  Wait.  
		Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?  
		I'm backwards, you stupid furball.  
		Only an overgrown mophead like you 
		would be stupid enough...

Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a 
circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and 
sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is 
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the 
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles 
under his eyes.

				HAN
		I feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open 
revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers 
push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han, 
who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking 
his head.

				LEIA
		Why are they doing this?

				HAN
		They never even asked me any 
		questions.

The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.

				LEIA
		Lando.

				HAN
		Get out of here, Lando!

				LANDO
		Shut up and listen!  Vader has 
		agreed to turn Leia and Chewie 
		over to me.

				HAN
		Over to you?

				LANDO
		They'll have to stay here, but at 
		least they'll be safe.

				LEIA
		What about Han?

				LANDO
		Vader's giving him to the bounty 
		hunter.

				LEIA
		Vader wants us all dead.

				LANDO
		He doesn't want you at all.  He's 
		after somebody called Skywalker.

				HAN
		Luke?

				LANDO
		Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

Leia's mind is racing.

				LEIA
		And we're the bait.

				LANDO
		Well, he's on his way.

Han's rage peaks.

				HAN
		Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty 
		good, didn't you?
			(spits it out)
		My friend!

Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged 
in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle 
butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the 
guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando 
stops them.

				LANDO
		Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm 
		sorry I couldn't do better, but 
		I have my own problems.

				HAN
		Yeah, you're a real hero.

Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia 
and Chewie help him up.

				LEIA
			(dabs at his wound)
		You certainly have a way with 
		people.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large 
chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle 
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader 
and Lando stand near the platform.

				VADER
		This facility is crude, but it 
		should be adequate to freeze 
		Skywalker for his journey to the 
		Emperor.

An Imperial soldier appears.

				IMPERIAL SOLDIER
		Lord Vader, ship approaching.
		X-wing class.

				VADER
		Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow 
		him to land.

The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, we only use this 
		facility for carbon freezing.  If 
		you put him in there, it might 
		kill him.

				VADER
		I do not want the Emperor's prize 
		damaged.  We will test it... on 
		Captain Solo.

Lando's face registers dismay.

EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six 
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special 
coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a 
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to 
Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is 
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's 
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see 
what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, 
intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The 
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back 
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

				THREEPIO
		If only you had attached my legs, 
		I wouldn't be in this ridiculous 
		position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, 
		you have a responsibility to me, 
		so don't do anything foolish.

				HAN
			(to Lando)
		What's going on... buddy?

				LANDO
		You're being put into carbon freeze.

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

				BOBA FETT
		What if he doesn't survive?  He's 
		worth a lot to me.

				VADER
		The Empire will compensate you 
		if he dies.  Put him in!

Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and 
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other 
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee 
with their laser weapons.

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in 
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, 
		Chewbacca, stop...!

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

				HAN
		Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear 
		me?  Stop!

				THREEPIO
		Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready 
		to die.

Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him 
go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

				HAN
		Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help 
		me.  Hey!

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

				HAN
		Save your strength.  There'll be 
		another time.  The princess - you 
		have to take care of her.  You 
		hear me?

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too 
distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look 
sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a 
final, passionate kiss.

				LEIA
		I love you!

				HAN
		I know.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to 
the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and 
then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in 
agony.

Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.

Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and 
fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns 
away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.

				THREEPIO
		What... what's going on?  Turn 
		round, Chewbacca, I can't see.  
		Oh... they've encased him in 
		carbonite.  He should be quite 
		well-protected - if he survives 
		the freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an 
angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate 
out of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush 
over and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the 
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it 
inside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step 
away.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He 
shakes his head in relief.

				VADER
		Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

				LANDO
		Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect 
		hibernation.

Vader turns to Boba Fett.

				VADER
		He's all yours bounty hunter.
		Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Skywalker has just landed, my 
		lord.

				VADER
		Good.  See to it that he finds 
		his way here.  Calrissian, take 
		the princess and the Wookiee to 
		my ship.

				LANDO
		You said they'd be left in the 
		city under my supervision.

				VADER
		I am altering the deal.  Pray I 
		don't alter it any further.

Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, 
Chewie, and Threepio.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a 
group of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited 
series of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops 
in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the 
floating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, 
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon 
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The 
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and 
fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a 
huge chunk of wall.

Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, 
Han, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a 
second hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time 
to see Luke.

				LEIA
		Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a 
		trap!  It's a trap!

Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears 
from sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing 
behind.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the 
others are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the 
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes 
slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, 
echoing through the chamber.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He 
whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the 
other direction.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM

Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an 
opening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he 
stands on begins to move.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is 
deathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else 
seems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.

Steam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, 
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters 
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, 
eager to engage his enemy.

				VADER
		The Force is with you, young 
		Skywalker.  But you are not a 
		Jedi yet.

Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is 
lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and 
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, 
guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where 
Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia 
and one to Lando.

				LANDO
		Well done.  Hold them in the 
		security tower - and keep it 
		quiet.  Move.

As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to 
undo Chewie's binding.

				LEIA
		What do you think you're doing?

				LANDO
		We're getting out of here.

				THREEPIO
		I knew all along it had to be a 
		mistake.

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

				LEIA
		Do you think that after what you 
		did to Han we're going to trust 
		you?

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		I had no choice...

Chewie barks ferociously.

				THREEPIO
			(to Chewie)
		What are you doing?  Trust him, 
		trust him!

				LEIA
		Oh, so we understand, don't we, 
		Chewie?  He had no choice.

				LANDO
		I'm just trying to help...

				LEIA
		We don't need any of your help.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		H-a-a-a...

				LEIA
		What?

				THREEPIO
		It sounds like Han.

				LANDO
		There's still a chance to save 
		Han... I mean, at the East 
		Platform...

				LEIA
		Chewie.

Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.

				THREEPIO
			(to Lando)
		I'm terribly sorry about all this. 
		After all, he's only a Wookiee.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP

The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of 
the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to 
the cargo hold.

				BOBA FETT
		Put Captain Solo in the cargo 
		hold.

And with that, the door slams shut.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly 
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you 
		been?

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be 
spun out of sight of his friend.

				THREEPIO
		Turn around, you wooly...! 
			(to Artoo)
		Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to 
		save Han from the bounty hunter!

Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing 
group.

				THREEPIO
		Well, at least your still in 
		one piece!  Look what happened to 
		me!

EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY

An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a 
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.

Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset 
sky.  

In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind 
		you!

A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what 
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad 
of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the 
elevator.

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break 
for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess 
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out 
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely 
notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of 
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.

But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser 
fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut 
and the stormtroopers race forward.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the 
chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively 
drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.

				VADER
		You have learned much, young one.

				LUKE
		You'll find I'm full of surprises.

Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and 
sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the 
youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls 
down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he 
sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up 
to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls 
away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his 
enemy.

				VADER
		Your destiny lies with me, 
		Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to 
		be true.

				LUKE
		No!

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All 
the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.

Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and 
falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant 
freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and 
deactivates his sword.

				VADER
		All to easy.  Perhaps you are not 
		as strong as the Emperor thought.

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal 
begins to pour into the pit.

Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped 
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the 
carbonite outlet.

				VADER
		Impressive... most impressive.

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the 
steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had 
fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his 
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights 
his sword as well.

				VADER
		Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You 
		have controlled your fear... now 
		release your anger.

Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as 
Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he 
has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  
Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.

				VADER
		Only your hatred can destroy me.

Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to 
fill up with steam.

Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, 
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The 
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of 
collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of 
Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers 
himself into the pit.

INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the 
reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward 
a large window as Vader enters.

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall 
and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in 
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, 
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an 
invisible shield.

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  
Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all 
sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is 
bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes 
flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, 
unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his 
deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to 
scramble up.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the 
door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a 
moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as 
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a 
rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando 
punches desperately at the door's control panel.

				LANDO
		The security codes has been changed!

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you can tell the computer 
		to override the security system.

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps 
and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's 
intercom.

				LANDO
		Attention!  This is Lando
		Calrissian.  The Empire has takes 
		control of the city.  I advise 
		everyone to leave before more 
		Imperial troops arrive.

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the 
socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's 
circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out 
underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.

				LANDO
		This way.

Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots 
along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.

				THREEPIO
		Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. 
		I'm not supposed to know a power 
		socket from a computer terminal.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.  
Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.  
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back 
at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while 
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.

				THREEPIO
		What are you talking about?  We're 
		not interested in the hyperdrive 
		on the Millennium Falcon.  It's 
		fixed!  Just open the door, you 
		stupid lump.

Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep 
from Artoo - and the door snaps open.

				THREEPIO
			(to Artoo)
		I never doubted you for a second.
		Wonderful!

Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes 
outside.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers 
reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the 
droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the 
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.

				THREEPIO
		Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend 
		down, you thoughtless... Ow!

Chewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando 
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

				LANDO
		Leia!  Go!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR

Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the 
Falcon.

				THREEPIO
		I thought that hairy beast would 
		be the end of me.  Of course, I've 
		looked better.

Artoo beeps understandingly.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches 
over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship 
begins to move.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK

The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars 
away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in 
pursuit.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet 
Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke 
backward toward the gantry.

				VADER
		You are beaten.  It is useless 
		to resist.  Don't let yourself 
		be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so 
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks 
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at 
him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick 
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins 
to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, 
Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his 
hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his 
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its 
extreme end.  Vader
follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to 
go.  

				VADER
		There is no escape.  Don't make 
		me destroy you.  You do not yet 
		realize your importance.  You 
		have only begun to discover your 
		power.  Join me and I will complete 
		your training.  With our combined 
		strength, we can end this destructive 
		conflict and bring order to the 
		galaxy.

				LUKE
		I'll never join you!

				VADER
		If you only knew the power of the 
		dark side.  Obi-Wan never told 
		you what happened to your father.

				LUKE
		He told me enough!  It was you 
		who killed him.

				VADER
		No.  I am your father.

Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

				LUKE
		No.  No.  That's not true!  
		That's impossible!

				VADER
		Search your feelings.  You know 
		it to be true.

				LUKE
		No!  No!  No!

				VADER
		Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
		He has foreseen this.  It is your 
		destiny.  Join me, and together 
		we can rule the galaxy as father 
		and son.  Come with me.  It is the 
		only way.

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.

A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant 
he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over 
the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow 
at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the 
edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, 
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.

INT. REACTOR SHAFT

Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE

Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet 
hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of 
the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK

Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the 
undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to 
grab onto on electronic weather vane.

				LUKE
		Ben... Ben, please!

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the 
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust 
pipe.

				LUKE
		Ben.  Leia!

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.

				LUKE
		Hear me!  Leia!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is 
busy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a 
readout on the control panel.

				LEIA
		Luke... We've got to go back.

Chewie growls in surprise.

				LANDO
		What?

				LEIA
		I know where Luke is.

				LANDO
		But what about those fighter?

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

				LEIA
		Chewie, just do it.

				LANDO
		But what about Vader?

Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

				LANDO
		All right, all right, all right.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK

The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the 
Falcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing 
platform.

				VADER
		Bring my shuttle.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his 
body shifts in the wind.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE 
fighter close in on the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Leia tries to remain calm.

				LANDO
			(pointing out the 
			 cockpit window)
		Look, someone's up there.

				LEIA
		It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
		Slow down and we'll get under him.
		Lando, open the top hatch.

Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips 
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks 
toward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up 
through the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally 
falls from the vane into space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the 
city.  The ship gains on him.

				LEIA
		Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

The Falcon closes in on Luke.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH

The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help 
the battered warrior inside the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia 
and Chewie struggle with the controls.

				LEIA
			(into intercom)
		Lando?

				LANDO
			(over intercom)
		Okay, let's go.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, 
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.  
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the 
cockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie 
barks in joyous relief.

				LUKE
		Oh, Leia.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY

The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from 
the cloud-covered city.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.  
Leia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.

				LEIA
		I'll be back.

She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches 
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some 
switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing 
on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the 
shape.

				LEIA
		Star Destroyer.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Ready for 
		light-speed.

				LEIA
		If your people fixed the 
		hyperdrive.

Another explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the 
panel next to her flashes on.

				LEIA
		All the coordinates are set.
		It's now or never.

Chewie barks in agreement.

				LANDO
		Punch it!

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The 
sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, 
expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets 
out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.

				LANDO
		They told me they fixed it.  I 
		trusted them to fix it.  It's not 
		my fault!

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives 
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

EXT. SPACE

In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting 
lasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly 
following the Falcon.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett 
approaches him.

				PIETT
		They'll be in range of our 
		tractor beam in moments, my lord.

				VADER
		Did your men deactivate the 
		hyperdrive on the Millennium 
		Falcon?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
		Good.  Prepare the boarding party 
		and set your weapons for stun.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio 
who now has one leg attached. 

Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

				THREEPIO
		Noisy brute.  Why don't we just 
		go into light-speed?

Artoo beeps in response.

				THREEPIO
		We can't?  How would you know the 
		hyperdrive is deactivated?

Artoo whistles knowingly.

				THREEPIO
		The city's central computer told 
		you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better 
		than to trust a strange computer.
		Ouch!  Pay attention to what 
		you're doing!

Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an 
enormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits 
the panel...

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly 
sprayed by a shower of sparks.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased 
by the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing 
gets slightly faster.

				VADER
		Luke.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his 
fate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.

				LUKE
		Father.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Son, come with me.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the 
ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive 
mechanism.

				LANDO
			(into intercom)
		Chewie!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE 
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost 
unconscious with pain and depression.

				LUKE
		It's Vader.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Luke... it is your destiny.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Ready for 
		the tractor beam.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.  
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, come back at once!  You 
		haven't finished with me yet!
		You don't know how to fix the 
		hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do 
		it.  I'm standing here in pieces, 
		and you're having delusions of 
		grandeur!

Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel 
lights up.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon 
unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you did it!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer 
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader 
turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back 
in a contemplative gesture.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER

The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking 
tube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel 
transport ship hovers near the fleet.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie 
busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

				LUKE
			(over comlink)
		Good luck, Lando

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		When we find Jabba the Hut and 
		that bounty hunter, we'll contact 
		you.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.  
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		I'll meet you at the rendezvous 
		point on Tatooine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		Princess, we'll find Han.  I 
		promise.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Chewie, I'll be waiting for your 
		signal.

Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Take care, you two.  May the 
		Force be with you.

Luke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been 
wrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in 
a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.

				LUKE
		Ow!

Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is 
completely functional.

He gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a 
new understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about 
his uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the 
large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star 
Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.

Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and 
Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group 
watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and 
zooms away into space.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER

While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the 
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the 
cruiser turns and moves away into space.

                                    THE FORCE AWAKENS



           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

          CUT TO BLACK.

          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

                         ARE IN:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

                         QUIET:

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

          ROLLS OFF FAST --

          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

                          POE
           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

                          POE
          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           We've got company.

          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

                          POE
           You have to hide.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

                          POE
           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

          IN THE DISTANCE.
          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

                          POE (CONT'D)
           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

                          POE
           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

                         HIM:

                          SENIOR TROOPER
           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

                          KYLO REN
           Look how old you've become.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

                          KYLO REN
           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

                          KYLO REN
           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

                          KYLO REN
           I'll show you the dark side.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

          YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

                          KYLO REN
           You're so right.
          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

                          POE
           So who talks first? You talk first?

                          KYLO REN
           The old man gave it to you.

                          POE

                          (INDICATES KYLO'S

                          MASK)
           It's just very hard to understand
           you with all the...

                         

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          KYLO REN

                          (TO TROOPERS)
           Search him.

                          POE
           ... Apparatus.
          The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
          brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
          Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

                          STORMTROOPER #1
           Nothing, sir.

                          KYLO REN
           Put him on board.
          Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
          Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

          CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Sir, the villagers.

                          KYLO REN
           Kill them all.
          Phasma nods, steps forward:

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           On my command!
          The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

           CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
           Fire!
          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

                         BACKS AWAY:

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          STORMTROOPER #2
           Nothing here. Go ahead!
          Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
          destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
          and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
          hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

                          POE
           All right. All right!
          Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
          helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
          knows he's in trouble.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
           inspection.

                          FN-2187
           Yes, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           And who gave you permission to remove
           that helmet?

                          FN-2187
           I'm sorry, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Report to my division at once.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

          SPACESHIPS.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
          her speeder toward the town.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

                          UNKAR
           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)
          CONTINUED: just 'cause.
          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

                          REY
           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

                          REY (CONT'D)

           NOMA.
          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           That's just Teedo. Wants you for
           parts. He has no respect for anyone.
           Your antenna's bent.
           (considers BB-8 for
           the first time,

                          STRAIGHTENS THE

                          ANTENNA)
           Where do you come from?

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Classified. Really? Me too. Big
           secret.
           (points to horizon)
           Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
           Kelvin Ridge.

                         CONTINUED:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
           the north, you'll drown in the sand.
           (stands, heads off)

                         
          BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.

                         

                         

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Don't follow me. Town is that way.
           (he BEEPS again)
           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           In the morning, you go.

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You're welcome.
          The two disappear behind a dune.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

          POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

                          KYLO REN
           I had no idea we had the best pilot
           in the Resistance on board.
           Comfortable?
          Through battered lips:

                          POE
           Not really.

                          KYLO REN
           I'm impressed. No one has been able
           to get out of you what you did with
           the map.

                          POE
           Might wanna rethink your technique.
          Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
          the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
          him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

                          KYLO REN
           Where is it?

          Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

          WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
          confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

                          KYLO REN
           It's in a droid. A BB unit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
           soon have it.

                          KYLO REN
           I leave that to you.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

                          REY
           Don't give up. He still might show
           up. Whoever it is you're waiting
           for. Classified. I know all about
           waiting.
          BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           For my family. They'll be back.
           One day. Come on.
          She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
          off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
          He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

                          UNKAR
           These five pieces are worth... Let
           me see here... One half portion.

                          REY

                          (OBJECTS)
           Last week they were a half portion
           each.
          She hates him. He leans forward.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                          REY
           What about him?

                          UNKAR
           I'll pay for him.
          BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

                          UNKAR (CONT'D)
           Sixty portions.
          CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
          food, her stomach practically rumbles.
          BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
          conversation at all.
          She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
          Finally, she hears herself say:

                          REY
           Actually... the droid's not for sale.

                          (TO BB-8)
           Come on.
          Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
          watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

                          UNKAR
           Follow the girl and get that droid.
          He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

          An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by

           This is a rescue, I'm helping you

           Because it's the right thing to do.

                          POE
           (it hits him)
           You need a pilot.

                          FN-2187
           I need a pilot.
          And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.

                          POE
           We're gonna do this.

                          FN-2187

          FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back

          INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY


                          POE
           I got it!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

                          POE
           Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
           All right, we gotta take out as many
           cannons as we can or we're not gonna
           get very far!

                          FN-2187
           All right!

                          POE
           I'm gonna get us in position, just
           stay sharp!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN
          THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK,
          along the ship's belly --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe flies toward the CANONS --

                          POE
           Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?
           I've got us dead centered. It's a
           clean shot.

                          FN-2187
           Okay, got it.
          FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS
          EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris!

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          FN-2187 YELLS in celebration:

                          FN-2187
           YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE

           THAT?

                          POE
           I saw it! Hey, what's your name?

                          FN-2187

           FN-2187!
          Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.

                          POE
           FN-whaa?

                          FN-2187
           That's the only name they ever gave
           me!

                          POE
           Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
           Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
           That all right?
          Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

                          FINN
           "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that!
           I like that!

                          POE
           I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

                          FINN
           Good to meet you, Poe!

                          POE
           Good to meet you too, Finn!

          INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at
          a console.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--

                          GENERAL HUX
           Use the ventral cannons.

           Yes, sir. Bringing them online --

           KYLO REN (O.S.)
           General Hux. Is it the Resistance
           pilot?
          Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, and he had help.

                          (VEXED)
           From one of our own.
          PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says:

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           We're checking the registers now to
           identify which Stormtrooper it was.

                          KYLO REN
           ... The one from the village. FN-

           2187.
          Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
          Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Fire.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the
          TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts
          hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION.
          The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU,

          THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8.

                          POE
           That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange
           and white: one of a kind.

          Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187 reported to my division, was
           evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.

           General. They've been hit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Destroyed?

                          TECHNICIAN #1

                          (GETTING READINGS)
           Disabled. They were headed back to
           Jakku -- the fighter's projected to
           crash in the Goazon badlands.

                          GENERAL HUX
           They were going back for the droid --
           send a squad to the wreckage.

          EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
          to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
          WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
          A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
          Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
          gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

                          FINN
           Poe! Poe!
          Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
          SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
          sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
          He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
          to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Poe!!! POE!
          Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

                          FINN (CONT'D)

           POE!!! POE!!!
          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
           Capture the droid if we can, but
           destroy it if we must.

                          KYLO REN
           How capable are your soldiers,
           General?

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (WITH VITRIOL)
           I won't have you question my methods.

                          KYLO REN
           They're obviously skilled at
           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
           My men are exceptionally trained --
           programmed from birth--

                          KYLO REN
           Then they should have no problem
           retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Careful, Ren. That your "personal
           interests" not interfere with orders
           from Leader Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           I want that map. For your sake, I
           suggest you get it.
          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

                          FINN
           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

          BEEPING BB-8.
          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

                          REY
           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

                          REY
           What's your hurry, thief?

                          FINN
           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           OW! HEY! What?!

                          REY
           The jacket! This droid says you
           stole it!

                          FINN
           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

                          AGAIN)

           STOP IT!

                          REY
           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

                          FINN
           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

                          (RELIVING IT)
           Poe didn't make it.
           (sees BB-8 is sad,

                          ROLLS OFF)
           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

                          REY
           So you're with the Resistance?

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

                          FINN
           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

                          (WHISPERS)
           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

                          REY
           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

                          FINN
           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

                          REY
           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

                          FINN
           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

                          REY
           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           (re: her hand)
           What are you doing?!

                          FINN
           Come on!
          Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
          SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
          a maze of tents:

           Come on, BB-8!

                          REY
           Let go of me!

                          FINN
           No, we gotta move!

                          REY
           (pulls her hand back)
           I know how to run without you holding
           my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Call in the air strike!
          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

          INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
          Quiet, urgent:

                          REY
           They're shooting at both of us!

                          FINN
           Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
           marked!

                          REY
           Well, thanks for that!

                          FINN
           I'm not the one who chased you down
           with a stick! Does anyone have
           blasters around here?!

                          REY

                          (TO BB-8)
           Are you okay?
          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Stop taking my hand!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
          As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

          FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

          FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

          BB-8 ROLLING!

                         

                         
          WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
          EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

                          REY
           Hey!
          As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

                          FINN
           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her
          life been asked it.

                          REY
           Yeah.
           (extends her hand)
           Follow me.
          Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
          LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

          8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
          and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
          TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

                          FINN
           We can't outrun them!
          Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

                          REY
           We might in that quad-jumper!

                          FINN
           We need a pilot!

                          REY
           We've got one!

           (then, indicates one

                          OFF-CAMERA)
           What about that ship?

                          REY
           That one's garbage!
          They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
          IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
          quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           The garbage'll do!
          She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
          run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
          the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
          the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

                          REY
           Gunner position's down there!

                          FINN

                          (CLIMBS DOWN)
           Y'ever fly this thing?

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
          frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
          ENGINES WHINE to life:

                          REY
           No! This ship hasn't been flown in
           years!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
          WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
          steady himself.

                          FINN
           Great.
           (reacts to seat)
           Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words:

          Rey pulls the yoke:

          THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP

          SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY!
          From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS:

                          UNKAR

           HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
          The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Rey pilots, headed for the sky!
          Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.

                          FINN
           Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay
           low!

                          REY

           WHAT?

                          FINN
           Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
          For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to
          the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!

                          REY
           BB-8, hold on!
          Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,
          stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.

                          REY

           I'M GOING LOW!!!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC,
          UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand.
          Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING!
          Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They
          are ROCKED BY A BLAST!

          Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:

                          FINN
           I'm working on it! Are the shields
           up?
          Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.

                          REY
           Not so easy without a co-pilot!
          Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:

                          FINN
           Try sitting in this thing!
          Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and
          SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING!

          INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

          The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST!

                          (TO HERSELF)
           I hope.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK,
          TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING!
          The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE
          IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor.

          Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS
          instantly there to consume the new bounty.
          The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms
          through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she
          goes, pieces flying.
          The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET,

          SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION!

          The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
          scans the area -- and gets an idea.

                          REY
           Get ready!

          Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER

          Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space
          in the wreck.

          The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
          Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
          FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

          DESTROYING IT!
          REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY
          as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!

                          FINN
           Whooo!
          The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard

          BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
          HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

                          FINN
           Rey...
          But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
          STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

                          REY
           Help me with this! Quick!
          They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
          over, watches.

                          FINN
           Whoa! What's going on?
          She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
          star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.

           Sir. We were unable to acquire the
           droid on Jakku.
          Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           It escaped capture aboard a stolen
           Corellian YT model freighter.

                          KYLO REN
           The droid... stole a freighter?

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Not exactly, sir. It had help.
          Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           We have no confirmation, but we
           believe FN-2187 may have been helped
           in the escape--
          Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
          BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
          The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
          looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
          scars.

                          KYLO REN
           Anything else?
          Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           The two were accompanied by a girl.
          Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
          REN, into his black glove:

                          KYLO REN
           What girl?

                          REY
           BB-8 said the location of the
           Resistance Base is "need to know" --

           This?
          She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
          alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
          moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You gotta tell us where the base is.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I don't speak that. Alright, between
           us, I'm not with the Resistance,
           okay?
           (BB-8 backs up)
           -- I'm just trying to get away from
           the First Order -- but you tell us
           where your base is, I'll get there
           first -- deal?!
           (BB-8 COCKS his head)
           Droid, please.
          Rey pops up again:

                          REY
           Pilex driver, hurry!
          Finn moves for the tool.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           So where's your base?

                          FINN

          She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
          situation, then BEEPS.

           Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's

          A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
          his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.

                          REY

          Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool.
          He throws her the tape, she disappears below:

          Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
          off one way, Han in another.
          The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
          up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.

           Who stole it from me! Well, you
           tell him Han Solo just stole back
           the Millennium Falcon for good.
          Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
          see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.

                          HAN
           Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
          Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten

                          LOOSE--
          Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
          BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:

                          FINN
           Wait -- a what?! Did you just say
           Rathtars? Hey!

          INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

          The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han
          moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him.

                          FINN
           You're not hauling Rathtars on this
           freighter, are you?

                          HAN
           I'm hauling Rathtars.
          On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE
          SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is
          LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Oh great. It's the Guavian Death
           Gang -- they must've tracked us from
           Nantoon.
          Han heads off as:

                          REY
           What's a Rathtar?

          INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY

          Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo
          containers.

                         CONTINUED: HAN
           They're big and dangerous...

                          FINN
           Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!

                          REY
           No.

                          FINN
           Good.
          They turn a corner:

                          HAN
           I got three of 'em going to King
           Prana.

                          FINN
           THREE?! How'd you get them on board?

                          HAN
           I used to have a bigger crew.
          Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.

          CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND

          CO. ARE THERE.

                          HAN
           Get below deck and stay there until
           I say so -- don't even think about
           taking the Falcon.

                          REY
           What about BB-8?

                          HAN
           He stays with me -- until I get rid
           of the gang, then you can have him
           back and be on your way.

                          FINN
           What about the Rathtars... where are
           you keeping them?
          A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS
          into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart
          stops.

                          HAN
           There's one.

                          REY
           What are you gonna do?

                          HAN
           Same thing I always do: talk my way
           out of it.

                          (CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
           Yes, I do. Every time.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY

          A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in
          a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass
          UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop
          at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet
          away in the middle of the long hall.

                          BALA-TIK
           Han Solo. You are a dead man.
          Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back
          and forth at the gang, and Han.

                          HAN
           Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

                          BALA-TIK
           The problem is we loaned you fifty
           thousand for this job.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

          They look up, trying to get a view.

                          REY
           Can you see them?

                          FINN
           No.
          They start crawling down the crawl space.

                          BALA-TIK
           I heard you also borrowed fifty
           thousand from Kanjiklub.

                          HAN
           You know you can't trust those little
           freaks! How long've we known each
           other?
          Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:

                          REY
           They have blasters...

                          FINN
           A lot of 'em.
          We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company
          in the distance.

                          BALA-TIK
           The question is how much longer will
           we know each other? Not long. We
           want our money back now.

                          HAN
           Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
           I spent that money.

                          BALA-TIK
           Kanjiklub wants their investment
           back, too.

                          HAN
           I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

                          BALA-TIK
           Tell that to Kanjiklub.
          The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he
          turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB
          MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
          Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its
          LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

                          HAN
           Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
          Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

                          TASU LEECH
           Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
           you.
          Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
          Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
          CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

                          HAN
           Boys. You're both gonna get
           what I promised! Have I ever
           not delivered for you before?

                          BALA-TIK
           Yeah.

                          TASU LEECH
           Twice!
          Han realizes he's right.

                          HAN
           What was the second time?

                          BALA-TIK
           Your game is old. There's no one in
           the galaxy left for you to swindle.

                          TASU LEECH
           Nowhere left for you to hide.

           That BB unit... the First Order is
           looking for one just like it. And
           two fugitives.
          Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
          BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
          Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

                          HAN
           First I've heard of it.
          Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
          Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

                          RAZOO QIN-FEE
           Search the freighter.
          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
          AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
          FAST in the opposite direction they came.
          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
          a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

                          REY
           Wait wait wait wait. If we close
           the blast doors in that corridor, we
           can trap both gangs!

                          FINN
           Close the blast doors from here?

                          REY
           Resetting the fuses should do it.
          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
          they do. Finn quickly joins in.
          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
          GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

          SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
          The GANGS look around.
          Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

                          HAN
           ... I got a bad feeling about this...
          Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,
          where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.

                          REY
           Oh no.

                          FINN
           Oh no, what?

                          REY

                          (PALE)
           Wrong fuses.

          IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:

                          BALA-TIK
           Kill them! And take the droid!
          The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND

          THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS
          SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!
          Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as
          a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The
          Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE
          KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him
          with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep
          steppin....

          INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

          Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.

                          FINN
           This was a mistake!

                          REY
           Huge!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
          Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
          corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
          help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
          distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
          Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
          they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
          TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
          land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
          quickly.

                         
          They turn a corridor --

                          REY
           What do they look like?

                          FINN
           They look like that.
          Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a

          RATHTAR IS THERE!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           This way!

                          REY

          They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY

          FAST!

                          REY (CONT'D)

           FINN!
          But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --

           REY!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING
          as he struggles to get loose!
          Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen.

                          REY

           FINN!!!!
          Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
          realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
          up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
          and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
          BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

          SLAMS THE BUTTON!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY

          The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S
          TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL
          WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
          shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
          Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
          adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

                          REY
           Finn!

          ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE
          with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

                          HAN
           I got the door. Cover us!
          Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han
          CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie
          exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
          THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
          IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

          LOUD GROAN!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Chewie! You okay?
          Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,

          BADASS!

           Wow. Come on! Come on!

          INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY

          Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
          the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them.

                          REY
           Han!
          Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
          says to Rey:

                          HAN
           You, close the door behind us!

                          (TO FINN)
           You take care of Chewie!
          Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
          who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
          fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

           Hey, where are you going?

           I hate that guy.
          Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

                          REY
           And you could use a co-pilot.

                          HAN
           I got one, he's back there.

          Han and Rey in the seats:

           From inside the hangar? Is that
           even possible?

                          HAN
           I never ask that question until after
           I've done it.
          A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
          GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           This is not how I thought this day
           was gonna go -- angle the shields --

          IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a

          The ship is hit.

          He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What?!
          But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.

                          REY
           Compressor.
          Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
          again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
          LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
          BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
          as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

          EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving
          the cargo ship behind.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,
          SEETHING. Makes a CALL:

                          BALA-TIK
           Inform the First Order that Han Solo
           has the droid they want. And it's
           aboard the Millennium Falcon.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
          frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
          that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
          Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
          very much in control, of power:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           The droid will soon be delivered to
           the Resistance...

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
          someone addressing them.
          We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                          SNOKE
           ... Leading them to the last Jedi.
           If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
           will rise.

           General! Our strategy must now
           change.

                          GENERAL HUX
           The weapon. It is ready. I believe
           the time has come to use it. We
           shall destroy the government that
           supports the Resistance, the Republic.
           Without their friends to protect
           them, the Resistance will be
           vulnerable, and we will stop them
           before they reach Skywalker.
          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

                          SNOKE
           Go. Oversee preparations.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, Supreme Leader.
          General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
          go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

                          SNOKE
           There's been an awakening. Have you
           felt it?

                          KYLO REN
           Yes.

                          SNOKE
           There's something more. The droid
           we seek is aboard the Millennium
           Falcon. In the hands of your father,
           Han Solo.
          Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

                          KYLO REN
           He means nothing to me.

                          SNOKE
           Even you, master of the Knights of
           Ren, have never faced such a test.

           By the grace of your training, I
           will not be seduced.

                          SNOKE
           We shall see. We shall see.
          A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
          filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
          evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
          a HOLOGRAM all along.

          EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

          RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot,
          ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where
          CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER.

          SPARKS!

                          HAN
           Electrical overload!

                          REY
           I can fix that!

                          HAN

          INT. LOUNGE:

          CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage
          on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off.

                          FINN
           Chewie, come on! I need help with
           this giant hairy thing! Stop moving!
           Chewie!

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal
           with me!

          INT. LOUNGE:

                          FINN
           Hurt him?! He almost killed me six
           times!
           (Chewie GRABS HIM by
           the collar, ROARS)
           Which is fine.

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           This hyperdrive blows there's gonna
           be pieces of us in three different
           systems.
          Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,
          sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What'd you do?

                          REY
           I by-passed the compressor.
          He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits,
          walking past BB-8.

                          HAN
           Move, Ball.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

          Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
          checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.

                          HAN
           Nah, don't say that, you did great.
           Just rest.
          Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
          him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Good job, kid. And thanks.

                          FINN
           You're welcome.
          Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
          PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
          start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
          turn it off.

                          HAN
           So, fugitives, huh?

                          REY

           ... I'm just a scavenger.
          Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
          to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

                          HAN

          BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

          MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
          They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
          stars, becomes reflective.

                          HAN
           This map's not complete. It's just
           a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
           people have been looking for him.

                          REY
           Why'd he leave?

                          HAN
           He was training a new generation of
           Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
           against him, destroyed it all. Luke
           felt responsible... He walked away
           from everything.

                          FINN
           Do you know what happened to him?

                          HAN
           There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
           The people who knew him the best
           think he went looking for the first
           Jedi temple.

                          REY
           The Jedi were real?

                          HAN
           I used to wonder that myself. Thought
           it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
           magical power holding together good,
           evil, the dark side and the light.

          An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle
          some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
          and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

                         DOWN:

          The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a

                          HAN
           Rey. I've been thinkin' about
           bringing on some more crew, Rey. A
           second mate. Someone to help out.
           Someone who can keep up with Chewie
           and me, appreciates the Falcon.

           Are you offering me a job?

                          HAN
           I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't
           pay much.

                          REY
           You're offering me a job.

                          HAN
           I'm thinking about it.
          Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she
          can't cross.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Well?

                          REY
           If you were, I'd be flattered. But
           I have to get home.
          Han looks at her, questioningly.

                          HAN
           Jakku?
          Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.

                          REY

                          (BEAT)
           I've already been away too long.

                          HAN

                          (TO CHEWIE)
           Chewie, check out the ship as best
           you can.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes
           you.
          Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Han walks them to the castle.

                          FINN
           Solo, why are we here again?

                          HAN
           To get your droid on a clean ship.

                          REY
           Clean?

           Do you think it was luck that Chewie
           and I found the Falcon? If we can
           find it on our scanners, the First
           Order's not far behind. Want to get
           BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata
           is our best bet.

                          FINN
           We can trust her, right?

                          HAN
           Relax, kid. She's run this watering
           hole for a thousand years. Maz is a
           bit of an acquired taste, so let me
           do the talking. And whatever you
           do, don't stare...

           REY AND FINN
           At what?

                          HAN
           Any of it.
          The door opens. Music. Madness. And...

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

          We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
          room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
          drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
          BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
          suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
          TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.
          This is MAZ KANATA.

                          MAZ
           Han Solo!
          Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.

                          HAN
           (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)
           Hey, Maz!
          NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.

                          MAZ
           Where's my boyfriend?

                          HAN
           Chewie's working on the Falcon.

                          MAZ
           I like that Wookiee. I assume you
           need something. Desperately. Let's
           get to it.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey
          are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do --
          passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE
          NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
          A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8
          following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a
          small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.

                          GA-97
           Alert the Resistance. Their missing
           droid is here!
          And we CUT TO:

          IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
          Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
          communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:

                          BAZINE
           Inform the First Order... I've found
           the droid.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

          A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone
          OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.

                          KYLO REN
           Forgive me. I feel it again. The
           pull to the light. Supreme Leader
           senses it. Show me again, the power
           of the darkness, and I will let
           nothing stand in our way. Show me,
           Grandfather, and I will finish what
           you started.
          As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW
          HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,

          ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY

          Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:

                          MAZ
           A map to Skywalker himself? You're
           right back in the mess.

                          HAN
           Maz, I need you to get this droid to
           Leia.

           Hmm. No. You've been running away
           from this fight for too long. Han,
           nyakee nago wadda. Go home!

                          HAN
           Leia doesn't want to see me.

                          FINN
           Please, we came here for your help.

                          REY
           What fight?

                          MAZ
           The only fight: against the dark
           side. Through the ages, I've seen
           evil take many forms. The Sith.
           The Empire. Today, it is the First
           Order. Their shadow is spreading
           across the galaxy. We must face
           them. Fight them. All of us.

                          FINN
           There is no fight against the First
           Order! Not one we can win. Look
           around. There's no chance we haven't
           been recognized already. I bet you
           the First Order is on their way right--
          Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
          him -- her eyes get HUGE.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           What's this? What are you doing?
          Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
          BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
          Finn.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Solo, what is she doing?

                          HAN
           I don't know, but it ain't good.

                          MAZ
           If you live long enough you see the
           same eyes in different people. I'm
           looking at the eyes of a man who
           wants to run.

                          FINN
           (eyes on Maz)
           You don't know a thing about me.
           Where I'm from. What I've seen.

           You don't know the First Order like
           I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
           need to run.
          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
          chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

                          MAZ
           You see those two? They'll trade
           work for transportation to the Outer
           Rim. There, you can disappear.
          Finn sees them. Considers.

                          REY
           Finn!

                          FINN

                          REY
           What about BB-8? We're not done
           yet. We have to get him back to
           your base.

                          FINN
           I can't.
          Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

                          HAN
           Keep it, kid.
          Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
          back to normal, and turns to Han.

                          MAZ
           Who's the girl?

                         ON FINN
          Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

                          FINN
           I was told you could get me to the
           Outer Rim.
          Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

                          REY
           What are you doing?
          Finn gets up to talk to her.

                          FINN
           (to Big Head)
           Don't leave without me.

           You can't just go. I won't let you.

                          FINN
           I'm not who you think I am.

                          REY
           Finn, what are you talking about?

                          FINN
           I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
           I'm a Stormtrooper.

                          (STOPS HER)
           Like all of them, I was taken from a
           family I'll never know. And raised
           to do one thing...

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           But my first battle, I made a choice.
           I wasn't going to kill for them. So
           I ran.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Right into you. And you looked at
           me like no one ever had. I was
           ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
           with the First Order. I'm never
           going back. Rey, come with me.

                          REY
           Don't go.

                          FINN
           Take care of yourself. Please.
          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

          DOOR OPENS.
          Hesitant, Rey enters.

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

                          YOUNG GIRL

           NO!
          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

                          YOUNG GIRL
           No, come back!

           Quiet, girl!
          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

                          REY
           What was that? I shouldn't have
           gone in there.

                          MAZ
           That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
           father's before him and now, it calls
           to you!
          Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

                          REY
           I have to get back to Jakku.

                          MAZ
           Han told me.
           (reaches out, hold

                          REY'S HAND)
           Dear child. I see your eyes. You
           already know the truth. Whomever
           you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
           never coming back. But... there's
           someone who still could.

                          REY
           Luke.

                          MAZ
           The belonging you seek is not behind
           you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
           but I know the Force. It moves
           through and surrounds every living
           thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

                         CONTINUED:

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           The light. It's always been there.
           It will guide you. The saber. Take
           it.
          Rey suddenly stands.

                          REY
           I'm never touching that again. I
           don't want any part of this.
          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
          Heads toward the woods.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

                          GENERAL HUX
           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to
           the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
           All remaining systems will bow to
           the First Order! And will remember
           this... as the last day of the
           Republic!

                         

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
          nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


                          GENERAL HUX

           FIRE!
          And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
          THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

          At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

          SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

          FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

          EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
          structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
          FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

          APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
          NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

          ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           FINN (O.S.)
           It was the Republic.
          Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
          the crowd. With dread:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           The First Order, they've done it.
           Where's Rey?

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

                          REY
           What are you doing?

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You have to go back.
           (he BEEPS again)

                          REY (CONT'D)
           BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
           go back, you're too important.
           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

          FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

                          MAZ
           I've had this for ages...

          MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
          Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Kept it locked away.

                          HAN
           Where'd you get that?

                          MAZ
           A good question for another time.

                          (TO FINN)
           Take it! Find your friend!
          Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           Those beasts! They're here!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
          SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

                          STORMTROOPER
           FN-417, hold position!
          Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
          She panics, then realizes:

                          REY
           Safety!
          SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
          and retreats, calls to BB-8:
          BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
          chasing Troopers!

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

                          STORMTROOPER #4
           Sir, the droid was spotted heading
           west, with a girl.
          Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

                          REY
           You have to keep going, stay out of
           sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
           (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
           through her fear)
           I hope so, too.
          BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
          a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
          debris.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          HAN
           Come on, Chewie!
          Maz turns to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
           go.

                          FINN
           I need a weapon.
          Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

                          MAZ
           You have one!
          He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
          lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
          HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
          Stormtroopers, taking some out!

                          HAN
           Hey, can I try that?
          Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
          and sends them flying.

                          HAN (CONT'D)

                          (TO CHEWBACCA)
           I like this thing.
          FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
          another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
          Stormtrooper has a MACE --

                          STORMTROOPER
           Traitor!
          FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
          KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
          when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
          Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
          Han helps him up.

                          HAN
           You okay, Big deal?

                         

                          FINN
           Thanks!
          But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Don't move! TK-338, we have targets
           in custody!

          No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER
          as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up.
          Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
          Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
          a transport, hands on their heads.
          But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
          turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

          WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE

          FIRST ORDER SHIPS!

          PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS.

           It's the Resistance.
          One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN

           We're with you, Poe!
          The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
          in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

          UP.

                          HAN
           Quick!
          Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots
          a Trooper.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
          aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
          And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
          again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

          DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
          She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
          rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

                          KYLO REN
           The girl I've heard so much about.
          He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           The droid.
          He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

          HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           Where is it?

          WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

          ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

           Request air support!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
          TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
          a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
          She is relieved but still afraid.

                          KYLO REN
           The map. You've seen it.
          Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
          stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
          She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
          Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
          EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

                          STORMTROOPER #5
           Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
           more troops.
          Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.

           Pull the division out. Forget the
           droid. We have what we need.
          A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS

          FROM FRAME!

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING
          another TIE Fighter! On the ground:

                          STORMTROOPER
           Pull back the tree line!
          Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
          FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
          breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
          IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
          Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
          Han is ROCKED.

                          FINN

           NO!! REY!!!
          Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
          AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

          CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, no... REY!!
          In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
          receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
          ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

          BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

                          FINN
           He took her! Did you see that? He
           took her. She's gone!

                          HAN

                          (WALKS PAST)
           Yeah, yeah, I know...
          And he and Chewie head off.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
          BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

                          C-3PO
           Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
           Threepio!
           (sees Han, stops)
           You probably don't recognize me
           because of the red arm.
           (sees Leia,

                          INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
           Look who it is! Did you see who?
           Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
           Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Yes, I must get my proper arm
           reinstalled.
          He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

                          HAN
           You changed your hair.

                          LEIA
           Same jacket.

                          HAN
           No, new jacket.
          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
           He was here.
          Leia hears this.
          Maz watches through the smoke.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
          trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
          to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
          a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
          Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
          searching.
          Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
          Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
          THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

          IT IS POE!
          Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
          WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
          droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
          believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
          distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

                          FINN
           Poe. Poe Dameron.
          They move to each other -- and embrace.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You're alive!

                          POE
           So are you!

                          FINN
           What happened to you?

                          POE
           What happened? I got thrown from
           the crash, woke up at night -- no
           you, no ship, nothing--
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           BB-8 says that you saved him.

                          FINN
           No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

                          POE
           You completed my mission, Finn.
           That's my jacket?

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
          command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
          arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
          Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:

                          POE
           General Organa. Sorry to interrupt,
           this is Finn, he needs to talk to

                          LEIA
           (takes Finn's hand)
           And I need to talk to him. That was
           incredibly brave, what you did.
           Renouncing the First Order, saving
           this man's life --

                          FINN
           (surprised she knows)
           Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of
           mine was taken prisoner--

                          LEIA
           Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
          Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

                          POE
           Finn's familiar with the weapon that
           destroyed the Hosnian system. He
           worked on the base.

                          LEIA
           We're desperate for anything you can
           tell us.

                          FINN
           That's where my friend was taken --
           I've got to get there, fast.

                          LEIA
           And I will do everything I can to
           help, but first you must tell us all

          enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
          HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

                          C-3PO
           General, I regret to inform you, but
           this map recovered from BB-8 is only
           partially complete. And even worse,
           it matches no charted system on
           record. We simply do not have enough
           information to locate Master Luke.

                          LEIA
           I can't believe I was so foolish to
           think that I could just find Luke
           and bring him home.

                          HAN
           Leia...

                          LEIA
           Don't do that.

                          HAN
           Do what?
           She heads off.

                          LEIA
           Anything.
           Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

          LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
          dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
          the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
          RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
          R2. Nothing. Then:

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           BB-8. You're wasting your time.
          BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           It is very doubtful that R2 would
           have the rest of the map in his backup
           data.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
           low power mode ever since Master
           Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
           be his old self again.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

                          HAN
           Listen to me, will you? I know every
           time you... every time you look at
           me, you're reminded of him.

                          LEIA
           You think I want to forget him? I
           want him back!
          Han looks at her with sympathy.

                          HAN
           There was nothing we could've done.
           (hard for him to say)
           There was too much Vader in him.

                          LEIA
           That's why I wanted him to train
           with Luke. I just never should have
           sent him away. That's when I lost
           him. That's when I lost you both.

           We both had to deal with it in our
           own way. I went back to the only
           thing I was ever good at.

                          LEIA
           We both did.

                          HAN
           We lost our son, forever.

                          LEIA
           No.

                          (LONG BEAT)
           It was Snoke.
          Han takes this in.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           He seduced our son to the dark side.
           But we can still save him. Me.
           You.

           Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.

          Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
          restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
          in place, standing there.

                          REY
           Where am I?

                          KYLO REN

           You're my guest.

                          REY
           Where are the others?

                          KYLO REN
           You mean the murderers, traitors and
           thieves you call friends?
           (Rey stares at him)
           You'll be relieved to hear that I
           have no idea.

          Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You still want to kill me.

                          REY
           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

                          KYLO REN
           Tell me about the droid.

                          REY
           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

                          KYLO REN
           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
           leave...
           (then, slight smile)
           At night, desperate to sleep... you
           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
           the island...
          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           And Han Solo. You feel like he's
           the father you never had. He would've
           disappointed you.

                         CONTINUED:
          His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

                          REY
           -- Get out of my head --
          But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

                          KYLO REN
           I know you've seen the map. It's in
           there... and now you'll give it to
           me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
           too.
          Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

                          REY
           I'm not giving you anything.

                          KYLO REN
           We'll see.
          He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

          AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

                          REY
           ... You... you're afraid... that you
           will never be as strong as... Darth
           Vader!
          KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
          FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
          Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
          And we PRELAP:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           This scavenger, resisted you?

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           She's strong with the Force, untrained
           but, stronger than she knows.
          And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

                          SNOKE
           And the droid?

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

           GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
           Ren believed it was no longer valuable
           to us.
          Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
          platform beside Ren.

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           That the girl was all we needed. As
           a result, the droid has most likely
           been returned to the hands of the
           enemy. They may have the map already.
          Snoke is visibly furious.

                          SNOKE
           Then the Resistance must be destroyed
           before they get to Skywalker.

                          GENERAL HUX
           We have their location. We tracked
           their reconnaissance ship to the
           Ileenium system.

                          SNOKE
           Good. Then we will crush them once
           and for all. Prepare the weapon.
          Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
          at all --

                          KYLO REN
           Supreme Leader. I can get the map
           from the girl. I just need your
           guidance.

                          SNOKE
           If what you say about this girl is
           true, bring her to me.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.

           What did you say?
          Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
          confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
          Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
          laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I'll tighten those restraints,
           scavenger scum!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

          LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
          tries again.

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I will remove these restraints. And
           leave this cell, with the door open.
          He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
          AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
          IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

                          REY
           And you will drop your weapon.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           And I'll drop my weapon.
          The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
          Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

          LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
          REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in
          the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS

          HAPPENED.

          WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
          the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces
          of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
          Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
          TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.

          Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside.

           Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

          A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY
          surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER.
          MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT
          REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL
          LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN
          to the Starkiller Base planet.

          Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is
          huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays
          a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF
          STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO,
          Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,

           They've somehow created a hyper
           lightspeed weapon built within the
           planet itself.

                          BRANCE
           A laser cannon?

           This was the Death Star.
          Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
          SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER

          BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE
          PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
          comparison.

           This is Starkiller Base.

                          ADMIRAL ACKBAR
           How is it possible to power a weapon
           of this size?

                          FINN
           It uses the power of the sun. As
           the weapon is charged, the sun is
           drained until it disappears.
          An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

                          LEIA
           (eyes on datacard)
           The First Order: they're charging
           the weapon again, now.
           (then, heart sinking)
           Our system is the next target.

                          C-3PO
           Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
           we're doomed.
          They all react to this horrible news.

                          HAN
           Okay, how do we blow it up?
           (all eyes on him)
           There's always a way to do that.

           In order for that amount of power to

           some kind of thermal oscillator...

                          FINN
           There is one.
          All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location

           If we can destroy that oscillator,
           it might de-stabilize the core and
           cripple the weapon.

                          MAJOR EMATT

          A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the

          He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE

          Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a
          corner, wary.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

          A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
          Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
          infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

          WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off

          she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

                          REY
           (shrugs, smiles, though
           nearly in tears)
           ... That it was your idea.
          Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

                          FINN
           How did you get away?

                          REY
           I can't explain it. And you wouldn't
           believe it.

                          HAN
           Escape now. Hug later.

          The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of
          the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past
          each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First
          Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close-

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the
          TIE Fighters and missiles.
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out
          here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the
          lop-sided battle.

          THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES.
          A long moment of communication.

                          HAN
           They're in trouble. We can't leave.
           (to Finn, re: Chewie)
           My friend here has a bag full of
           explosives. Let's use 'em.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:

           KAYDEL KO CONNIX
           General, are you seeing this?

                          VOBER DAND
           Two more X-wings down. That's half
           our fleet destroyed.

                          C-3PO
           And their weapon will be fully charged
           in 10 minutes! It would take a
           miracle to save us now.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
          STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly,
          Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and
          the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.

          ALARMS START BLARING!

          INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

          Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service
          hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics
          of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of
          Rey.
          And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout,
          step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.

                          HAN
           That girl knows her stuff.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones.

                          HAN
           We'll set the charges at every other
           column.
          He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           You're right. That's a better idea.
           (checks his detonator)
           You take the top.

                          (CHEWIE DOES)
           I'll go down below. Detonator.
           We'll meet back here.
          They head off in opposite directions.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
          and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
          CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
          Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
          CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
          SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

                          KYLO REN
           Find them.
          They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
          carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
          They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
          CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
          shadows of the grillwork.

          Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
          and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

          GONE.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

          Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
          he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
          demeanor changes --
          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

                          HAN
           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
          catwalk. He turns.

                          KYLO REN
           Han Solo. I've been waiting for
           this day for a long time.
          Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
          that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
          a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
          and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
          the catwalk below.

                          HAN
           Take off that mask. You don't need
           it.

                          KYLO REN
           What do you think you'll see if I
           do?
          Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

                          HAN
           The face of my son.
          Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
          of his son for the first time as a man.

                          KYLO REN
           Your son is gone. He was weak and
           foolish, like his father. So I
           destroyed him.

                          HAN
           That's what Snoke wants you to believe
           but it's not true. My son is alive.
          SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

          Kylo flares.

                          KYLO REN
           No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

                          HAN
           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

                          KYLO REN
           It's too late.

                          HAN
           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

                          KYLO REN
           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

                          KYLO REN
           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

                          HAN
           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

          VANISHES.
          Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
          but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

          DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

          OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

                          KYLO REN
           Thank you.
          ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

                          FINN

                          (ALSO PANTING)
           No, no.
          Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
          KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
          life slipping away.
          Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

          THE STRUCTURE!

          Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
          horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
          CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
          REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.

          then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
          ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
          them with long strides.
          Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
          the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
          rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

                          FINN
           The Falcon's this way.
          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
          forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
          out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
          they can't run.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
          out the saber, ignites it.
          A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

          STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
          Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
          BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
          FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
          She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

           no no no...
          Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
          KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
          REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

                          KYLO REN

           TRAITOR!
          In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

                          FINN
           Come get it.
          Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
          Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
          Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
          Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
          COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
          this challenge more!
          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
          LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
          wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
          AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
          the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
          Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
          BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
          balance.

          -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

          KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

          REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

          BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

          SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
          Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
          Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
          It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
          defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
          by her raw, innate skill.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          NIV LEK
           We just lost R-1!

                          JESS
           We're overwhelmed! What do we do?
           It isn't working!
          Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
          from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:

                          YOLO ZIFF
           Black Leader, there's a brand new
           hole in that oscillator. Looks like
           our friends got in!

                          POE
           Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm on it!

                          ELLO ASTY
           Roger!

                          POE
           Everybody else, hit the target hard!
           Give it everything you got!
          And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
          trench leading to the oscillator structure!

                          POE
           I need some help here! I need some
           help!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm coming in!

                          JESS
           Watch out!

                          ELLO ASTY
           I'm hit!
          The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.

                          POE
           All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
           and cover me!

                          NIV LEK
           Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
           Poe!
          The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
          into the fiery breach.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS

          Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

          THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:

                          STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
           Weapon at full capacity in thirty
           seconds.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Prepare to fire.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
          fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
          interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
          volley of torpedoes.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
          and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground

          EXPLOSIONS!

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
          BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
          as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
          She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
          dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
          MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
          Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
          DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

          MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

                          KYLO REN
           You need a teacher! I can show you
           the ways of the Force!

                          REY
           The Force.
          Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
          she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
          SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
          FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
          BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
          Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
          GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

          AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

          CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
          SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
          And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
          But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
          even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
          SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
          giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
          watches this out the control room window in horror. He
          hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

                          COLONEL DATOO
           Lieutenant, get back to your station!

                          YOUNG TECHNICIAN
           (stops, fleetingly)
           Just look. We won't survive -- even
           Hux has gone!
          As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

           GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
           Supreme Leader.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
          distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
          but is horrified, heartsick:

                          GENERAL HUX
           The fuel cells have ruptured. The
           collapse of the planet has begun.
          Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

                          SNOKE
           Leave the base at once and come to
           me with Kylo Ren.

                          (GRIM)
           It is time to complete his training.

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
          FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
          FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
          sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

                          REY
           Finn! Finn...
          Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
          body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
          holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
          They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
          planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
          is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

          LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
          KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

          ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
          CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

          EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie exits the ship.
          MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
          with them back into the ship --

          INT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          POE
           All teams! I got eyes on them!

                          SNAP
           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

                          POE
           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

                          MEDIC
           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

                          C-3PO
           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

                          (MORE)

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           (he swats R2-D2, who

                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

                          LEIA
           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

                          POE
           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

                          C-3PO
           Oh! The map! It is complete!

                          LEIA
           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

                          C-3PO
           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

                          REY
           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

                          LEIA
           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

                         

                         

                          THE END
Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace



TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by
a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.

EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE

Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of
Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the
conflict.....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT


In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one
of the battleships.

QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship
looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER
DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless
protocol gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

EG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.

OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
here and now where it belongs.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,
we're done for!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.

NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
tray of drinks.

TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
viewscreen.

OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
look.

NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
center of the blast door.

RUNE : ...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.

QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
seen.

P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
their laser swords.

OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.

QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

TEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE : At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING
COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
pleased.
AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
yours.
NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
settlement.
NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
the Senate. You assume too much.
AMIDALA : We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
NUTE : It's too late now.
RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications
down there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dare go that far.
CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security
volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation
warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy
swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the
rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one
of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of
the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run
past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
shell in one hand.

JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
caught by surprise.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta
here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa
culled Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
JAR JAR : Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON : Stay down!

His head pops up.

JAR JAR : ...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts
back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to
catch his breath.

OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR
JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I
hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN : What's this?
QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
QUI-GON : No??!
JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON : You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading
this way...
OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR
tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that
turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't
expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the
water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh
Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS
armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The
GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping
trio.

JAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps
and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR : How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS
NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new
weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink
day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come
here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no
nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of

OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
you will affect the other. You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no

QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON : We need a transport.
BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen
through da core. Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be
too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have
saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR : Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
with us?...Here, take over.
JAR JAR : Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
JAR JAR : Yo dreamen mesa hopen...,br QUI-GON : Just relax, the Force will
guide us...
JAR JAR : Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
JAR JAR : Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe
mesa...ooooh...aaaa.....clumsy.
OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.

JAR JAR : Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked
them with its long gooey tongue.

QUI-GON : Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub
flies into the mouth of the creature.

JAR JAR : Oooops.
OBI-WAN : Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases
the sub from its mouth.

JAR JAR : Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the
hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The
lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the
gloom.

QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the
time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.
NUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
NUTE : Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the
power drive drops.

OBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

QUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN : Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.

JAR JAR : Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON : Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN : You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the
tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips
away.

QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to
Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

NUTE : Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is
brightly lit.

JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.

JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
huge waterfall.

JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.

QUI-GON : Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
starts in after him.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to
pull QUI-GON out of the water.

OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons

QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

JAR JAR : Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,
PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and
FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.

BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see
our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.
OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO
BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza
is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an
attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the
DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to
QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme
Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make
contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are
behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE
DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be
careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),
followed
by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and
SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those
people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,
they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the
GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS
rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC
OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER
PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the
ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger
and fire as the ship takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at
them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the
deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying
out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The
Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive
is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the
blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He
will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi
become aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before
QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA : ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a
doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA : It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps.CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will
be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled
by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on
this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astra Droid.
JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

JAR JAR : Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is
embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME : That's all right.
JAR JAR : I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME : Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

JAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... PADME : I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,
You're a Gungan, aren't you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with
us?
JAR JAR : Me no know...mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning

mesa knowen it...pow! Mesa here. (he shrugs)...getten berry berry skeered.

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. ANBOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A
large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport
of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up
to him and falls to his knees.

JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer)
enters the main area.

OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head
to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the
distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA : Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport
is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass
dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this
exotic enviroment.

QUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous
tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for
those who do not wish to be found...
PADME : ....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

JAR JAR : Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze)
Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship
dealers.

QUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships
stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are
greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a
hummingbird.

WATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?
(subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)
QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and
ANAKIN flinches.

WATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)
WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the
store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon)
Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure
out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON : Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME.
She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a
little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.
Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN : Are you an angel?
PADME : What?
ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They
live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in
the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most
hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of
angels.

ANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME : You're...a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

ANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original
state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a
hyperdrive.

WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It
would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all
this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need
something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will
do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand
again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.
WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all
come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.
ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

ANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
things. I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah...
ANAKIN : ...Anakin.
PADME : Anakin.
ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker.
PADME : Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

WATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
(Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't
know nothing.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
(subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you
can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two
buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking
creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously
watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on
board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking
about.
QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR
grabs his arm.

JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un
crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is
walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough
gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like
creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks
out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly
appears.

VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets
around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR
moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the
hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :
(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan
desperately tries to scramble to safety.

JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up
to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,
Sebulba...This one's very connected.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada
you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd
hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time
we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du
pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.)

QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called
Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down
the crowded street.

JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and
begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN : This storm's going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.

CAPTAIN PANAKA'S comlink sounds off.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor,
old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not
hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
gives them their pallies.

JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,
very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down
the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

ANAKIN : Mom! Mom! I'm home.
JAR JAR : Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters
from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

SHMI : Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
any of your names.
QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a
little beep.
PADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

QUI-GON : Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN : Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.
QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll
never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy. SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered
a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one
eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a
Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and
whistles.

THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO
BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is
catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us
what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I
will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no
difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will
have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will
be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is
going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the
city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the
outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave
quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift
table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.
JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
little brighter red.

SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
luck.
SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

JAR JAR : How wude.
PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic's anti-slavery laws...
SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks askance at her son.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
QUI-GON : What?
ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
slaves...have you come to free us?
QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
secret.
ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
it.
ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
need...
JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
races.
QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
properly.
ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
makes you do it.

ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI : Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
find another way...
SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
he can help you...he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and
rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts
shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing
next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.
PADME : Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.

WATTO : Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN : No batta!
WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford
parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
built."
WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a
follish one, methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a
long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and
there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in
the courtyard below.

QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of
reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the
way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl
of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and
Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER : What? With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to
run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be
bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of
the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps
him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his
mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets
his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get
words out that make sense.

QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :
Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts
the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR
JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with
a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The
BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

QUI-GON : There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI : (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.) Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood
stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the
situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus,
scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and
studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the
lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on
his electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is
asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

PADME : I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on
an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He is leading a second EOPIE
behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he
sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,
yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.

ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as
KITSTER arrives.

ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

PADME : He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied
for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes
on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO : ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
QUI-GON : Patienc, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the
suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
business.
QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his
shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
QUI-GON : Why?
WATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
WATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
mother.
WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
QUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.

WATTO shakes his head.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.
WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
nothing.
QUI-GON : The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

WATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the
race, so...it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO
walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting
on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
(Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

ANAKIN : What did he mean by that?

QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time,
Annie.
PADME : Do what?
KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
PADME : You've never won a race?
ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
PADME : Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
QUI-GON : Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of
Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN,
QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A
large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand
people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the
racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

FODE/BEED : -
A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos

classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.)
B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the
Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto
the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of
Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW
MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by
aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.

FODE/BEED : -
(O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!)
B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord

Pixelito. By far the favorite today.)
B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.)
B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY

Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued
creature parts and colorful drinks.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and
waves to the crowd.

FODE/BEED : -
A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our
glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)

The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans
and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.

JABBA : (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small
pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.

SHMI : Be safe.
ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

JABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin
SKywalker tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his
introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and
JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that
everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.

JAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs
on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone
has noticed.

PADME : You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN : I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a
sinister grin.

SEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You
won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,
slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON
approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

JABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy
straps himself into the tiny racer.

QUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on
the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the
Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,
and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a
switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines
igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS
flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens
carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

JAR JAR : Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED : -
A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated)
B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and
JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI : Is he nervous?
QUI-GON : He's fine.
PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME : You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

FODE/BEED : -
B : Start your engines.

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the
start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods
and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around
him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!)
B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm
around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines
ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one
quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the
leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA
drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock
formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.
ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side
ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,
then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast
that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.
Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.

FODE/BEED : -
B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small,
hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange
alien named FANTA.

JAR JAR : Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON
watch another screen and look worried.
ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver
of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by
another racer, XELBREE.
SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side
vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
alien's engine.
The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.
ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for
any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.
The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
Anakin's defeat.
The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all
directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground
as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S)
B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is
very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :
What gooie-on?
FANTA : Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands
and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME
look worried.

JAR JAR : He musta crash-ud.
PADME : Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.
ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
some attention.)
ODY : Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
course.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns.
SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.
Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
stretch of the track.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : He's catching Sebulba.
A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : That little human being is out of his mind.
A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
B : They're side by side!
A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
spinning.
The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
the winner.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE/BEED : -
B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in
tandem with partner)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds
of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO
sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO : You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow
you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release
the boy.
WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
QUI-GON : Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can
settle this.
WATTO : No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!

The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.

ANAKIN : Ah, gee...enough of this...
SHMI : It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have
none. I'm so very proud of you...
PADME : We owe you everything.
ANAKIN : Just feeling this good was worth it.

In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of
parts.

QUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to
the ship.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.
PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE,
only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI
wave as they ride off.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES;
JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.
OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going
back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns
and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow
is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is
towering above them. KITSTER is with them.

QUI-GON : What's this?
ANAKIN : He said I cheated.
QUI-GON : Did you?
ANAKIN : No!
QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO : Yes.
QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his
opinion, fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over
to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

WALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel.
QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them
to the boy.

QUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN : What?!?
QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

ANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,
or what?
QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
starship and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
Mom?!
QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I want to go.
QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
ANAKIN : Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and
QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
you, Mom
QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
ANAKIN : But the money from selling...
QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands
in hers, she draws him close.

SHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let
go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from
setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a
look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN : I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI : I love you, Annie...now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.
QUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI : He was in my life for such a short time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves,
he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at
him blankly.

ANAKIN : Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
THREEPIO : Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although
I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you
coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great
pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO : Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's hovel. SHMI
stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket
and gives them to KITSTER.

KITSTER : There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a
hero.
ANAKIN : I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

KITSTER : Well.
ANAKIN : Well.
KITSTER : Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
ANAKIN : I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his
mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and
runs back to his mother.

ANAKIN : (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and
looks him in the face.

SHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase
the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses
several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

SHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something
you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you
can do this...
ANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?
SHMI : What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.
SHMI : Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I
promise.
SHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and
don't look back... don't look back.
ANAKIN : I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he
marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past
QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look
back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a
speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit stand. ANAKIN
hands JIRA some coins.

ANAKIN : I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit
with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

JIRA : Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN : Sure.

She gives him a hug.

JIRA : I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You
be careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As
they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of
his eye.
Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing
around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON
inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN : What is it?
QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before.
Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard
time keeping up.

ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a
speeder bike.

QUI-GON : Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL
jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord
has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are
bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof
dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets
up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to
the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN
PANAKA are working.

ANAKIN : Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
CAPT. PANAKA : Who are you?
PADME : He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and
RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

CAPT. PANAKA : Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT : I don't see anything.
OBI-WAN : Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another
in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly
over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a
moment.
Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely
makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings
his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and
onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away,
leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the
floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing
hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt.

ANAKIN : Are you all right?
QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN : What was it?
QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us?
QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no
doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent
stare.

QUI-GON : We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN : Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.

QUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last
laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be
seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO
BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind.
DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS
watch.

NUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is
lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much
sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

OOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room.
She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is
stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he
rests.
PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with
a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking
verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his
eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.

PADME : Are you all right?
ANAKIN : It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is
cold.
ANAKIN : You seem sad.
PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for
you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will
bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it
around her neck.

PADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always
remain.
ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

PADME : ...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is
one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on
a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street
level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE,
and
MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME
smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in
person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant
situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the
duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a
skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around)
Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The
situation has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand
behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are
waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what
is being said.

JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.

CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.

PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and
their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility,
only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is
little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we
must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the
Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.

YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
YODA : Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY Anakin, tentative, walks down one of
the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor
that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.

GUARD : May I help you, son?
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE : Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.
RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE : I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

AMIDALA : (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.

AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
goodbye.
AMIDALA : We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape
of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in
the center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,
QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo
congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,
Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I
promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion
to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of
Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute
you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade
routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the
Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently
elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished
delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the
Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without
reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on
the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor
Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
"vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a
roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands
speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in
Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.

BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must
be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures
committee for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

ASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be
voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will
begin the vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.

VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have
betrayed me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know
it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would
just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I
sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR
JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta
grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to
succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your
Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I
will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence
over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong
sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do
here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have
decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in
danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It
is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If
you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to
stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to
the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile
on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
COUNCIL.

YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU : No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

QUI-GON : No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war
until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the
ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the
platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls
overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel
himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO
TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her
HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve
and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means
to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON
and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no
further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life
forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as
they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and
gauges.

ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force
you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no
army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one
Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on
the view screen.

PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark
as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into
the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.

ANAKIN : Hi! Where have you been?
PADME : Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld
decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the
ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON : Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our
power to help her.
OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the
trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam,
Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in
amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

JAR JAR : Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if
there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
FOUR
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry,
no Gungas...no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA : Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR : No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred
place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON : Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and
sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

JAR JAR : Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN
TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS : Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR : We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

CAPT. TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN
refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive
carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the
top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA : I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS : Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en
omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously,
and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME : Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
protection...my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in
peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we
do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I
beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is
a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled
by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in
the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient... Let them make the first move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the
landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells
down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a
battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS
NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
GUARDS
and PILOT pile out and join the group.

PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I
could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much
stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the
waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create
a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're
inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be
killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with
interest, as does ARTOO.

PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting
the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through
the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do
not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be
using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the
Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to
our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE
- DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly
there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a
GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL
OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit
the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted
on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of
the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on
the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by
about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a
small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans
over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay
there.
ANAKIN : Sure.
QUI-GON : And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at
the BATTLE DROIDS.
As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush
into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS
rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for
cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at
PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view
screen.

NUTE : I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is
too close!
RUNE : What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

DARTH MAUL : I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected
by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until
they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE
DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get
ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS
OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the
protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls
of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz
past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS
right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the
DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME : Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN
is hiding.

FIGHTER PILOT : Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as
it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a
second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter
to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting
one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwlm the
few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the
cockpit.

ANAKIN : Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN
PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL
takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword
light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into
their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS. The
JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

ANAKIN : Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship
begins to shake.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out
several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have
moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily
distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a
palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear
life.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once,
flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on
the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the
hangers and attack.

RIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the
wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's
gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.
OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF
WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle.
They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves
once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with
energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.
ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

ANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire
it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

ANAKIN : (cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the power generator
area next door.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship. The JEDI
and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed
power generator. DARTH MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI
follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a
hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

PADME : We don't have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA : Let's try the outside stairway.

CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside
the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE,
EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the
BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are lined up
along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and
fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the
pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the
OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.

EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run
from the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.
JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the
balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.
The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes
behind him (over his left shoulder).

ANAKIN : Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and
instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the
enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through
it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.

ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin.
ARTOO screams.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge
bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power
pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on
a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs
to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots
down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several
walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
DARTH MAUL.
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER
SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns
around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping
them in the middle.
PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't....
PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to
EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees
the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals
a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and
lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump
off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off.
JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps
onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly
rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK
LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a
split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a
small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before
he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated
OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes
his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON
slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and
DESTROYER DROIDS.
JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.

JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE
DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you
to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the
TEN GUARDS in the room.

NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to
PADME.

NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that
opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an
OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to
close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA
throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and
afraid.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before
hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD
attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they
fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting
pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH
MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the
endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,
OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing
DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH
down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

OBI-WAN : Master! Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding
the ship. He ducks back down.

ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll
blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by
ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

TEY HOW : Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main
reactor...
DOFINE : Impossible!! I don't...

The bridge explodes.

INT. NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to
explode from the inside out.

RIC OLIE : I don't know, we didn't hit it.
BRAVO THREE : Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in
circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN
DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.

JAR JAR : Wierdind...

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN and ARTOO follow the squad of yellow Naboo starfighters into the
main hanger.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as thye exit their ships.

BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted
the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in
amazement.

ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard
of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and
RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the
NEIMOIDIANS.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and
explain all this.
CAPT. PANAKA : I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead
the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR
PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA
and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to
see you again.
PALPATINE : It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your

NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser.

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not
quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of
the room.

YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without
the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the
council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.

JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum
roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.
ANAKIN : What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

MACE WINDU : There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
YODA : Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an
apprentice.
MACE WINDU : But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look.

EXT. SPACE	

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . 

INT. ARGO CITY

AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.

THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.

					TEACHER
				And now, who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for Kryptonian covalent 
				bonding?

The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.

CHILD
				The cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared.

The teacher smiles.

TEACHER
				Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...

THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .

A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.

Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

KARA
What are you making:

	ZALTAR
It's going to be a tree, I think.




KARA 
What's a tree?

	ZALTAR
It's something they have on Earth. You know,
 where your cousin went.

	KARA 
Where is Earth?

	ZALTAR
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in 
school?

	KARA
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in 
my head.

Zaltar laughs.

					ZALTAR
				Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in 
outer space. And we're in inner space. 

	KARA
I don't understand.

	ZALTAR
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. 

Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.

					ZALTAR.
				This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. 
I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I 
can do with it. 

Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.

				ZALTAR
			You see, a tree is a living thing.

				KARA
			Can you create life?

	
ZALTAR
				No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of 
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real 
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays 
over the surface. . . 

A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

WOMAN'S VOICE 
Kara. Kara.

Kara calls out in reply.

					KARA 
I'm here, mother.

Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.

ALURA
				Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge 
without a grown-up.

	KARA
I'm sorry, Mother.

	ZALTAR
I was keeping an eye on her.


Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.

ALURA
				Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.

Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.

ZALTAR
				You and your husband have been kind to me, 
Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going 
away. Soon.

	ALURA 
But where?


Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.

She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.

ZALTAR
				Good. Now, go make something pretty.

Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.

ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom 
Zone.

	ALURA
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

	ZALTAR
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself 
to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy, 
glittery stuff....

Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.

ALURA
				But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We 
were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. 
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!

In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.

ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other 
people come second.

	ALURA
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.

ZALTAR 
Kara---the Power Source!

Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. 

The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.

KARA
				I'm sorry... I didn't know.

					ZALTAR
				It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use 
the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

	ALURA
But the Power Source, Zaltar.

	ZALTAR
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do 
with three.

	ALURA
But what will happen?

	ZALTAR 
The Guardians will be angry. They may even 
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't 
really have permission to borrow it. I must go 
explain to them...

Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.

EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES

A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.

Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..

SELENA 
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.

George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.

					GEORGE
				You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks 
too pretty to eat.

	SELENA
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's 
all covered with ants.

She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.

					GEORGE
				Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled 
down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.

SELENA
				Why George, are you proposing?

					GEORGE
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring 
in much now, but...

SELENA
				George---I thought you'd never ask.

A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.

GEORGE
				What the heck is that?

They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.

SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?

Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.

Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.

SELENA
				That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, 
but I've never seen it before.

She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

GEORGE
				Hey, where you going?

					SELENA
				     (calling over her shoulder) 
I've got things to do.

	GEORGE 
What about my proposal?

	SELENA 
         (dismissively) 
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

She gets in the pickup and. drives away.

GEORGE 
Hey! My truck!

DISSOLVE TO:








 KARA' S FACE

She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.

ALURA
				      (voice over)
				But Kara, you are too young to go.

ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED

They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.

KARA
				I am almost an adult. This is what I want.

ZOR-EL
				But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to 
Earth. The journey is dangerous.

	KARA
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.

	ZOR-EL
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

	KARA
I allowed it to escape the City.

	ALURA
Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman 
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place.

	KARA
Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our 
scanning shows the Power Source has finally 
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back.

	ZOR-EL 
Superman will return it.

	KARA
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He 
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-

	KARA
I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. 
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a 
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.

Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.

					ALURA
				What do your teachers think?

Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.

					TEACHER
				It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much 
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's 
fighting for, Zor-El.

	ZOR-EL
Very well, let it be done.

Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.

KARA
				Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied 
the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.

Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.

ALURA
				But they are such strange, unstable people.

					KARA
				Then I will learn to act strange like them.

Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.

					KARA
				I have made clothing and copies of their money, I 
will be fine.




Her father puts his hand on her shoulder .

					ZOR-EL
				Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.

					KARA
				As brave as my father. As wise.

They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.

 Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.

Her parents watch as she floats away.

She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.

MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.

Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.

She lands on a nearby beach.
 
EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE

She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.

Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she 
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.

She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY

Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY

Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.

CUT TO:
 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY

Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.

INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.

BACK TO SCENE.  DAY

Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.

EXT. FOREST.  DAY

She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.

EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY

A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.

SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .

BIANCA
				Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.



					SELENA
				Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. 
He's just a sore loser.

An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.

ELDERLY MAN
				I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

SELENA 
What do you want?

	ELDERLY MAN 
Western Europe.

	SELENA
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could 
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.

	ELDERLY MAN
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.

Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.

SELENA 
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.

NIGEL
				It may well be. I know how you won that election 
Selena. You can't fool me.

	SELENA
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places.

					NIGEL
				You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.
You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. 
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.

SELENA
				I just did. Because I have the Power.

					NIGEL
				You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow 
is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. 

Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.

SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as 
long as I don't go too far. 

	NIGEL
Cigarette?

He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.

INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.

BACK TO SCENE.

Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.

					NIGEL
				Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.


Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.

SELENA
				Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering 
back.
Nigel shakes his head.

NIGEL
				You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate.

	SELENA
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now 
burn rubber.

Nigel locks eyes with her.

NIGEL
				Make me.

He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.

Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.


NIGEL
				Balefire on you, Selena!

					SELENA
				    (grinning)
				You Scorpios can never take a joke.

All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. 

					NIGEL
				You think you are on top now. Well there is someone 
coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.

	SELENA 
Throw him out.

Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.

NIGEL
				You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!

The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. 

Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.
	
					BIANCA
				Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the Circle: Selena!

Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.

SELENA
				Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a 
great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was 
our leader.

More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  

					SELENA
				And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit 
of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year...

A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.

Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.

Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.

The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.

ELDERLY MAN 
Is this Nigel's doing?

SELENA
				It's a warning, that's for sure.

					ELDERLY MAN
				Maybe it was just an accident.

					SELENA
				     (mysteriously)
				There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has 
meaning, if you can read the signs.

The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.

ELDERLY MAN
				Then what does it mean???




Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.

SELENA
				Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY

 A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.

In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY

Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.

MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.

MYRA
				Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really 
scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

Linda walks on up to the next f1oor.

INT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL

Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.

INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.

 MR. DANVERS
				Don't you believe in knocking?

LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.

MR. DANVERS 
What can I do for you?

	LINDA 
I'm Linda Lee.

My cousin wrote you.

MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.


MR . DANVERS 
Cousin? Wrote me?

Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.

Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.

LINDA
				The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.

MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.

					LINDA
				I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry 
about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPUS. DORM

MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.

MR DANVERS
				...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 
start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, 
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology 
and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. 
I think we'll put you in "G" dorm.

He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm.

INT. DORM. CORRIDOR

MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. 

A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.

STUDENT MONITOR
				Man on the floor!

Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door.

INT. DORM ROOM

LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up.

LUCY
				Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?

LUCY
				It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.

					MR DANVERS
				Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. 
Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her 
cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of 
enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads 
her into the room chattering away excitedly.

LUCY
				Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a 
hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one 
get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, 
some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness...
 
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.








Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.

LINDA 
I can do that.

	LUCY
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
	
LINDA 
There isn't any.

LUCY
This is all your clothes?

Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN.

LINDA
				I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a 
chance since...

	LUCY
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or 
something?

	LINDA
I'd rather not talk about it.

	LUCY
You're not...an orphan are you?

	LINDA
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

	LUCY
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, 
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

LINDA
				Thank you. You're very kind.




LUCY
				I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was 
something tragic if you show up without a 
wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this.

Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda.

											CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY

Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up.

LINDA
She did that deliberately.

	LUCY
She's a beast.

The pack turns and heads back toward them, the lead. Myra slaps the puck directly at. steps in front of it to protect Lucy. The and shatters. .Play stops. The girls mill confusion, picking up the little pieces of with Myra in Lucy. Linda puck hits Linda around in puck.

					LUCY 
How'd you do that?

LINDA
				Must've been a defective puck.

INT. LOCKER ROOM. DAY

Girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms. Showers are running in the background. Linda unlaces her shoes. Lucy is unlacing beside her.

					LUCY
				Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
				
LINDA 
But what for?

LUCY
				She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.





INT. SHOWER. LATER. DAY

Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower.

Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

MYRA
				      (whispering)
Are they in?

Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position.

MYRA
				Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.

She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve.

MUFFY
				But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and 
give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, 
could scald them.

MYRA
				So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.

Myra pulls on the wrench.

INT. SHOWER

Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTING CLASS

MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.


MR DANVERS
				Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take 
weeks before the computer. It still takes a long 
time without certain algorithms.

Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision.

EXT. CAMPUS

A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.

Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.

INT. CLASS

Linda smiles to herself.

MR. DANVERS (O.S.) 
Linda? Are you with us?

She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.

LINDA
				Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.

She looks at the board.

LINDA
				The answer is 5,271,009,010.

Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.

MR. DANVERS
				You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in 
the future.

She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.



EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY

Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front.

INT. CADILLAC

Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca.

SELENA 
Stop the car!

Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL

The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac.

INT. CADILLAC

Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.

SELENA
				I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

					BIANCA 
What is it?

		SELENA
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.

					SELENA 
What does it mean?

BIANCA
				The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.

SELENA
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a 
baseball game?

	BIANCA
Softball.

	
SELENA
				It must be the girls. One of the girls.

					BIANCA 
But which one?

SELENA
				Drive on. We have already attracted enough 
attention.

Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.

SELENA
				We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls 
just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to 
something--we'll find out.

	BIANCA
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

The car swerves slightly.

SELENA
				Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at 
the wheel. OK?

	BIANCA 
Sorry, mistress.

CUT TO:

EXT. DORM. DAY

Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in.

INT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY

Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda, you in there?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Uh-huh.

Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
LUCY
				How much longer you gonna be?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Not long. I'm cutting my hair.

Lucy crosses to the bathroom door. 

LUCY
				You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.

INT. BATHROOM OFF DORM ROOM. DAY

Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				I can manage, thanks.

Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand.

INT. DORM

LUCY
				I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only 
thing was to go totally punk!

Linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. She is wearing her brunette wig and her Linda clothing. Lucy is puzzled.

LUCY
				Your hair looks the same.

LINDA
				It was just a trim.

The student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.

JODY
				Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home.

					LUCY 
What's in it?

JODY
				A hair dryer that makes popcorn!

					LUCY 
Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.

Lucy hurries to the door. Linda holds back.

LINDA
No thanks. You go on.

	LUCY
You sure?

Linda nods bravely, and Lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. Linda stands alone in the room.

A beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. Linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.

 INT. DORM LOUNGE

Lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by Gloria's new hair dryer. The package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. Some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. One of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "There's No Place Like Home". One by one the other girls join in. It's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to Linda's loneliness.

INT. LINDA'S DORM ROOM

Linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. From down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.

GIRLS .o.s.)
"Be it ever so humble, There's no place like 
home..."

A tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in Linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. She steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.

ALURA (o.s.) 
Kara, my darling...

	LINDA
Mother! Is it you? Where are you???

	ALURA (o.s.)
In Argo City. Have you found the Power Source?


	LINDA
Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where 
to begin to look.

ALURA (o.s.)
				Kara, be careful. There is some terrible evil force coming 
near you. I can feel it. Keep to your disguise. Let no one
know who you are.

LINDA
				But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.

ALURA (o.s.)
				There are more powers in the universe than we know. 
And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And
come home safely.

The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.

The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.

GIRLS (o.s.) 
"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be 
it ever so humble, There's no place like home."

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY

Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity. 

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT

Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line.

MR . DANVERS
				Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, 
nine thousand, and ten.

He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.



EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER

The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down.

MR. DANVERS
				No plans for the weekend, Linda?

LINDA 
No, MR. Danvers.

MR. DANVERS
				Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't 
you come home with us for dinner?

LINDA 
I'd love to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY

Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena.

BIANCA
				Is he your entertainment for tonight?

					SELENA
				He will be. In about five minutes.

					BIANCA
				Have fun.

Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors.

EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY.

Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. 

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

SELENA 
Finished your estimate?

	ETHAN
Well, there's several ways to go .

SELENA
				Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.

SELENA
				You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always 
see your truck parked around.

	ETHAN
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my 
service.

	SELENA
I bet they do.

	ETHAN
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.

	SELENA
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.

Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.

					ETHAN
				Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending 
on how alkaline your soil is. 

Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.

					SELENA 
				I just love plants and growing things. It must be 
wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!

Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.

ETHAN
				Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day.


Selena gestures outside.
	
SELENA
				But look, it's almost sundown!

Ethan glances outside. Selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.

ETHAN
				Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some 
honeysuckle there and there...

Selena pouts exaggeratedly.

SELENA
Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family 
recipe, I'm famous for them.

Ethan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.

ETHAN 
What is it?

	SELENA
A passionfruit smoothee.

		ETHAN
Well, just one.

He takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.

SELENA
				To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.

ETHAN 
I'll drink to that.

He takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.


ETHAN 
Hmmm. Delicious!

He tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly.

ETHAN
Now, about my fee...

He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.

SELENA
				Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes 
and be all mine.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Selena looks up with annoyance.

SELENA
				If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...

She angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan.

SELENA
				Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.

SELENA 
Nigel, get lost.

NIGEL
				I have to talk to you.

					SELENA
				You're wasting your breath.

					NIGEL
				You used to listen to me. When you asked me to 
teach you something of the Craft.

	SELENA
I could teach you a thing or two now.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Ethan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously.

INSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN

The room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours.


BACK TO SCENE

Ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Selena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him.

NIGEL
				...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great 
Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me 
like that?

SELENA
				I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a 
good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

Nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.

NIGEL
				Nothing's wrong with my skin.

					SELENA
				Such a shame. You ought to take better care of 
yourself.

Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.

NIGEL 
Nasty bitch!

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET

Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself.

ETHAN 
Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors.

					SELENA 
Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything!
INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.

MRS. DANVERS
				I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. 
The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.

Linda stands up from the chessboard.

LINDA
				Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. 
Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a 
terrific chess player MR. Danvers.

	MR. DANVERS 
What? Me?

LINDA
				Sure. Mate in five moves.

She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...

LINDA
				...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't 
see it coming. Well, bye.

She walks out the door into the night.

MRS . DANVERS
				What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must 
have her back, don't you think?

MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.

SELENA
				Show me Ethan.

She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

SELENA 
The silly fool! 
EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT

Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road.

LUCY 
Hey, Linda!
     (to the boy) 
It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off 
the wall!

Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's...
his folks are away...

LINDA 
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out
for an overnight.

	LUCY
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom 
window. McCloskey's always zonked out: 
she'll never hear you.

	LINDA
It doesn't seem right.

	LUCY
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him.

LINDA 
Look at that guy!

Lucy whirls around and looks. 

					LUCY
				What a space cadet. 
      (yelling and waving) 
Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!

Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.


INSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V.

He sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. All sound is similarly distorted and far away.

BACK TO SCENE

LINDA	
				Why is he acting so strangely?

					LUCY
				I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle. She looks at the IMAGE OF ETHAN in 
her mirror.

SELENA
				Power of Shadows...bring him to me. 


The box in her hand glows with an inner light.

EXT. STREET OPPOSITE H]1..MBUP.GER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

There is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.  A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.

LUCY
				Omigod, it's a runaway!

Lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.

LINDA 
Lucy; come back!

	LUCY
Somebody's gotta do something!!

Lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.

EXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT

A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.

EXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT

Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.

MOTHER
My baby!!!!!

Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.

MOTHER
				My baby.

She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .

The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . 



Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE.

Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.

Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.

INT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER

Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.

SUPERGIRL
				Everything's going to be all right. She's just 
unconscious. No broken bones.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP

Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.

BACK TO SCENE

There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.

ETHAN 
God...you're beautiful.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.


ETHAN (in the mirror) 
God...you're beautiful.

	SELENA
That was meant for me!

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE

SUPERGIRL
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

ETHAN
Wait...don't leave me in here...

SUPERGIRL
				It's for your own protection.

She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT

The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.

EXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.

ETHAN 
       (calling from inside) 
What's happening?

	SUPERGIRL
        (shouting over the wind) 
I'm taking you to the hospital.

	ETHAN
           (within)
Let me out. I have to talk to you.

SUPERGIRL
				Later.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT

The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims.

POLICEMAN
				Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's 
no casualties.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror.
BIANCA
				I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?

SELENA
				It's what we were warned about.

Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.

BIANCA 
A Storm Dragon?

	SELENA 
No, a super girl.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside.

FIRST INTERN 
What was that?

	SECOND INTERN 
Maybe we better take a look.

EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys.

					ETHAN 
Don't leave me.

	SUPERGIRL 
I have to.

	ETHAN
When can I see, you again ?

	SUPERGIRL
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. 
Goodbye.


She gives the gurneys a shove.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

The automatic doors open and Ethan and Lucy roll inside on the gurneys.

FIRST INTERN
				Did we use the laughing gas tonight?

					SECOND INTERN 
That was last night.

 					FIRST INTERN
				Then this is really happening.

The two interns catch the gurneys, and start examining Ethan and Lucy.

SECOND INTERN
Hey fella, can you talk???

Ethan begins to babble deliriously.

ETHAN
				The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this 
before. I love her. My angel.

He sits up, tears brimming in his eyes, and grasps the , intern by the lapels.

ETHAN
				Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die 
if I can't have her.

The intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.

FIRST INTERN 
She's right here fella.

	ETHAN
No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us 
through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.

The two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.

SECOND INTERN
				This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
				a 412. Send down the boys from psycho.


ETHAN
				No! She's real ! I saw her !

CUT TO:

 INT. SELENA' S MANSION.  NIGHT

Selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ETHAN IN THE HOSPITAL STRUGGLING WITH THE TWO INTERNS . Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.

SELENA
				Why did she have to show up now?

BIANCA 
Eliminate her.

	SELENA
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

	BIANCA
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman 
on Earth.

SELENA 
Am I? Still?

There is a pause as the implications reverberate.

BIANCA
				Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can 
withstand its power.

SELENA 
I've been saving it. For the right moment.

BIANCA
				That moment is now! What good is a sword unless 
it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare 
oppose you again. No one.

Selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.

SELENA 
Not even Nigel.

Selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
SELENA
				What do I do?  I don't know her name.

					BIANCA
				The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate 
on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.

Selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. 
Find her and destroy her.

A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

SELENA
				Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

BIANCA
				Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.

SELENA
				I think I'd better keep it.

					BIANCA
Whatever you say.

SELENA 
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.

She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.

Mrs. Danvers is on the phone.

Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.

MR. DANVERS
				Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right.
 
MRS. DANVERS
				We should have driven her.

Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket.

MR. DANVERS
				I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,

INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT

Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.

Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.

EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.

The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.

Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.

 INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.

EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.

INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

LINDA
				Hey, that's my roommate's car!

Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.

SUPERGIRL
				Leave this place and do no harm.

Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.




She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.

Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.

EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING

Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.

EXT. CAMPUS

Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. 

She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.

CUT TO:


EXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.

He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.

INT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in.




INT. HOUSEMOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT

A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically.

INT. DORM. HALLWAY.  NIGHT

Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue 
tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed.

				Linda...is it Linda?

Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly.

SUPERGIRL
				I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so 
tired...forgot...

M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed.

MR. DANVERS
				Are you all right?

SUPERGIRL
				Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage 
outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...


					MR. DANVERS
				But why?

SUPERGIRL
				An evil force. Trying to destroy me.

She sits up and looks anxiously at him.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM 

Selena watches their image in her mirror.



SUPERGIRL 
         (image)
				You won't tell anybody, will you?

MR. DANVERS 
       (image)
Not even my wife. And, if there's anything I can do to 
help---I'd be honoured.

INT. DORM. LINDA'S ROOM

Supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes.

SUPERGIRL
				Thank you, Mr. Danvers.

She lapses into a deep sleep. Mr. Danvers stands up, and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture. He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.

CUT T0:

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. DAY

Linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital. 

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY

Lucy Lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. Superman's pal JIMMY OLSEN is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. Lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when Linda enters.

LUCY
				...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't 
let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha 
Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my 
roommate just walked in. Bye.

Lucy hangs up and turns to Linda.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I 
don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy 
Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the 
newspaper.




					JIMMY
				Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your 
cousin Clark taught me everything I know about
the newspaper business.

	LINDA 
Nice to meet you.

She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy.

LINDA
				I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.

					LUCY
				Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the 
insurance money. B.F.D. 

Jimmy keeps looking at Linda.

JIMMY
				Do you have any theories about last night?

					LINDA
				Theories?

					JIMMY
				How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all 
that damage at the school. The police are calling it 
a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -

LUCY 
      (overlapping) 
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one 
second?

JIMMY
				-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural,
				 or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

					LINDA
				I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But 
I don't know what it is.

	JIMMY
Can I quote you?




Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal.

LUCY
				Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers 
in water before they die?

JIMMY
				Oh, sure.

He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party 
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? 
He's private property. I've been waiting years 
for him to develop.

	LINDA 
He's nice.

LUCY
				Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!

Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.

JIMMY
				Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?

					LINDA
				He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.

					JIMMY
				I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !

 EXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON

Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim.

SELENA 
				      (to Bianca)
				This won't take long. Keep the motor running.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON

Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.

INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY

He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.

Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up.

					ETHAN
				Oh no, not you again.

					SELENA
				What an adorable hat.

					ETHAN 
				They think I have a concussion.

					SELENA
				And you think you're in love.

					ETHAN 
I know it.

	SELENA
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you 
a temporary love potion.

ETHAN
				Why should I believe you?

					SELENA 
				It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all 
about that girl.

Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.

					ETHAN
				Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!

Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
SELENA
				Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be 
interested in that puny little girl?

	ETHAN
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

	SELENA
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.

Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
I saw you

SELENA 
                (continuing)
	Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I 
gave you.

Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Nurse!

SELENA
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid 
you don't know who I am.

	ETHAN
Nurse!

	SELENA
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have 
Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get 
what I want.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Help !

The door opens and a NURSE walks in.

					NURSE
				Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying 
to sleep.

ETHAN
				Get her away from me.  She's crazy.


					NURSE 
                   (to Selena) 
Are you family? Visiting hours are over.

SELENA
				They're over for you sweetheart.

Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.

SELENA
				Now you see who you're dealing with.

Ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.

ETHAN 
Leave me alone.

Selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.

					SELENA
				This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving 
you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.

	ETHAN
I don't want your help.

	SELENA
Come back to my house. My car's outside.

Selena reaches out a hand to Ethan.

					ETHAN
				No!

					SELENA
				I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no 
different from the rest!

The door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push  inside, with guns drawn.


SECURITY OFFICER
				Okay, what's going on in h--



Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

Selena ducks out into the corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.

Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow---seize him.

The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE

A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.

The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.

NURSE
				Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas 
problem.

	DOCTOR
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.




INT. X-RAY ROOM

Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.

He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.

INT. DUCT

Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.

CUT TO:


INT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.

LUCY
				Omigod.

A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.

DELIVERY BOY 
Where you want this?

	LUCY
Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him 
a tip, Jimmy.

Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.

					JIMMY
				Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

					LINDA
				Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to 
meet you, Jimmy.

	LUCY
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

	LINDA
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

	LUCY
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna 
be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

Her phone rings and she picks it up.

LUCY
				Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.

JIMMY
				Can I give you a lift?

LINDA 
Oh, no thanks.

	JIMMY
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.

Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

SELENA
				Give up?

Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.

ETHAN
				Never! 

He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.

					SELENA
				What goes up must come down.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. SUNSET

Jimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind 
Selena's Cadillac.

JIMMY
I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass 
on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?

Linda pauses, looking up at the sky.

LINDA 
      (distractedly)
I wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.

Jimmy follows the direction of her gaze.

INSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF

Ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.

BACK TO SCENE

JIMMY 
An escaped wacko! What a picture!

Jimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 

SELENA
				Come down from there, you foo1...

EXT. LADDER ON.THE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY

Although she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.

SELENA
      (continuing)
...before you get blown off and kill yourself.

Ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY.  JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.

LINDA 
Someone's chasing him.

	JIMMY
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the 
accident with Lucy?

LINDA
				Yes.

					JIMMY
				The scoop of the year!

He starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF

SELENA
				It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've 
got the chance.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.

ETHAN
				No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. 
My angel. 

He starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

SELENA
				She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.

ETHAN
				No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive 
somewhere. My angel. My love--


He falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by 
one hand.

SELENA'S VOICE 
You idiot!

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.

					JIMMY
				There goes my Pulitzer Prize.

Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL

A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan's grip fails and he falls.

EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY

Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY

Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.

JIMMY
Darn!

He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.

JIMMY
				Hey lady, did you see that?

Bianca gives him a glance of contempt.

BIANCA
				See what?

					JIMMY
				The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in 
mid-air.

	BIANCA
Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and 
have your head examined.

EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET

Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.

ETHAN
				You're alive! She didn't kill you! 

					SUPERGIRL 
Who didn't?

	ETHAN
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because 
she knows I love you.

	SUPERGIRL 
You love me?

	ETHAN
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my 
life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking 
at you, holding you in my arms... 

	SUPERGIRL
We have to have a long talk about all this.

	ETHAN
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.

 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT

Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her 
aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.

BIANCA
				Home?

					SELENA
				No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a 
				monkey out of me.

					BIANCA
				      (shrewdly)
				Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.

					SELENA
				I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit 
whenever I want.

She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.

INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.

CUT TO:

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

The park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.

THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.

ETHAN
				This is my favourite place in the city.

					SUPERGIRL
				Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

					ETHAN
				They don't care, they're tearing it down for a 
shopping centre.

He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.

ETHAN
				Like it?

					SUPERGIRL
				Yes. It reminds me of home.

					ETHAN
Where Superman's from? Krypton?

	SUPERGIRL
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of 
Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

	ETHAN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

	SUPERGIRL
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to 
find something and I think you can he1p me.

	ETHAN
Come on, let's ride.

They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.

ETHAN
				I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
				
SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

					ETHAN
				Let's talk about us, not her.

					SUPERGIRL
				Tell me where I can find her.

					ETHAN
				I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
			


Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.

SUPERGIRL
				But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her 
she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.

	ETHAN
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of 
our lives.

	SUPERGIRL
We can't do that.

	ETHAN
Why not ?

	SUPERGIRL
We're from different worlds.

	ETHAN
Just give me a chance to show how much I love 
you. Love changes everything. Love makes 
everything possib1e.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.

EXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL

SUPERGIRL
				All this talk about love, it's silly.

					ETHAN
				You don't like me? You hate me?

There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 

SUPERGIRL
				Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.

ETHAN
				What do you feel about me?


					SUPERGIRL
				I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.

THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :

Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.

ETHAN 
				There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

SUPERGIRL 
What's that?

	ETHAN 
Let me kiss you.

SUPERGIRL
				No.

					ETHAN
				You're not afraid are you?

					SUPERGIRL
				Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

ETHAN
				If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from 
years in school.

	SUPERGIRL
Well...I guess one is all right.

She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.

SUPERGIRL 
Is this how?

	ETHAN
Terrific.

Their lips meet. Zowie.

					SELENA
				What a touching scene!

Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.

SUPERGIRL
				Who are you ?

					SELENA
				I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both 
be sorry.

					SUPERGIRL
				I don't scare that easily.

Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.

SELENA
				All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, 
nobody can.

She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel.

SELENA
				Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!

INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS.

INT. DODGEM CARS TENT

He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.

Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.



Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.

SUPERGIRL
				That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.

SELENA 
A cheap trick.

	SUPERGIRL 
Cheap but effective.

INT. DODGEM CAR TENT

Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.

ETHAN
Supergirl'?

He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.

SELENA
				Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. 
Ka-ma-hoochie!

Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.

					BIANCA
				Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

					SELENA
				Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

Bianca pauses uncertainly.

BIANCA
				Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?


					SELENA
                  (evasively)
I don't feel like it right now.

					BIANCA
				She didn't take it from you, did she?

					SELENA
				That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

BIANCA
				There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.

Bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.

BIANCA 
Sycoraka f'kah s'koo...

The bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.

SELENA
				Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of 
the seven.

Bianca bows.

BIANCA 
Yes, mistress.

Bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.

					SELENA
				There you are. Come to mama.

She takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.

CUT TO:







EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

SUPERGIRL
				I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

					ETHAN 
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

SUPERGIRL
				But I have to go back. I brought you here so 
you'd be safe. From her.

	ETHAN
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

His words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.

SUPERGIRL 
I'll stay for a while.

Ethan is filled with enthusiasm.

ETHAN
				Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with 
a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a 
garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, 
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

	SUPERGIRL 
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

Ethan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.

SUPERGIRL
				Well, maybe a little longer than that.

She smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.

CUT TO:



EXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT 

Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.

SELENA 
You're late.

	ELD ERL Y MAN
The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just 
walk out.

	SELENA
You're more afraid of the President than me???

	ELDERLY MAN 
No, of course not.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT

Waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.

Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.

					SELENA
				Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.

OTHERS IN UNISON 
The Circle is complete.

	NIGEL
You better have a pretty good explanation for 
this, Selena.

	SELENA
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the Craft.

	INDIAN WOMAN
But Superman has been away.

	SELENA
It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She 
knows we exist..

	ELDERLY MAN
Then she must be destroyed.

	NIGEL 
How did she find out about us?

	ELDERLY MAN
That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will 
become curious and learn more. When she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will 
try to stop us.

	BIANCA
We must destroy her first.

	ERICA
But how can we destroy her?

SELENA
				By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.

Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.

NIGEL
You! You want to take our power for yourself!

Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.

					SELENA
				Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate 
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.

Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.

					SELENA
	 			      (continuing)
				Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

					NIGEL
				You would! You revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power.

	SELENA
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, 
Nigel?

	NIGEL
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer 
of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.

	SELENA
Nonsense.

Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.

FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.

Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?

BIANCA 
Enough quibbling. Let us vote.

They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.

 					SELENA
				I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?

Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 

NIGEL
I have no choice.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.



The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, what IS wrong?

Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.

					ETHAN
				She said it wouldn't last.

SUPERGIRL
				What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

Ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.

					ETHAN
				I don't love you any more.

SUPERGIRL 
Just like that?

	ETHAN
Like turning off a light.

He struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
					
					ETHAN
				I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that 
mushy talk.

He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.

SUPERGIRL 
Where are you going?


ETHAN 
Away. From you. 

	SUPERGIRL
But why?

ETHAN
				Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

					SUPERGIRL
				I sort of like what you said.

					ETHAN
				That makes it worse.

					SUPERGIRL
				But I don't understand.

He stops and stares at her for a moment.

					ETHAN
				Of course you don't. We're from two different 
worlds, remember?

He stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.

CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM/PAGAN TEMPLE. NIGHT

A barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

SELENA
				At last. Ultimate Power.

					BIANCA
				And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

					SELENA
				What do you mean we?

She turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.

CUT TO:

EXT. BESIDE A STREAM. TROPICAL PARADISE. DAY

Ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.

ETHAN
				Hi.

					SUPERGIRL
				Hello. Are you still mad at me?

					ETHAN
				I'm not mad at you.

					SUPERGIRL
				It seemed that way to me.

					ETHAN
				I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.

					SUPERGIRL 
Miss what?

ETHAN
				What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I 
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of 
things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything 
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world 
around us--like we were a wonderful song...

He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.

SUPERGIRL
				And now?

					ETHAN
				And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words 
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...



	SUPERGIRL
Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe 
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back. 

He turns to her hopefully.

					ETHAN 
You think so?

	SUPERGIRL 
I don't see why not.

	ETHAN
But what if---it wasn't real? 

SUPERGIRL
				Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours 
forever.

Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.

					ETHAN
				Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we 
could get together every now and then and see each 
other. And maybe something might. happen again. 
What do you think?

	SUPERGIRL
Are you asking me for a "date"?

ETHAN
				Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
available.

	SUPERGIRL
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?

	ETHAN
She'll forget about us eventually.

							CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.



SUPERGIRL
      (image)
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...

	ETHAN
        (image)
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped 
like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPIAL ISLAND

Supergirl becomes very excited.

					SUPERGIRL
				That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo 
City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? 

	ETHAN
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better 
stay away from there.

	SUPERGIRL
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only 
thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't 
see the Power Source at the amusement park.

She stands up.

					ETHAN
				Wait. Don't leave me.

SUPERGIRL
				You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have 
the Power Source.

He stands up and takes her hand.

ETHAN 
Before you go...

	SUPERGIRL
What?

	ETHAN 
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.


	SUPERGIRL
And you can see how you feel about me, right?

	ETHAN
Yes.

She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

Supergirl flies into the air.

EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY

Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.

EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY

Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.

EXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY

Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.

EXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN

Supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.

INT. SELENA'S MANSION. FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM

Supergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.

SUPERGIRL
				Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.

BIANCA
				I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. 
But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. 
Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.

	SUPERGIRL
What are you talking about? Where's Selena?

BIANCA
				No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.
				Hurt you.

SUPERGIRL 
I have to find her. Tell me.

Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.

NIGEL
				Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. 
Stop her before it's too late!

Supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE) 

Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.

					ETHAN
				I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

					SELENA
				I could force you.

					ETHAN
				If that worked, you would've done it already. No, 
you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well 
let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell 
before I fall for that one again.

	SELENA
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.


She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.

SELENA
				You've been without water for a whole day. Let's 
see how thirsty you get in a week.

	ETHAN 
You vicious--

	SELENA
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.


She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.

Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.

The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.

Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors
to the garden.




EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY

Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.

The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

SELENA
				I told you I'd win.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.

SELENA
				Kiss me.
	
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.

EXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: 
a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.

EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.


INT. CONSERVATORY

Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 

The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.

Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.

SELENA
				Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.

Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR

Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan! Don't let her do this!

Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.

SUPERGIRL
No. No. It isn't true.

The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.

EXT. SPACE

The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.

EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 

Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.

She hops a few more times, with no more success.

She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.

Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

 ALURA'S VOICE 
Kara, where are you?

	KARA
Mother? I can hardly hear you.

	ALURA. S VOICE
Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared 
from the scanners...

KARA
				I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. 
And I'm weak.

	ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the 
Power Source. The City is dying.

					KARA
				Then send someone else. I failed.

					ALURA'S VOICE
				We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no 
longer have the power to push through.

KARA
				But Mother, I'm lost. 

					ALURA' S VOICE 
You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .

The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 

KARA 
Mother---I tried. I really tried.

Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY

Establishing shot. 

INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. 

INT.  TRANSLATOR"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.

BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.

SELENA
				Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!

The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.

SELENA
				I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of 
Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And 
I bring you myself as her representative here 
on Earth.

The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.

SELENA
				From this moment forth, all science, religion and other
				unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I 
will teach the One True Way of our ancient 
grandmothers.

The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to 
interrupt Selena.

					PRESIDENT
				You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we 
know it.

	SELENA
And it's about time too.

	PRESIDENT
I do not know who you are, or what evil force 
you represent, but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back 
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.

SELENA
				Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. 
I have something better.

She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.

The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.

CUT TO:



EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.

She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.

Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar.

Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.

ZALTAR
				Kara? Is it you?

Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.

SUPERGIRL 
What is this place?

	ZALTAR
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you 
come here from Argo City?

	SUPERGIRL 
I was on Earth...

	ZALTAR
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

	SUPERGIRL
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...


	ZALTAR 
Shouldnt've done that.

	SUPERGIRL
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me 
to the Phantom Zone.

	ZALTAR
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

	SUPERGIRL
I know.

	ZALTAR
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. 
You can stay with me, until I build you your own 
place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.

He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.

					SUPERGIRL
				Others?

					ZALTAR
				Criminals.

Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

					ZALTAR
				A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid 
them. And you should too.

Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City.

SUPERGIRL 
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

	ZALTAR 
What? Palace? Hardly.

	SUPERGIRL
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...


ZALTAR
				Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. 
Must try something new.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE

He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.

SUPERGIRL 
It's lovely. . .

	ZALTAR
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything 
just right. Nobody telling you to change this, 
move that around. Please yourself. That's 
the secret of happiness.

	SUPERGIRL
Are you happy, Zaltar?

ZALTAR
				What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do 
whatever I want. All the time.

	SUPERGIRL
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?

They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.

					ZALTAR
				I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. 
It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.

He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.

SUPERGIRL
				You look at them? How?

					ZALTAR
				The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you 
have the right tools.

Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.



He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.

ZALTAR
				There you see? What could be more boring than that?

He waves his hand, and the image disappears.

SUPERGIRL
				Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?

Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.

					ZALTAR
				It'll only make you sad. 

He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.

					ZALTAR
				This goes closer. This moves it around. And 
this begins.

He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :

EXT. WALL STREET.  DAY

The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY

Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.

EXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY

People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY

The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE

A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.

					SECRETARY
				No more audiences today. Go home. All 
of you.

Through the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like  a pet animal.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SELENA'S SITTING ROOM

The secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "Selena! Selena!"

SELENA
				They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?

					ETHAN
				Yeah.

Selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.

SELENA
				Coming?

Ethan follows her sullenly.

EXT. BALCONY

They walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.

					SELENA
				Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, 
you're Prince Ethan now.

Ethan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S NEW HOUSE.  BENEATH THE BALCONY

The crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl reels with shock at the scene 

SUPERGIRL 
That horrible woman!

	ZALTAR
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would 
make you sad.

He starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.

SUPERGIRL
				No. I have to see this.

Zaltar shrugs.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. MIDVALE. DAY

The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.

INT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY

The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

LUCY
				I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers 
have been arrested!

					JIMMY
				How do you know?

					LUCY
				I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

					JIMMY 
Did anybody notice you?

	LUCY
I can't help it if men notice me.

	JIMMY
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

She kisses him on the nose.

LUCY 
Just kidding. Nobody saw me.

Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.

INT. PRISON

The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.

JIMMY
				I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't 
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

	LUCY
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

JIMMY
				I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.

There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.

LUCY 
Hey! Ethan!

	ETHAN
Hmmm?

LUCY
				Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

					ETHAN .
				Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.

					LUCY
				Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?

					ETHAN
				A little.

					LUCY
				Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We 
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

	ETHAN
I'll mention it upstairs.

He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.

					JIMMY
				The blonde girl who saved your life---where 
is she now?

Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.

ETHAN
				She's gone. No one will ever see her again.

CUT TO:

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE

Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.

SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar, please help me.

	ZALTAR
Of course, my dear. What can I do?

	SUPERGIRL
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. 
They need me.

Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.

					ZALTAR
				There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. 
That's why they send the criminals here.

SUPERGIRL
				If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

					ZALTAR
				No, that's not true---there's well...no--

He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.

ZALTAR 
There is a way.

	SUPERGIRL 
I knew it!

	ZALTAR
But it's impossible.

	SUPERGIRL
Why?

	ZALTAR
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.

					ZALTAR
				I could do it.

She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.

SUPERGIRL 
Then teach me how.

	ZALTAR
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get 
one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a 
sip of this? It's delicious, I think.


He takes another sip of his drink.

SUPERGIRL 
Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.

He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.

ZALTAR
				Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. 
Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a 
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards 
too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have 
the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's 
out of the question.

	SUPERGIRL
Then come with me.

					ZALTAR
				Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

					SUPERGIRL
				You could do anything. You could sculpt 
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! 
You'd have superpowers.

	ZALTAR
 Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?

	SUPERGIRL
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are 
in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power 
Source, Argo City will die.

He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.

ZALTAR
Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.

He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.

SUPERGIRL
				You're going to take me back?

					ZALTAR
				Going to try. Didn't say I could.

EXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.

SUPERGIRL
				I heard my mother ask you once "how could a 
man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" 
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous 
heart.

	ZALTAR
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, 
that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling 
at you. Boring!

Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. HALLWAY

Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.

LUCY
				Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

ETHAN
				I did.

					LUCY
				     (bitterly)
				Well thanks a pile, fella.

Ethan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. DAY

Ethan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.

ETHAN 
What's going on?

Selena snaps irritably at him.

SELENA 
Guess! Go on.

ETHAN
				I don't know. You seem afraid.

					SELENA
				You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?

					ETHAN
				     (the truth dawns on him)
				Supergirl?

Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.

INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.

SELENA
				Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.

She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in 
Selena's eyes.

					ETHAN
				You're not going to hurt her, are you?

Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.

SELENA
				You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

					ETHAN
				Well...I guess I can't.

					SELENA
				I'm ready for her. I'll show you.

Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.



EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY

MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.

SELENA
				Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the 
serpents will drop them one by one. 

Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. 

BACK TO SCENE

ETHAN
				Why the empty cage?

SELENA
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and 
see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd 
hate to lose you, Ethan.

Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.

BACK TO SCENE

Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.

ETHAN
				What...?


					SELENA
				You don't get this far without paying...a 
certain price.

She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.

MR. DANVERS
				If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.

MRS . DANVERS
I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.

She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.

					JIMMY 
       (shyly)
I've been in love with you for years. Remember 
how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? 
And put your fingerprints on my lens.

LUCY
				Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're 
attention.

	JIMMY
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...
all this time?

	LUCY 
You bet your ass.

	JIMMY
Why didn't you tell me?

	LUCY
You're supposed to guess.

She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.

					SUPERGIRL
				Why are you stopping?


					ZALTAR
				Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you 
musn't do.

He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Oh dear!

The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.

ZALTAR 
The wand. Use it.

Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.

					ZALTAR
				Good girl! That's the way!

But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.

					ZALTAR
				You can use the wand.

					SUPERGIRL
				Better than when I was a child.

She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

ZALTAR
				I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like 
your mother.

CUT TO:





INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

ZALTAR
				What's that? Never saw anything like that.

					SUPERGIRL
				Don't stop. Keep moving.

					ZALTAR 
Yes, mustn't stop.

	SUPERGIRL
       (grimly) 
 It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.


SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar. Use the wand!

ZALTAR
				Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.

ZALTAR 
  				       (voice over) 
Goodbye...

	SUPERGIRL
Zaltar!

She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.

SUPERGIRL
				You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.

Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.

EXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND

Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.

She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.

SUPERGIRL
				Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.  

She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.

EXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN

Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.

					ETHAN 
She has hostages.

	SELENA
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

	SUPERGIRL
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.

INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.

BACK TO SCENE

Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.

INT. CONSERVATORY

Jimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.

JIMMY
				Hey, what gives?

The blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.

INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.

SELENA
				All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till 
the last card's dealt.

Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.

All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.

SUPERGIRL
				You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
	
					SELENA
				Not yet.

Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.

ETHAN
				It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!

SUPERGIRL
				How do I fight it?

					ETHAN
				Turn it against her.

Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.

There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.

REAL SELENA
				Power of Shadow, kill her!!

The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.

SECOND SELENA 
No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.

REAL SELENA 
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.

	SECOND SELENA
You are my shadow, you must obey me.

The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.

Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.

ETHAN
				I've got it! The Power Source!

The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.

And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.

REAL SELENA
        (terrified)
No! Stop! Please!


Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. 

					SECOND SELENA
				Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.

					ETHAN
				It is you, then, really?

Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.

SECOND SELENA
				Well?

ETHAN
				It's you all right.

					SECOND SELENA
				I'll make it easy for you.

She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.

					ETHAN
				I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.


					SUPERGIRL
				I never doubted you for a moment.

					REAL SELENA
				Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...

Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.

The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.

SELENA
				I'm free. I can never thank you enough.

SUPERGIRL
				For what?

				
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.

SELENA
				Ever since I found that thing I've been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

SUPERGIRL
				Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to 
Argo City where it won't be misused.
         (to Ethan)
You could come too. It might be safer for you.

ETHAN
				No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll 
vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs.

					SUPERGIRL
				I'll come back as soon as I can.

					SELENA
				What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around 
here.

Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.

ETHAN
				She's right. They'll string her up.

SUPERGIRL
				Do you want to come to Argo City?

SELENA 
				What's it like?

SUPERGIRL
				It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

SELENA 
				Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.

Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.

SUPERGIRL
				Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space.

Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON. DAY

Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.

The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.

EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY

All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.

SUNSET

Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.

SELENA 
Where is inner space?

SUPERGIRL
				It's everywhere. But water is always 
the door.

They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.

EXT. INNER SPACE

Supergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.

SELENA
				Will they be angry with me for 
stealing the Power Source?



	SUPERGIRL
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found 
it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.

SELENA
				Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.

					SUPERGIRL 
				That's home.

P.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA

Argo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source

          As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been said that magic vanished from
           our world a long time ago. And that
           humanity can no longer fulfill its
           desires through the power of wishes.
           To those who have lost the wondrous
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here
           is the story of a little boy, and a

           It began in 1985, in a town just outside
           Boston.
                         
          We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at
          each other in the street.

           It was Christmas Eve, and all the
           children were in high spirits. That
           special time of year when Boston children
           gather together and beat up the Jewish
           kids.
                         
          Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled,
          and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-
          throwing kids points at the sled kid.
                         
                          KID #1
           Hey, Greenbaum!
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Uh oh.
                         
                          KID #1
           It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know
           what I'm gonna get him?
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           W...what?

                          GREENBAUM
           Why would Jesus want that?
                         
                          KID #2
           Get him!
                         
          The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle
          him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy
          and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           But there was one child who wasn't in
           such good spirits. Little John Bennett.
           That one boy in every neighborhood who
           just has a tough time making friends.
                         
                          JOHN
           Hey guys, can I play?
                         
          The kids all look at him.
                         
                          KID #1/#2/#3
           Get outta here! / Get outta here,
           Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!
                         
          The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
                         
          The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly
          walks back toward his house.

           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           John longed with all his heart for that
           one true friend that he could call his
           own. And he knew that if he ever found
           that friend, he would never let him go.
                         
          John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands,
          looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all
          playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing
          snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A
          WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with
          open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.

           And for little John Bennett, Christmas
           Day brought a very special new arrival.
                         
          John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a
          present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear.
          The boy holds it with delight.
                         
                          JOHN

          John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high-
          pitched "I wuv you" sound. John gasps with delight.

           John became instantly attached to Teddy.
           There was something about that bear that

           friend with whom he could share his
           deepest secrets.

          Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.

           Last week, my mom and dad took me to the
           park for a picnic. And they have this
           duck pond there, and... when nobody was
           looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it
           at a duck. Was that mean?
                         
          He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you"
          sound.

          it.

           It is an unbelievably impressive

          snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the
          clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which
          we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by
          through the opening.

          John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy,
          but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John
          bolts upright and looks around, frantically.

          He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter,
          assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the
          night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE
          FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.

          face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.

          Lori and John smile as Lori holds a big stuffed bear that
          John has won for her at a booth. Ted stands nearby, arms
          crossed, with a deep, disapproving scowl.

          laughing as Ted stands behind her (standing on something)
          covering her eyes with his paws.

          John and Lori are set for a trail ride. They are both on
          horses, wearing helmets. WIDEN TO REVEAL Ted, who also
          wears a helmet, but rides a smiling golden retriever.

          John, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf. Lori putts the
          ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup. She reacts,
          disappointed. Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing
          the ball into the cup "accidentally". Lori smiles. John
          smiles back at her. Ted winks.

          John, Lori and Ted sit outside at a table, each holding
          an ice cream cone. They stare deadpan at the camera,
          each with a dab of ice cream on their noses, and a dab of
          ice cream on their upper lips.

          INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY
          John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up
          behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and
          grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We
          ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering
          a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps
          back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall.
          He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there
          like an idiot.

          John, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with
          their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of
          Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine
          bottle on the table in front of them.

          his letters. He has spelled out the word "DOUCHE", with
          an extra B and G to spare.

          CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales,
          his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for
          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is
          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
          this is a guy who has never really given up his
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
          passes the bong to John.

          We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into
          his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he
          drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an
          overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to
          reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.

          John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot,
          scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of
          the rental cars.

          ANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to
          the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on
          the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and
          looks at the damage.

          ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch
          manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the
          doorway.

          Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the
          car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and
          another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking.

           manager. All you have to do is not fuck
           up, and all you're doing is fucking up.
           Not that I don't think you're too fucked
           up to handle not fucking up my job, but
           you happen to be the least fucked-up
           person in the whole office. The next
           least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been
           here three fucking years longer than him.
           But I'm telling you, I will promote the
           fuck out of him if you fuck up one more

          We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton
          type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a
          pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and
          a little bruised.

           There you go, here's your key and rental

           I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted
           last night, and my phone says I texted
           somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me
           up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same
           person saying thanks.

           I might be gay, I don't know. You mind
           covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go
           lay down in the john.

           It doesn't work, the name has to have a

           No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end.
           Otherwise where's the challenge? If
           there's no "ski" at the end of the root
           word, then we would just be idiots saying
           nonsense.

          Lori's boss REX (asshole handsome, mid-30's, expensive

          We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of
          dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a
          girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much
          into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is
          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the
          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,
          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force
          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts
          to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,
          when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

          She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out
          a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it
          against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.

           Hey, here's to four more years, huh?
                         
          They clink glasses, and take a sip.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Now I know we said no gifts, but--
                         
                          LORI
           No, we didn't.
                         
                          JOHN
           --But, I got you something anyway, in
           clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
                         
                          LORI
           There was no such rule.
          John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small
          box. Lori looks excited.
                         
                          JOHN
           Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for
           a long time.
                         
          John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.
                         
                          LORI
           Oh, John.
                         
          Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of
          nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
                         
                          JOHN
           Those are the ones you liked, right?
           From that kiosk at the mall?
                          LORI
           Oh. Yeah.
                         
                          JOHN
           Check out the card.
                         
          She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it.
          It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           See, I even wrote the words with
           different colored markers so you wouldn't
           get bored while you were reading it.

                          JOHN
           Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is
           so awesome, I love it!
          She reacts a bit to this.

           Someday, there's gonna be a ring in
           there. But I wanna wait `til I can get
           you something really special, y'know? I
           just don't have the money right now.
                         
                          LORI

                          JOHN
           I know, but it's important to me that you
           have the engagement ring you deserve.
           And what with the credit bubble... the
           Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
                          LORI
           Look, I'm only saying this because I love
           you, but that's not realistic. You're
           never gonna have any kind of a career if
           you're always partying and wasting time
           with Ted.

           Lori, we can't talk about this every time
           we go out. Look, he's been my best
           friend since I was eight. And I was not
           a popular child. You have to understand,
           I had no friends before he came along.
           He's the only reason I ever gained any
           fucking confidence. I coulda wound up
           like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but
           I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know,
           I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick
           him out.
                         
                          LORI
           Well, it's good to know that a talking
           teddy bear is the only thing that kept
           you from gunning down your classmates,
           but John, you're not eight. You're
           thirty-five. And unless you're too blind
           to notice, he's not your only friend
           anymore. You have me. And I love you.
                         
                          JOHN
           I love you, too. You know that.
                         
                          LORI
           Look, I've put the best physical years of
           my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now,
           but in a few years my body's gonna fall
           off a fucking cliff. Things'll be
           hanging and stretching in ways that might
           scare a man. I need to feel secure in
           the fact that you won't leave me when
           that happens.
                         
                          JOHN
           Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna
           be even better. `Cause I can have sex
           with you, and press your arm fat against
           a comic book so I can see it backwards.

           I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.
                         
                          LORI

          apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on
          the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women.
          They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very
          loudly on the TV.

           Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of
           the Nile," but I don't know that we'll
           end up watchin' that one.

          observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John
          is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they
          stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He
          seems much more interested in them than in the fish.

           I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I
           couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.

           Oh. Um, thank you.
                         
                          DONNY
           I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert.
           I have to tell you, I've been fascinated
           by your story ever since I was a boy. I
           remember seeing you on the Carson show.
           You were just wonderful.

           I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't
           for sale. I've had him since I was about
           your age. He's very special to me.
                         
                          ROBERT

           Don't swear in front of my child. Now.
           We are very interested in the bear. If
           you'd like to work out some sort of
           arrangement, here's my address and phone
           number.
                         
          He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John
          smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.

           Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the

           important stuff.
                         
          Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a
          glance back at Ted as they move off.

           slowly de-limbing you while singing some
           creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.
                         
          John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out.
          He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.

          They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame,
          slamming right into a fucking tree.

          There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes.
          John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside
          the doorway.
                          JOHN

          They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly
          turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to
          smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive-
          looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as
          the camera recedes.

           Listen... I just wanna say thank you.
           What you did with Ted was a big step, and
           I know it wasn't easy, but I just want
           you to know that I love you for it. And,
           I think this a new beginning for our

           don't end up together. You're

          pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes
          widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs
          an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl
          laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid
          sprays all over his face from one side, then from the
          other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of

          mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a
          bra on his head. John picks up.

           you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up
           the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly
           everybody talks shit about each other in
           the interviews.

           I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried
           to break up a dog fight, and I guess she
           got hurt pretty bad.

           Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she
           sees trouble, she tries to help out, and
           I guess one of these dogs clamped his
           jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let
           go until the fireman showed up and had to
           stick his finger in his ass.

                          JOHN
           Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.
                         
                          THOMAS
           You don't owe me anything, go.

           Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"?

                          (LAUGHS WARMLY)
           Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I

           king. I was king of the eighties. I was
           Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I

           scary but it was so much fun.

           how've you been? Haven't seen you in
           forever.

           Um, I've been good. Not much going on.
           My company's 20th anniversary is next
           week, that's something.

          isn't quite as delighted.

           I'm surprised John didn't tell you
           already. Seems like you guys have seen
           each other every day since you moved out.

           Well, it's funny, usually the first item
           on our agenda is "what's goin' on with
           Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped
           through the cracks.

           Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we
           were talking about... how... neat all of
           Lori's shoes are?
                         
                          TED
           That was a lengthy conversation.
                          JOHN
           And we were saying like, a lot of women
           look like unsteady horses when they wear
           high heels, but Lori has a sort of...
           regal... trot.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
          Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a
          clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to
          confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at
          Ellen's register.
                         
                          FRANK
           What the hell?
                         
          He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and
          notices him.
                         
           GUY IN LINE
           Hey, dude, you think you could open more
           than one register? There's like a
           thousand people here!
                         
                          FRANK
           There's supposed to be three registers
           open, for god's sake!
                         
          He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms
          off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's
          counter and produce area, then walk into the back
          storeroom.
                         
                         
          INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE
          ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost
          naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging
          her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away,
          with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock
          and horror.

          INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
                         
          Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.
                         
                          FRANK
           You had sexual intercourse with a
           coworker in a storeroom filled with
           produce that we sell to the public.
                         
                          TED
           Yes.
                         
                          FRANK
                          (BEAT)
           That took guts. We need guts. I'm
           promoting you.
                          TED
           Oh.
                         
                         
          EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits,
          finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the
          dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook
          shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
                         
                          TED
           Kareem!
                         
          The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           You suck, Kareem.
          We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and
          looks around. There appears to be no one in the
          darkness.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
          No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds
          nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who
          stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.
                         
                          DONNY

                          DONNY
           I can offer you six thousand dollars in
           railroad bonds. They were left to me by
           my father.
                          TED
           Well, gosh, you know, since I just
           returned from active duty in the Civil
           War, that sounds really appealing. Oh
           wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty
           years ago, and I don't give a shit.
                         
          Tami-Lynn approaches.

           Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop
           tarts and cigarettes with my mom before
           she goes to work.

           Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart.
                          (TO DONNY)
           Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I'm
           gonna have to decline.

           like to thank you for creepin' up my
           night, and... Jesus be with you. In
           Christ.
                         
          Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily
          determined.

          John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house
          in Cambridge. It's a very impressive estate with no
          expense spared.
                         
                          LORI

                          JOHN
           Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your
           boss' ass? That won't affect your
           workplace chemistry, will it?

          INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed
          servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors
          d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays
          and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and
          hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th
          Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations."

           Oh, here come the ladies.
                         
          Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs
          their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a
          tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.

          Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second
          floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought
          at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not
          like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
                         
                          REX
           ...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed
           bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for
           that at auction.
                         
                          JOHN
           Wow, cool.
                         
                          REX
           Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were
           worn by Joe Louis in his first fight.
           (passing an abstract
                          PAINTING)
           This is art. Do you get it?
           (passing wall mounted pair of
                          GLASSES) )
           These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth
           about two million dollars.
           (passing photo on wall) )
           That's me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and
           check this out.
                         
          Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand.
                         
                          REX (CONT'D)

          He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides
          across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts

          slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting
          the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie.

          ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

          Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs
          out after her.

           Lori! Lori wait!
                         
          She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John
          catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him
          off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry! I messed up! I--

           Jesus, Lori was right. I should have
           stopped hanging out with you a long time
           ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you
           around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going
           nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch
           movies with a teddy fucking bear. And
           because of that, I just lost the love of
           my life.

           (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is
           you have a fun, casual date with a guy
           who only wants a chance to prove to you
           that he can be something more than a
           jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and
           it's about time somebody treated you that
           way.

          Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him,
          wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like
          the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the
          room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles
          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,
          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.
          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted
          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted
          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John
          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,
          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.
          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be
          pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.

          Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and
          the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,
          each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).
          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling
          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the
          process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in
          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a
          number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back
          onto the bed. Ted taunts him.

          John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted
          dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the
          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about
          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,
          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the
          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted
          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles
          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing
          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the
          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,
          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He
          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the
          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks
          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,
          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.
          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over
          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing
          deteriorates into sobs.

           Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at

           Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins.
           Because I love her. This song always
           reminds me of the most important night of
           my life. The night we met. It's the
           theme song from the movie "Octopussy."

           You're an asshole!
                         
          John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at
          the last second, so the base is sticking out
          horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing
          himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and
          bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.

          The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is
          only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori
          and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the
          frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert
          security personnel haul him offstage.

           That was insane. Did you see the way

           blame you. When you think about it, it
           was actually really unfair of him to
           embarrass you like that.
                         
                          LORI
           Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed.
           Listen, John and I may have our problems
           but at least he tried. You know what? I
           don't feel like talking to you about
           this.

          still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex.
          After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori
          sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her
          towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no
          one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out
          into the hall. There's no one there.

           his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I

          The door shuts and she's gone. Ted gets up and walks
          into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.

          door. Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up.

           was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm
           ready to change. But I don't think you
           wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not
           gonna try and get you to take me back.
           Why would you? I've been a really shitty
           boyfriend for the last four years. I
           don't deserve you. I didn't take our
           relationship seriously, even though I
           love you more than life itself. All I
           want is... just to end on good terms.

           be happy... and for us to be friends.

          Donny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily
          shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in
          "Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the
          base of a bridge.

          Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps
          Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as
          shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls,
          there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings,
          photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media
          heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in
          public that Donny clearly took himself.

          Ted is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room
          with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with
          a wig stands in the corner.

           if I could have a magical teddy bear,
           too. And he said no. And I was
           heartbroken. I decided that if I ever
           had a son, I would never say no to him.

          he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching
          The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back
          into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process,
          bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick
          knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin,
          falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the
          direction of the hallway.

           Ted, are you making friends with Robert?
                         
          Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat,
          Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.
                         
                          DONNY (CONT'D)

           Okay.
          Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way
          down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's
          just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but
          notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily
          begins stapling his ear back on.

          ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in.
          Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the
          hall.

          He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to
          her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He
          shuts it off without looking at it.

          slams the door. He gets into the car.

          John looks around frantically, then spots something out
          of the passenger's side window.
                         
          JOHN'S POV - They pass the alley, where we see Donny's
          car heading out of the alleyway.
                         
                          JOHN

           Whoa whoa, stop stop stop!
                         
          The car slows down, and John sees Donny's car make the
          turn out onto the street. Ted is looking out the back.

          Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side-
          view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a U-
          turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up
          the street. Lori's car speeds up in pursuit.

          Ted continues to stare out the back. He then notices a
          crowbar on the floor in the way back. He grabs it, and
          takes a hard swing at the rear window. It does not
          break. Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat
          belt.

          Ted takes another swing at the window. The glass does
          not break. Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles
          back. He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar. He starts to
          pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to
          wriggle free.

          Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the
          window. This time, it shatters. He drops the crowbar,
          and climbs up onto the edge of the window.

          Ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the
          window, when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of
          the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor. We see
          that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar.

          of his legs.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No! You're being bad!
                         
          Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and
          brandishes it threateningly at Robert.

          Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear
          of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He
          tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori
          speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.

          Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense
          moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted
          makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and
          slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid
          falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori
          breathe energetic sighs of relief.

          Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts
          his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it
          drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's
          causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of
          Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back)
          and tumbling into the back seat.

          Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny
          captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at
          Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack.
                         
          ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from
          behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing
          himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells
          in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.

          his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window.
          He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is
          opposing traffic moving in the other direction.

          Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding
          clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori
          come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives
          through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.

          He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat.
          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted
          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing
          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap
          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few
          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted
          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,
          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in
          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering
          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles
          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but
          can't.

          Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the
          street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it
          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.
          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the
          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of
          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles
          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.
          TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.
          That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,
          and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles
          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase
          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door
          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and
          disappears inside.
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind
          Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny
          and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the
          sidewalk after them.

          Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an
          escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a
          ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red
          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs
          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his
          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him
          down a bit.
                         
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through
          the garage door, and running inside. They look around
          for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them
          (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK
          ON JOHN.

          When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one
          punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look
          down at him.

          John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert
          behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,
          but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John
          continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori
          just behind him.

          Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him.
          Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves
          past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.

          Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera
          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of
          FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one
          lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from
          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints
          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He
          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted
          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto
          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's
          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't
          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,
          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.
          Ted climbs farther up the tower.

          John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant
          lighting tower.
                         
                          JOHN

          He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the
          concession area.

          Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls
          back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when
          Donny grabs one of his legs.

          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he
          can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from
          earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -
          His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with
          fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows
          this is not good...

          The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself
          free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we
          see his vision swimming even more.

          but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.

          Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his
          depleted strength to pull himself farther up.

          John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over
          toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...
                         
                         
          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the
          foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP,
          Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted
          falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white
          stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand
          over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with
          the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging,
          stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling
          himself back over the ledge.
                         
          We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the
          stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the
          edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well.
          ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the
          upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren,
          and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car
          pull up far below, he makes a break for it.

          Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking
          around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom
          there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side,
          and kneel down.

          thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to
          sew him up as John watches intently.

          wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower

          the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes
          it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part
          of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his

           It... it was you. You did it. (cover

                          LORI
           No. I wished for my life back. Because
           I love you both.
                         
          John goes to her, and kisses her passionately.

           And so John, Lori, and Ted lived happily
           ever after, having discovered at last
           that all they really needed was each
           other. John and Lori were married in a
           beautiful ceremony in Cambridge, by a
           very special Justice of the Peace.

          We hear the Flash Gordon Wedding March as we ANGLE ON Sam
          J. Jones standing in robes at the altar. Ted, in a tux,
          stands in the best man's position. John stands on the
          steps smiling and looking out as we cut to...
                         
          ANGLE ON Lori, walking down the aisle in a wedding dress,
          smiling warmly. TIME CUT to shortly after, as Sam Jones
          addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.
                         
                          SAM JONES
           I now pronounce you man and wife. You
           may kiss the bride.
                         
          John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the
          cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves
          back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing
          pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,
          John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix
          and Tanya, etc.).

          John and Lori come running out of the church, as the
          crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo
          with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in,
          and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,
          Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns
          and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into
          frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as
          Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her
          off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...
                         
          Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as
          his best friend heads off.

           Ted and Tami-Lynn continued their torrid
           love affair for quite some time. One
           afternoon Ted was caught behind the deli
           counter eating potato salad off of Tami-

           promoted to store manager.
