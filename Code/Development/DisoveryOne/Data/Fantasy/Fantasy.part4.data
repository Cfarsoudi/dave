               NIGHT SEQUENCE

               Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town 
               of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets 
               are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over 
               the above scenes we hear voices praying:

                                     GOWER'S VOICE
                         I owe everything to George Bailey. 
                         Help him, dear Father.

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                         Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend 
                         Mr. Bailey.

                                     MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE
                         Help my son George tonight.

                                     BERT'S VOICE
                         He never thinks about himself, God; 
                         that's why he's in trouble.

                                     ERNIE'S VOICE
                         George is a good guy. Give him a 
                         break, God.

                                     MARY'S VOICE
                         I love him, dear Lord. Watch over 
                         him tonight.

                                     JANIE'S VOICE
                         Please, God. Something's the matter 
                         with Daddy.

                                     ZUZU'S VOICE
                         Please bring Daddy back.

               CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through 
               the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly 
               toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we 
               hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice 
               is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Hello, Joseph, trouble?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Looks like we'll have to send someone 
                         down  a lot of people are asking 
                         for help for a man named George 
                         Bailey.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his 
                         crucial night. You're right, we'll 
                         have to send someone down immediately. 
                         Whose turn is it?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's why I came to see you, sir. 
                         It's that clock-maker's turn again.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings 
                         yet, has he? We've passed him up 
                         right along.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Because, you know, sir, he's got the 
                         I.Q. of a rabbit.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Yes, but he's got the faith of a 
                         child  simple. Joseph, send for 
                         Clarence.

               A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It 
               twinkles as Clarence speaks:

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         You sent for me, sir?

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth 
                         needs our help.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Splendid! Is he sick?

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         No, worse. He's discouraged. At 
                         exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, 
                         Earth time, that man will be thinking 
                         seriously of throwing away God's 
                         greatest gift.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've 
                         only got an hour to dress. What are 
                         they wearing now?

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         You will spend that hour getting 
                         acquainted with George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Sir... If I should accomplish this 
                         mission  I mean  might I perhaps 
                         win my wings?  I've been waiting for 
                         over two hundred years now, sir  
                         and people are beginning to talk.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         What's that book you've got there?

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Clarence, you do a good job with 
                         George Bailey, and you'll get your 
                         wings.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Poor George... Sit down.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Sit down? What are...

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         If you're going to help a man, you 
                         want to know something about him, 
                         don't you?

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Well, naturally. Of course.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Well, keep your eyes open. See the 
                         town?

               The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, 
               indistinguishable blur is seen.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Where? I don't see a thing.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your 
                         wings yet. Now look, I'll help you 
                         out.  Concentrate. Begin to see 
                         something?

               The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a 
               group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Why, yes. This is amazing.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         If you ever get your wings, you'll 
                         see all by yourself.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, wonderful!

               EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT

               Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on 
               large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out 
               onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.

                                     BOY
                              (as he slides)
                         Yippee!!

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Hey, who's that?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's your problem, George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         A boy?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's him when he was twelve, back 
                         in 1919. Something happens here you'll 
                         have to remember later on.

               Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the 
               hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others 
               applaud.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George Bailey at bottom of slide.

                                     GEORGE
                              (through megaphone)
                         And here comes the scare-baby, my 
                         kid brother, Harry Bailey.

               CLOSE SHOT  HARRY

               On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.

                                     HARRY
                         I'm not scared.

                                     BOYS
                              (ad lib)
                         Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by 
               the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice 
               at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears 
               into the water.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm coming, Harry.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to 
               pull him out he yells:

                                     GEORGE
                         Make a chain, gang! A chain!

               WIDER ANGLE

               The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. 
               When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they 
               pull them both to safety.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         George saved his brother's life that 
                         day.  But he caught a bad cold which 
                         infected his left ear. Cost him his 
                         hearing in that ear. It was weeks 
                         before he could return to his after-
                         school job at old man Gower's 
                         drugstore.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, 
               whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate 
               horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the 
               street.

               MEDIUM PAN SHOT

               The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly 
               man riding in it.

               CLOSE SHOT

               The boys watching the carriage.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Potter!

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Who's that  a king?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's Henry F. Potter, the richest 
                         and meanest man in the county.

               The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The 
               drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored 
               water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:

                                     GEORGE
                         So long!

                                     BOYS
                              (ad lib)
                         Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee-
                         haw.

               INTERIOR DRUGSTORE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter 
               on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:

                                     GEORGE
                         Wish I had a million dollars.

               He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog!

               WIDER ANGLE

               George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, 
               a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get 
               his apron from behind the fountain.

                                     GEORGE
                              (calling toward back 
                              room)
                         It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools 
               at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same 
               age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.

                                     VIOLET
                              (with warm friendliness)
                         Hello, George.
                              (then, flatly, as she 
                              sees Mary)
                         'Lo, Mary.

                                     MARY
                              (primly)
                         Hello, Violet.

               George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are 
               two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy 
               counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Two cents worth of shoelaces?

                                     VIOLET
                         She was here first.

                                     MARY
                         I'm still thinking.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Violet)
                         Shoelaces?

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Georgie.

               George goes over to the candy counter.

                                     VIOLET
                              (to Mary)
                         I like him.

                                     MARY
                         You like every boy.

                                     VIOLET
                              (happily)
                         What's wrong with that?

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are.

               George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice 
               shoelaces.  Violet gives him the money.

                                     VIOLET
                              (the vamp)
                         Help me down?

                                     GEORGE
                              (disgusted)
                         Help you down!

               Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, 
               sticks out her tongue as she passes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Made up your mind yet?

                                     MARY
                         I'll take chocolate.

               George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.

                                     GEORGE
                         With coconuts?

                                     MARY
                         I don't like coconuts.

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't like coconuts!  Say, 
                         brainless, don't you know where 
                         coconuts come from?  Lookit here  
                         from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral 
                         Sea!

               He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.

                                     MARY
                         A new magazine! I never saw it before.

                                     GEORGE
                         Of course you never. Only us explorers 
                         can get it. I've been nominated for 
                         membership in the National Geographic 
                         Society.

               He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf 
               ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary, whispering.

                                     MARY
                         Is this the ear you can't hear on? 
                         George Bailey, I'll love you till 
                         the day I die.

               She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she 
               has said.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going out exploring some day, 
                         you watch. And I'm going to have a 
                         couple of harems, and maybe three or 
                         four wives.  Wait and see.

               He turns back to the cash register, whistling.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. 
               Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, 
               chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It 
               is evident he has been drinking.

                                     GOWER
                         George! George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     GOWER
                         You're not paid to be a canary.

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir.

               He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open 
               telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he 
               starts to read it.

               INSERT: THE TELEGRAM

               It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, 
               died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything 
               possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions 
               from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE."

               BACK TO SHOT

               George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses 
               itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the 
               ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward 
               Gower.

               INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT

               Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower, do you want something...  
                         Anything?

                                     GOWER
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         Anything I can do back here?

                                     GOWER
                         No.

               George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite 
               drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the 
               floor.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.

               BACK TO SHOT

               George and Gower.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'll get them, sir.

               He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower 
               waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in 
               his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. 
               George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the 
               powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George 
               stands still, horrified.

                                     GOWER
                         Take these capsules over to Mrs. 
                         Blaine's.  She's waiting for them.

               George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or 
               say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. 
               George's fingers fumble.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria 
                         there, haven't they, sir?

                                     GOWER
                         Ummmm...

               Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns 
               to him, the box in his hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is it a charge, sir?

                                     GOWER
                         Yes  charge.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower, I think...

                                     GOWER
                         Aw, get going!

                                     GEORGE

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he 
               sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says:

               "ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL

               BACK TO SHOT

               With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the 
               street. Mary follows him with her eyes.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-
               story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building 
               and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting 
               at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.

               INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY

               FULL SHOT

               The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There 
               is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a 
               door marked:

               "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, 
               obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a 
               very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With 
               him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a 
               waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and 
               Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with 
               an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly 
               toward his father's office.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to 
               enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where 
                         you headin'?

                         Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Some other time, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         It's important.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         There's a squall in there that's 
                         shapin' up into a storm.

               During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, 
               and now she calls out:

               Uncle Billy looking at his hand.

                         him yesterday. Switch it inside.

               He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George 
               stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs 
               of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more 
               keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his 
               father's office and enters.

               INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing 
               swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle 
               man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other 
               people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind 
               which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits 
               Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The 
               following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument 
               had been in process for some time.

                                     BAILEY
                         I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

                                     POTTER
                         Well, you're begging, and that's a 
                         whole lot worse.

                                     BAILEY
                         All I'm asking is thirty days more...

                              (to Potter)
                         Just thirty short days. I'll dig up 
                         that five thousand somehow.

                         Shove me up...

               Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.

                         Have you put any real pressure on 
                         those people of yours to pay those 
                         mortgages?

                                     BAILEY
                         Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of 
                         these people are out of work.

                                     POTTER
                         Then foreclose!

                         I can't do that. These families have 
                         children.

                         But they're somebody's children.

                                     BAILEY
                         Mr. Potter, what makes you such a 
                         hardskulled character? You have no 
                         family  no children. You can't begin 
                         to spend all the money you've got.

                                     POTTER
                         So I suppose I should give it to 
                         miserable failures like you and that 
                         idiot brother of yours to spend for 
                         me.

               George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his 
               father. He comes around in front of the desk.

                                     GEORGE
                         He's not a failure! You can't say 
                         that about my father!

                                     BAILEY
                         George, George...

                                     GEORGE
                         You're not! You're the biggest man 
                         in town!

                                     BAILEY
                         Run along.

               He pushes George toward the door.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bigger'n him!

               As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's 
               shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bigger'n everybody.

               George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on 
               his shoulder. As they go:

                                     BAILEY

                         you tonight.

               Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. 
               George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

                              (drunkenly)
                         Why, that medicine should have been 
                         there an hour ago. It'll be over in 
                         five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

               He hangs up the phone and turns to George.

                         Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

               He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back 
               room.

                                     GEORGE

                         Yes, sir, I...

               Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open 
               hands.  George tries to protect himself as best he can.

                                     GOWER
                         What kind of tricks are you playing,

                         right away? Don't you know that boy's

                              (sobbing)
                         Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're 
                         doing. You put something wrong in 
                         those capsules. I know you're unhappy. 
                         You got that telegram, and you're 
                         upset. You put something bad in those 
                         capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. 
                         Gower...

               George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely 
               rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy 
               venomously.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just look and see what you did. Look 
                         at the bottle you took the powder 
                         from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's 
                         poison!  I know you feel bad... and...

               George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower 
               looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced 
               on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder 
               out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then 
               abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to 
               look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. 
               Gower steps toward him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't hurt my sore ear again.

               But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, 
               sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is 
               crying too.

                                     GOWER
                         No... No... No...

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't hurt my ear again!

                         Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. 
                         I know what you're feeling. I won't 
                         ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I 
                         won't.

               INT. LUGGAGE SHOP  DAY  (1928)

               MEDIUM SHOT

               It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an 
               assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, 
               the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase.

                                     JOE
                         An overnight bag  genuine English 
                         cowhide, combination lock, fitted up 
                         with brushes, combs...

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Nope.

               AS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our 
               first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP 
               to a CLOSEUP by now.

                                     GEORGE
                         Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, 
                         Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big 
                         one.

               Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms 
               outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes 
               a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from 
               Heaven:

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         What did you stop it for?

                         I want you to take a good look at 
                         that face.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Who is it?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, you mean the kid that had his 
                         ears slapped back by the druggist.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's the kid.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         It's a good face. I like it. I like 
                         George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever 
                         tell anyone about the pills?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Not a soul.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Did he ever marry the girl? Did he 
                         ever go exploring?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Well, wait and see.

               CLOSE SHOT  THE SCREEN

               The arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again.

                                     GEORGE
                         Big - see!  I don't want one for one 
                         night.  I want something for a 
                         thousand and one nights, with plenty 
                         of room for labels from Italy and 
                         Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big 
                         one. 

                                     JOE
                         I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't 
                         suppose you'd like this old second-
                         hand job, would you?

               He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could 
                         use this as a raft in case the boat 
                         sunk. How much does this cost?

                                     JOE
                         No charge.

                                     GEORGE
                         That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded 
                         as if you said no charge.

                                     JOE

                              (as he sees his name)
                         What's my name doing on it?

                                     JOE
                         A little present from old man Gower. 
                         Came down and picked it out himself.

                                     GEORGE
                              (admiring the bag)
                         He did? Whatta you know about that  
                         my old boss...

                                     JOE
                         What boat you sailing on?

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm working across on a cattle boat.

                                     JOE
                         A cattle boat?

                                     GEORGE
                              (as he exits)
                         Okay, I like cows.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The place is practically the same except that it is now full 
               of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little 
               tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the 
               local small fry.  There are now three kids jerking sodas.  
               Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored. 
               He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face 
               lights up when he sees George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks 
                         ever so much for the bag. It's just 
                         exactly what I wanted.

                                     GOWER
                         Aw, forget it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, it's wonderful.

                                     GOWER
                         Hope you enjoy it.

               George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter. 
               He closes his eyes and makes a wish.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... Oh. Wish I had a million 
                         dollars.

               As he snaps the lighter the flame springs up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog!

               George shakes Gower's hand vigorously and exits.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  DAY

               PAN SHOT as George crosses the street, Uncle Billy, cousin 
               Tilly and Cousin Eustace are leaning out of the second floor 
               window of the Building and Loan offices.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Avast there, Captain Cook. You got 
                         your sea legs yet?

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                         Parlez-vous francais? Hey, send us 
                         some of them picture postcards, will 
                         you, George?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Hey, George, don't take any plugged 
                         nickels.

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                         Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.  
                         George waves up at them and continues 
                         on across the street.

               EXT. MAIN STREET  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               As George crosses the street. He spots Ernie and his cab, 
               and Bert the motor cop, parked alongside.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Ernie!

                                     ERNIE
                         Hiya, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Hi, Bert.

                                     BERT
                         George...

                                     GEORGE
                         Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How 
                         about driving me home in style?

               Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase 
               inside.

                                     ERNIE
                         Sure, your highness, hop in. And, 
                         for the carriage trade, I puts on my 
                         hat.

               As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he 
               sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward 
               him. Her walk and figure would stop anybody. She gives him a 
               sultry look.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               The three men by the cab, but including Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. 
                         That's some dress you got on there.

               CLOSE SHOT  VIOLET

               She reacts to this.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, this old thing? Why, I only wear 
                         it when I don't care how I look.

               CAMERA PANS WITH HER AS VIOLET SWINGS ON DOWN THE SIDEWALK.

               REVERSE SHOT  CAB

               As Violet goes by, George and Bert raise their heads above 
               the top of the cab.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               On Violet's back as she goes. As she crosses the street, an 
               elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car 
               that pulls up with screeching brakes.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND BERT AT CAB

               Ernie sticks his head out form the driver's seat.

                                     ERNIE
                         How would you like...

                                     GEORGE
                              (as he enters cab)
                         Yes...

                                     ERNIE
                         Want to come along, Bert?  We'll 
                         show you the town!

               Bert looks at his watch, then takes another look at Violet's 
               retreating figure.

                                     BERT
                         No, thanks. Think I'll go home and 
                         see what the wife's doing.

                                     ERNIE
                         Family man.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAILEY DINING ROOM  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table. Mrs. Bailey and 
               Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling. There 
               are SOUNDS of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs. Annie 
               pounds on the ceiling with a broom.

                                     MOTHER
                              (calling out)
                         George! Harry! You're shaking the 
                         house down! Stop it!

                                     POP
                         Oh, let 'em alone. I wish I was up 
                         there with them.

                                     MOTHER
                         Harry'll tear his dinner suit. George!

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Mrs. Bailey is calling up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's why all children should be 
                         girls.

                                     MOTHER
                         But if they were all girls, there 
                         wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
                              (calling upstairs)
                         George! Harry! Come down to dinner 
                         this minute. Everything's getting 
                         cold and you know we've been waiting 
                         for you.

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         Okay, Mom.

               She goes up the stairs.  Pop is smiling and poking his plate. 
               A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare 
               MUSIC. Down they come, holding their mother high between 
               them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and 
               deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap.

                                     BOYS
                         Here's a present for you, Pop.

               Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns 
               with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down 
                         and have dinner.

                                     HARRY
                         I've eaten.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well, aren't you going to finish 
                         dressing for your graduation party? 
                         Look at you.

                                     HARRY
                         I don't care. It's George's tux.

               Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out 
               for her.

                                     ANNIE
                         If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit 
                         you with this broom.

                                     HARRY
                         Annie, I'm in love with you. There's 
                         a moon out tonight.

               As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny. 
               She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George 
               and his mother sit down at the table.

                                     GEORGE
                         Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal 
                         at the old Bailey boarding house.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door.

                                     HARRY
                         Pop, can I have the car? I'm going 
                         to take over a lot of plates and 
                         things.

                                     MOTHER
                         What plates?

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats 
                         committee and we only need a couple 
                         of dozen.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my 
                         best Haviland.

               She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. 
               As she goes:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and his father, eating at the table. There is a great 
               similarity and a great understanding between them.

                                     POP
                         Hope you have a good trip, George. 
                         Uncle Billy and I are going to miss 
                         you.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. 
                         What's the matter? You look tired.

                                     POP
                         Oh, I had another tussle with Potter 
                         today.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

                                     POP
                         I thought when we put him on the 
                         Board of Directors, he'd ease up on 
                         us a little bit.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wonder what's eating that old money 
                         grubbing buzzard anyway?

                                     POP
                         Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and 
                         sick.  Sick in his mind, sick in his 
                         soul, if he has one. Hates everybody 
                         that has anything that he can't have. 
                         Hates us mostly, I guess.

               The dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, 
               Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his 
               head.  CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross.

                                     HARRY
                         Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.

                                     POP
                         So long, son.

                                     GEORGE
                         Got a match?

                                     HARRY
                         Very funny. Very funny.

                                     MOTHER
                         Put those things in the car and I'll 
                         get your tie and studs together.

                                     HARRY
                         Okay, Mom. You coming later? You 
                         coming later, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, and be bored to 
                         death?

                                     HARRY
                         Couldn't want a better death. Lots 
                         of pretty girls, and we're going to 
                         use that new floor of yours tonight, 
                         too.

                                     GEORGE
                         I hope it works.

                                     POP
                         No gin tonight, son.

                                     HARRY
                         Aw, Pop, just a little.

                                     POP
                         No, son, not one drop.

               George and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes.

                                     ANNIE
                         Boys and girls and music. Why do 
                         they need gin?

               She exits.

                                     GEORGE
                         Father, did I act like that when I 
                         graduated from high school?

                                     POP
                         Pretty much. You know, George, wish 
                         we could send Harry to college with 
                         you. Your mother and I talked it 
                         over half the night.

                                     GEORGE
                         We have that all figured out. You 
                         see, Harry'll take my job at the 
                         Building and Loan, work there four 
                         years, then he'll go.

                                     POP
                         He's pretty young for that job.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, no younger than I was.

                                     POP
                         Maybe you were born older, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

                                     POP
                         I say, maybe you were born older. I 
                         suppose you've decided what you're 
                         going to do when you get out of 
                         college.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, well, you know what I've always 
                         talked about  build things... design 
                         new buildings  plan modern cities  
                         all that stuff I was talking about.

                                     POP
                         Still after that first million before 
                         you're thirty.

                                     GEORGE
                         No, I'll settle for half that in 
                         cash.

               Annie comes in again from the kitchen.

                                     POP
                         Of course, it's just a hope, but you 
                         wouldn't consider coming back to the 
                         Building and Loan, would you?

               Annie stops serving to hear his answer.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I...
                              (to Annie)
                         Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?  
                         Then you'd be more comfortable and 
                         you could hear everything that's 
                         going on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I would if I thought I'd hear anything 
                         worth listening to.

                                     GEORGE
                         You would, huh?

               She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. 
               Bailey smiles and turns to George.

                                     POP
                         I know it's soon to talk about it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't 
                         face being cooped up for the rest of 
                         my life in a shabby little office.

               He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean 
                         that remark, but this business of 
                         nickels and dimes and spending all 
                         your life trying to figure out how 
                         to save three cents on a length of 
                         pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do 
                         something big and something important.

                                     POP
                              (quietly)
                         You know, George, I feel that in a 
                         small way we are doing something 
                         important.  Satisfying a fundamental 
                         urge. It's deep in the race for a 
                         man to want his own roof and walls 
                         and fireplace, and we're helping him 
                         get those things in our shabby little 
                         office.

                                     GEORGE
                              (unhappily)
                         I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But 
                         I've been hoarding pennies like a 
                         miser in order to... Most of my 
                         friends have already finished college. 
                         I just feel like if I don't get away, 
                         I'd bust.

                                     POP
                         Yes... Yes... You're right, son.

                                     GEORGE
                         You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

                                     POP
                         This town is no place for any man 
                         unless he's willing to crawl to 
                         Potter. You've got talent, son. You 
                         get yourself an education. Then get 
                         out of here.

                                     GEORGE
                         Pop, do you want a shock? I think 
                         you're a great guy.

               To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door 
               and calls:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Annie listening through glass in door.

                                     ANNIE
                         I heard it. About time one of you 
                         lunkheads said it.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and his father at the table.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I 
                         think I'll get dressed and go over 
                         to Harry's party.

                                     POP
                         Have a good time, son.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               At one end of the room an orchestra is playing. George wends 
               his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table. 
               He and Harry are carrying plates and pies.

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are.

               Several of the boys take the plates from him. George looks 
               at them, feeling very grown up and out of place.

                                     HARRY
                              (introducing George)
                         You know my kid brother, George. I'm 
                         going to put him through college.

               Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at 
               his ears as he talks.

                                     SAM
                         Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!

               George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including Sam and Marty Hatch. Sam is assured and breezy, 
               wearing very collegiate clothes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? 
                         When did you get here?

                                     SAM
                         Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd 
                         give the kids a treat.

                                     GEORGE
                         Old college graduate now, huh?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, 
                         they call me. Well, freshman, looks 
                         like you're going to make it after 
                         all.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yep.

               Sam sees Harry and leaves George in the middle of a gesture.

                                     SAM
                              (to Harry)
                         Harry! You're the guy I want to see. 
                         Coach has heard all about you.

                                     HARRY
                         He has?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah. He's followed every game and 
                         his mouth's watering. He wants me to 
                         find out if you're going to come 
                         along with us.

                                     HARRY
                         Well, I gotta make some dough first.

                                     SAM
                         Well, you better make it fast. We 
                         need great ends like you  not broken 
                         down old guys like this one.

               George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting 
               each other.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hee-haw!

                                     SAM
                         Hee-haw!

               An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         George, welcome back.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Putting a pool under this floor was 
                         a great idea. Saved us another 
                         building.  Now, Harry, Sam, have a 
                         lot of fun.  There's lots of stuff 
                         to eat and drink.  Lots of pretty 
                         girls around.

               Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George. 
               She is waving her dance program at him.

                         Hey, George...

                         Hello, Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, what am I bid?

               Marty Hatch enters scene.

                                     MARTY
                         George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home 
                         week.

                                     MARTY
                         Do me a favor, will you, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     MARTY
                         Well, you remember my kid sister, 
                         Mary?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, yeah, yeah.

                                     SAM
                         "Momma wants you, Marty." "Momma 
                         wants you, Marty." Remember?

                                     MARTY
                         Dance with her, will you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny 
                         enough already, with all these kids.

                                     MARTY
                         Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance 
                         with her one time and you'll give 
                         her the thrill of her life.

                                     SAM
                         Aw, go on.

                                     MARTY
                              (calling off)
                         Hey, sis.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be 
                         long, Marty. I don't want to be a 
                         wet nurse for...

               He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her.

               CLOSEUP  MARY HATCH

               She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass 
               of punch in her hand. For the first time, she is wearing an 
               evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration 
               of the boy with her. She turns around and for the first time 
               she sees George.  For a second she loses her poise, staring 
               at him.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         And the next thing I know, some guy 
                         came up and tripped me. That's the 
                         reason why I came in fourth. If it 
                         hadn't been for that...

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, staring at Mary.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         ...that race would have been a cinch. 
                         I tried to find out who it was 
                         later...

               CLOSEUP  MARY

               Still staring at George, and smiling.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd 
                         ever tell you whoever it was because 
                         they'd be scared. They know...

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George.

                                     FREDDIE
                         ...what kind of...

                                     MARTY
                              (interrupting)
                         You remember George? This is Mary. 
                         Well, I'll be seeing you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well... Well... Well...

                                     FREDDIE
                         Now, to get back to my story, see...

               Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start 
               dancing.

                                     FREDDIE
                         Hey, this is my dance!

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, why don't you stop annoying 
                         people?

                                     FREDDIE
                         Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

               MOVING SHOT

               Following George and Mary as they dance.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, hello.

                                     MARY
                         Hello. You look at me as if you didn't 
                         know me.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I don't.

                                     MARY
                         You've passed me on the street almost 
                         every day.

                                     GEORGE
                         Me?

                                     MARY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-uh. That was a little girl named 
                         Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

               A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand.

                                     HARRY
                         Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big 
                         Charleston contest. The prize? A 
                         genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped 
                         by the judges will remain on the 
                         floor. Let's go!

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

               As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, 
               they look at each other.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm not very good at this.

                                     MARY
                         Neither am I.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay  what can we lose?

               They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of 
               various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad.

               CLOSEUP  FREDDIE

               Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking 
               daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too 
               many, is beside him.

                                     MICKEY
                         What's the matter, Othello  jealous? 
                         Did you know there's a swimming pool 
                         under this floor? And did you know 
                         that button behind you causes this 
                         floor to open up?  And did you further 
                         know that George Bailey is dancing 
                         right over that crack?  And I've got 
                         the key?

               Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns 
               the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each 
               half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. 
               Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so 
               engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers 
               and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals 
               an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are 
               so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. 
               Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for 
               cheers.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary dancing.

                                     GEORGE
                         They're cheering us. We must be good.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move 
               backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and 
               fall into the pool below.

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the 
               crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap 
               into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally 
               clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George 
               is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants 
               that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath 
               robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle 
               that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera 
               we hear them singing:

                                     GEORGE AND MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals can't you come out 
                         tonight.  Can't you come out tonight. 
                         Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo 
                         Gals can't you come out tonight and 
                         dance by the light of the moon.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog! Just like an organ.

                                     MARY
                         Beautiful.

               CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         And I told Harry I thought I'd be 
                         bored to death. You should have seen 
                         the commotion in that locker room. I 
                         had to knock down three people to 
                         get this stuff we're wearing here. 
                         Here, let me hold that old wet dress 
                         of yours.

               He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look 
               at each other.

                                     MARY
                         Do I look as funny as you do?

                                     GEORGE
                         I guess I'm not quite the football 
                         type.  You... look wonderful. You 
                         know, if it wasn't me talking I'd 
                         say you were the prettiest girl in 
                         town.

                                     MARY
                         Well, why don't you say it?

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know. Maybe I will say it. 
                         How old are you anyway?

                                     MARY
                         Eighteen.

                                     GEORGE
                         Eighteen? Why, it was only last year 
                         you were seventeen.

                                     MARY
                         Too young or too old?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits 
                         you.  Yes, sir, you look a little 
                         older without your clothes on.

               Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly 
               on:

                                     GEORGE
                         I mean, without a dress. You look 
                         older...  I mean, younger. You look 
                         just...

               In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's 
               bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers 
               the robe around her.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh-oh...

                                     MARY
                              (holding out her hand)
                         Sir, my train, please.

                                     GEORGE
                         A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

               He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm.

                                     GEORGE
                         Your... your caboose, my lady.

                                     MARY
                         You may kiss my hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Ummmmm...

               Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey  hey, Mary.

               Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals":

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         As I was lumbering down the street...

               George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the 
                         old Granville house.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE

               It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that 
               once was no doubt resplendent.

                                     GEORGE
                         No. You see, you make a wish and 
                         then try and break some glass. You 
                         got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, 
                         too.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of 
                         romance, that old place. I'd like to 
                         live in it.

                                     GEORGE
                         In that place?

                                     MARY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. 
                         Now watch... right on the second 
                         floor there.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE

               George hurls the rock at the house. We hear the SOUND of a 
               window breaking.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair 
               on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass.

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         What'd you wish, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, not just one wish. A whole 
                         hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going 
                         to do tomorrow and the next day and 
                         the next year and the year after 
                         that. I'm shaking the dust of this 
                         crummy little town off my feet and 
                         I'm going to see the world. Italy, 
                         Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. 
                         Then I'm coming back here and go to 
                         college and see what they know... 
                         and then I'm going to build things. 
                         I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm 
                         gonna build skyscrapers a hundred 
                         stories high. I'm gonna build bridges 
                         a mile long...

               As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally 
               stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Are you gonna throw a rock?

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more 
               we hear the SOUND of breaking glass.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you 
                         wish, Mary?

               Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off 
               down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after 
               her.

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals, can't you come out 
                         tonight...

               George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the 
               street.

                                     MARY AND GEORGE
                              (singing)
                         ...can't you come out tonight, can't 
                         you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals 
                         can't you come out tonight and dance 
                         by the light of the moon.

                                     GEORGE
                         What'd you wish when you threw that 
                         rock?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

               They have stopped walking and now face one another.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no.

                                     GEORGE
                         Come on, tell me.

                                     MARY
                         If I told you it might not come true.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is it you want, Mary? What do 
                         you want? You want the moon? Just 
                         say...

               LONG SHOT

               Full moon shining through the trees.

               BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         ...the word and I'll throw a lasso 
                         around it and pull it down. Hey, 
                         that's a pretty good idea. I'll give 
                         you the moon, Mary.

                                     MARY
                         I'll take it. And then what?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, then you could swallow it and 
                         it'd all dissolve, see? And the 
                         moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers 
                         and your toes, and the ends of your 
                         hair.
                              (pauses)
                         Am I talking too much?

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH OF HOUSE

               As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair:

                                     MAN
                         Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead 
                         of talking her to death?

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH

                                     MAN
                         Why don't you kiss her instead of 
                         talking her to death?

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         Want me to kiss her, huh?

               CLOSE SHOT  PORCH OF HOUSE

                                     MAN
                         Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong 
                         people.

               As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his 
               house, slamming the front door.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come 
                         on back out here, and I'll show you 
                         some kissing that'll put hair back 
                         on your head. What are you...

               Mary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on 
               the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes 
               off.

                                     GEORGE
                              (looking around)
                         Mary...

               He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He 
               cannot see her anywhere.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, I give up. Where are you?

               CLOSEUP  BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK

               We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves.

                                     MARY
                         Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

               George walks toward the bush.

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are. Catch.

               He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes 
               him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Wait a minute. What am I doing? This 
                         is a very interesting situation.

                                     MARY
                              (from the bushes)
                         Please give me my robe.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmm... A man doesn't get in a 
                         situation like this every day.

                                     MARY
                              (impatiently)
                         I'd like to have my robe.

                                     GEORGE
                         Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

               Mary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say:

                                     MARY
                         Ouch!

                                     GEORGE
                         Gesundheit. This requires a little 
                         thought here.

                                     MARY
                              (getting mad)
                         George Bailey! Give me my robe!

                                     GEORGE
                         I've heard about things like this, 
                         but I've never...

                                     MARY
                              (interrupting)
                         Shame on you. I'm going to tell your 
                         mother on you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, my mother's way up the corner 
                         there.

                                     MARY
                              (desperate)
                         I'll call the police.

                                     GEORGE
                         They're way downtown. They'd be on 
                         my side, too.

                                     MARY
                         I'm going to scream!

                                     GEORGE
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's 
                         see. No, the point is, in order to 
                         get this robe...  I've got it! I'll 
                         make a deal with you, Mary.

               Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile 
               drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside 
               him.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         George! George! Come on home, quick! 
                         Your father's had a stroke!

               George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the 
               car.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to 
                         go.

                                     HARRY
                         Come on, George, let's hurry.

                                     GEORGE
                         Did you get a doctor?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Yes, Campbell's there now.

               CLOSEUP  THE HYDRANGEA BUSH

               As the car drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises up 
               from the bush and follows the car with her eyes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING

               There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. 
               They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. 
               Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate 
               salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. 
               Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George 
               are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is 
               Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on 
               which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors 
               there are individual reports for them to study.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         I think that's all we'll need you 
                         for, George. I know you're anxious 
                         to make a train.

                                     GEORGE
                              (rising)
                         I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         I want the Board to know that George 
                         gave up his trip to Europe to help 
                         straighten things out here these 
                         past few months.  Good luck to you 
                         at school, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thanks.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         Now we come to the real purpose of 
                         this meeting  to appoint a successor 
                         to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

                                     POTTER
                         Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my 
                         real purpose.

                                     MAN
                         Wait just a minute now.

                                     POTTER
                         Wait for what?  I claim this 
                         institution is not necessary to this 
                         town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I 
                         make a motion to dissolve this 
                         institution and turn its assets and 
                         liabilities over to the receiver.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (angrily)
                         George, you hear what that buzzard...

                                     LAWYER
                         Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after 
                         Peter Bailey's death to discuss 
                         chloroforming the Building and Loan.

                                     MAN
                         Peter Bailey died three months ago. 
                         I second Mr. Potter's motion.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         Very well. In that case I'll ask the 
                         two executive officers to withdraw.

               Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy 
               start to collect their papers and leave the table.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         But before you go, I'm sure the whole 
                         board wishes to express its deep 
                         sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thank you very much.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         It was his faith and devotion that 
                         are responsible for this organization.

                                     POTTER
                         I'll go further than that. I'll say 
                         that to the public Peter Bailey was 
                         the Building and Loan.

               Everyone looks at him surprised.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (trying to control 
                              himself)
                         Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from 
                         you, considering that you probably 
                         drove him to his grave.

                                     POTTER
                         Peter Bailey was not a business man.  
                         That's what killed him. Oh, I don't 
                         mean any disrespect to him, God rest 
                         his soul.  He was a man of high 
                         ideals, so-called, but ideals without 
                         common sense can ruin this town.
                              (picking up papers 
                              from table)
                         Now, you take this loan here to Ernie 
                         Bishop... You know, that fellow that 
                         sits around all day on his brains in 
                         his taxi.  You know... I happen to 
                         know the bank turned down this loan, 
                         but he comes here and we're building 
                         him a house worth five thousand 
                         dollars. Why?

               George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and 
               papers, ready to leave.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. 
                         You have all the papers there. His 
                         salary, insurance. I can personally 
                         vouch for his character.

                                     POTTER
                              (sarcastically)
                         A friend of yours?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         You see, if you shoot pool with some 
                         employee here, you can come and borrow 
                         money. What does that get us? A 
                         discontented, lazy rabble instead of 
                         a thrifty working class. And all 
                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers 
                         like Peter Bailey stir them up and 
                         fill their heads with a lot of 
                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...

               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, 
               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just a minute  just a minute. Now, 
                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right 
                         when you say my father was no business 
                         man. I know that. Why he ever started 
                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and 
                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither 
                         you nor anybody else can say anything 
                         against his character, because his 
                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-
                         five years since he and Uncle Billy 
                         started this thing, he never once 
                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, 
                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough 
                         money to send Harry to school, let 
                         alone me. But he did help a few people 
                         get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. 
                         And what's wrong with that? Why...  
                         Here, you're all businessmen here. 
                         Doesn't it make them better citizens? 
                         Doesn't it make them better customers? 
                         You... you said... What'd you say 
                         just a minute ago?... They had to 
                         wait and save their money before 
                         they even ought to think of a decent 
                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until 
                         their children grow up and leave 
                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-
                         down that they... Do you know how 
                         long it takes a working man to save 
                         five thousand dollars?  Just remember 
                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble 
                         you're talking about... they do most 
                         of the working and paying and living 
                         and dying in this community. Well, 
                         is it too much to have them work and 
                         pay and live and die in a couple of 
                         decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my 
                         father didn't think so. People were 
                         human beings to him, but to you, a 
                         warped, frustrated old man, they're 
                         cattle. Well, in my book he died a 
                         much richer man than you'll ever be!

                                     POTTER
                         I'm not interested in your book. I'm 
                         talking about the Building and Loan.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know very well what you're talking 
                         about. You're talking about something 
                         you can't get your fingers on, and 
                         it's galling you. That's what you're 
                         talking about, I know.
                              (to the Board)
                         Well, I've said too much. I... You're 
                         the Board here. You do what you want 
                         with this thing. Just one thing more, 
                         though. This town needs this measly 
                         one-horse institution if only to 
                         have some place where people can 
                         come without crawling to Potter. 
                         Come on, Uncle Billy!

               George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.  
               Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man" 
               remark was gall in his veins.

                                     POTTER
                         Sentimental hogwash! I want my 
                         motion...

               He is interrupted by a babble of talk, as the directors take 
               up the argument

               INT. OUTER OFFICE  BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers. He 
               is worried about the outcome of the meeting. Dissolving the 
               Building and Loan will alter his plans. Uncle Billy follows 
               him around, chattering.

                         What happened? We heard a lot of

                         Well, we're being voted out of 
                         business after twenty-five years.

                         Yeah, I'll be right down.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Hey, you'll miss your train. You're 
                         a week late for school already. Go 
                         on.

                         Oh, never mind. Don't worry about 
                         that.  They're putting us out of 
                         business. So what? I can get another 
                         job. I'm only fifty-five.

                         want to miss college too, do you?

               Dr. Campbell comes running out, all excited.

                         George! George! They voted Potter

                         But they've got one condition  only 
                         one condition.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         That's the best part of it. They've 
                         appointed George here as executive 
                         secretary to take his father's place.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         You can keep him on. That's all right. 
                         As secretary you can hire anyone you 
                         like.

                                     GEORGE
                              (emphatically)
                         Dr. Campbell, now let's get this 
                         thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm 
                         leaving right now. I'm going to 
                         school. This is my last chance. Uncle 
                         Billy here, he's your man.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         But, George, they'll vote with Potter 
                         otherwise.

               The same stars we saw in the opening sequence are once more 
               twinkling as we hear the voices form Heaven

                         I know. I know. He didn't go.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's right. Not only that, but he 
                         gave his school money to his brother 
                         Harry, and sent him to college. Harry 
                         became a football star  made second 
                         team All American.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Yes, but what happened to George?

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Characteristic activity; a number of people waiting for the 
               train.  Uncle Billy is seated on a baggage wagon eating 
               peanuts as George paces up and down in front of him.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         George got four years older, waiting 
                         for Harry to come back and take over 
                         the Building and Loan.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, there are plenty of jobs around 
                         for somebody that likes to travel. 
                         Look at this.
                              (takes some folders 
                              from his pocket)
                         There... Venezuela oil fields  
                         wanted, man with construction 
                         experience. Here's the Yukon, right 
                         here  wanted, man with engineering 
                         experience.

               The WHISTLE of the approaching train is heard.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thar she blows. You know what the 
                         three most exciting sounds in the 
                         world are?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch 
                         is served; dinner...

                                     GEORGE
                         No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane 
                         motors, and train whistles.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Peanut?

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to 
               get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age 
               as he is.  George rushes into the shot, and as the brothers 
               embrace:

                                     GEORGE
                              (joyously)
                         There's the professor now! Old 
                         professor, Phi Beta Kappa Bailey! 
                         All American!

                                     HARRY
                         Well, if it isn't old George 
                         Geographic Explorer Bailey! What? No 
                         husky dogs? No sled?
                              (to Uncle Billy)
                         Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a 
                         bit.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Nobody ever changes around here. You 
                         know that.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, am I glad to see you.

                                     HARRY
                         Say, where's Mother?

                                     GEORGE
                         She's home cooking the fatted calf. 
                         Come on, let's go.

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute.

               CLOSE SHOT

               The group, including Ruth Dakin. This is the young lady who 
               came off the train with Harry. In the excitement of greetings 
               she has been momentarily forgotten. She stands, smiling, 
               waiting.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         How do you do.

                                     HARRY
                         Ruth Dakin.

                                     RUTH
                         Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

               George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Huh?

                                     HARRY
                         Well, I wired you I had a surprise. 
                         Here she is. Meet the wife.

               George is thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Well, what do you know  wife.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, how do you do. Congratulations.  
                         Congratulations. What am I doing?

               He kisses Ruth.  CAMERA MOVES WITH them down the platform.

                                     GEORGE
                         Harry, why didn't you tell somebody?
                              (to Ruth)
                         What's a pretty girl like you doing 
                         marrying this two-headed brother of 
                         mine?

                                     RUTH
                              (smiling)
                         Well, I'll tell you. It's purely 
                         mercenary. My father offered him a 
                         job.

               George stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth 
               continue out of shot. Harry stops with George.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (as he moves off)
                         Oh, he gets you and a job? Well, 
                         Harry's cup runneth over.

                                     HARRY
                         George... about that job. Ruth spoke 
                         out of turn. I never said I'd take 
                         it. You've been holding the bag here 
                         for four years, and... well, I won't 
                         let you down, George.  I would like 
                         to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot 
                         the bags. I'll be right back.

               He runs out of the shot, George watching him.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking 
               deeply.

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         It was a surprise to me. This is the 
                         new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. 
                         Old, old friend of the family.

                                     RUTH'S VOICE
                         Oh, of course. I've heard him speak 
                         of you.

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         And I want to tell you, we're going 
                         to give the biggest party this town 
                         ever saw.

               CAMERA MOVES WITH George as he comes into the scene. Ruth 
               detaches herself from the group and offers George some 
               popcorn.

                                     RUTH
                              (to George)
                         Here, have some popcorn. George, 
                         George, George... that's all Harry 
                         ever talks about.

                                     GEORGE
                              (quietly)
                         Ruth, this... what about this job?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, well, my father owns a glass 
                         factory in Buffalo. He wants to get 
                         Harry started in the research 
                         business.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is it a good job?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a 
                         good future, you know. Harry's a 
                         genius at research. My father fell 
                         in love with him.

                                     GEORGE
                         And you did, too?

               Ruth nods, smiling.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH  BAILEY HOME  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group 
               assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group 
               breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, 
               leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND UNCLE BILLY

               The latter is tipsy. He feels very high.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so 
                         good I could spit in Potter's eye. I 
                         think I will. What did you say, huh? 
                         Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

               He looks around for his hat, which is on his head.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Where's my hat? Where's my...

               George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to 
               him.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, thank you, George. Which one is 
                         mine?

                                     GEORGE
                              (laughing)
                         The middle one.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old 
                         boy.  Now, look  if you'll point me 
                         in the right direction... would you 
                         do that?  George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Right down here.

               They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle 
               around and heads him down the street.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

                                     GEORGE
                         Now you just turn this way and go 
                         right straight down.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         That way, huh?

               He staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we 
               hear Uncle Billy singing "My Wild Irish Rose." There is a 
               CRASH of cans and bottles, then:

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         I'm all right. I'm all right. "... 
                         the sweetest flower that grows... "

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George is standing at the garden gate. He takes some travel 
               folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. 
               He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. 
               His mother comes out of the house and kisses him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mom.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                              (as she kisses him)
                         That's for nothing. How do you like 
                         her?

               She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a 
               crowd of other couples, are dancing to the MUSIC of a 
               phonograph, and can be seen through the front door.

                                     GEORGE
                         She's swell.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Looks like she can keep Harry on his 
                         toes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Did you know that Mary Hatch is back 
                         from school?

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Came back three days ago.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Nice girl, Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Kind that will help you find the 
                         answers, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Oh, stop that grunting.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Can you give me one good reason why 
                         you shouldn't call on Mary?

                                     GEORGE
                         Sure  Sam Wainwright.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Hmmm?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Well, she's not crazy about him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, how do you know? Did she discuss 
                         it with you?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well then, how do you know?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, 
                         she lights up like a firefly whenever 
                         you're around.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         And besides, Sam Wainwright's away 
                         in New York, and you're here in 
                         Bedford Falls.

                                     GEORGE
                         And all's fair in love and war?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                              (primly)
                         I don't know about war.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother, you know, I can see right 
                         through you  right back to your 
                         back collar button... trying to get 
                         rid of me, huh?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Uh-huh.

               They kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, here's your hat, what's your 
                         hurry?  All right, Mother, old 
                         Building and Loan pal, I think I'll 
                         go out and find a girl and do a little 
                         passionate necking.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Oh, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, if you'll just point me in the 
                         right direction... This direction?
                              (as he leaves)
                         Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George is standing in the middle of the street, hands in his 
               pockets. As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a 
               moment.  He is obviously undecided as to what he wants to 
               do.

               EXT. VIOLET BICK'S BEAUTY SHOP  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Violet is locking up for the night. A couple of men are 
               crowding around her, each one bent on taking her out. There 
               is laughter, kidding and pawing. She looks up and sees George 
               standing there.

                                     VIOLET
                              (to the two men)
                         Excuse me...

                                     MAN
                         Now, wait a minute.

                                     VIOLET
                         I think I got a date. But stick 
                         around, fellows, just in case, huh?

                                     MAN
                         We'll wait for you, baby.

               CAMERA PANS WITH Violet as she crosses the street to George.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Vi.

               He looks her over. Violet takes her beauty shop seriously 
               and she's an eyeful. She senses the fact that George is far 
               from immune to her attractions. She links her arm in his and 
               continues on down the street with him.

               CLOSE MOVING SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET

                                     VIOLET
                         What gives?

                                     GEORGE
                         Nothing.

                                     VIOLET
                         Where are you going?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'll probably end up down at the 
                         library.

               They stop walking and face one another.

                                     VIOLET
                         George, don't you ever get tired of 
                         just reading about things?

               Her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him. 
               He is silent for a moment, then blurts out:

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes... what are you doing tonight?

                                     VIOLET
                              (feigned surprise)
                         Not a thing.

                                     GEORGE
                         Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night 
                         of it.

                                     VIOLET
                              (just what she wanted)
                         Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we 
                         do?

                                     GEORGE
                         Let's go out in the fields and take 
                         off our shoes and walk through the 
                         grass.

                                     VIOLET
                         Huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         Then we can go up to the falls. It's 
                         beautiful up there in the moonlight, 
                         and there's a green pool up there, 
                         and we can swim in it. Then we can 
                         climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the 
                         pines, and watch the sunrise against 
                         the peaks, and... we'll stay up there 
                         the whole night, and everybody'll be 
                         talking and there'll be a terrific 
                         scandal...

                                     VIOLET
                              (interrupting)
                         George, have you gone crazy? Walk in 
                         the grass in my bare feet? Why, it's 
                         ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.

                                     GEORGE
                         Shhh...

                                     VIOLET
                              (angrily)
                         You think just because you...

               By this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above 
               scene.  Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and 
               George is trying to quiet her. Finally:

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, just forget about the whole 
                         thing.

               As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter, and we

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares 
               meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking 
               ahead.  But after a few steps he turns around and starts 
               back. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts 
               back again.

               INT. BEDROOM WINDOW  HATCH HOME  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back 
               and forth.

                                     MARY
                         What are you doing, picketing?

               George stops, startled, and looks up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mary. I just happened to be 
                         passing by.

                                     MARY
                         Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up 
                         your mind?

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

                                     MARY
                         Have you made up your mind?

                                     GEORGE
                         About what?

                                     MARY
                         About coming in. Your mother just 
                         phoned and said you were on your way 
                         over to pay me a visit.

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               George looks surprised at this.

                                     GEORGE
                         My mother just called you? Well, how 
                         did she know?

                                     MARY
                         Didn't you tell her?

                                     GEORGE
                         I didn't tell anybody. I just went 
                         for a walk and happened to be passing 
                         by...

               But Mary has disappeared from the window.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to himself)
                         What do you... went for a walk, that's 
                         all.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               Mary is running down the stairs.

                                     MARY
                              (calling off)
                         I'll be downstairs, mother.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         All right, dear.

               Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes 
               her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs 
               into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel.

               INSERT: THE SKETCH

               It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the 
               moon.  Lettering on the drawing says: "George Lassos The 
               Moon."

               BACK TO SHOT

               Mary runs into the hall, opens the phonograph and puts on a 
               record of "Buffalo Gals."  Then she opens the front door and 
               stands there waiting for George.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George is struggling with the gate  he finally kicks it 
               open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Well, are you coming in or aren't 
                         you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I'll come in for a minute, but 
                         I didn't tell anybody I was coming 
                         over here.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary and George are in the entrance hall.

                                     GEORGE
                         When did you get back?

                                     MARY
                         Tuesday.

                                     GEORGE
                         Where'd you get that dress?

                                     MARY
                         Do you like it?

                                     GEORGE
                         It's all right. I thought you'd go 
                         back to New York like Sam and Ingie, 
                         and the rest of them.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, I worked there for a couple of 
                         vacations, but I don't know... I 
                         guess I was homesick.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shocked)
                         Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, and my family and... oh, 
                         everything.  Would you like to sit 
                         down?

               They go through the doorway into the parlor.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, for a minute. I still 
                         can't understand it though. You know 
                         I didn't tell anybody I was coming 
                         here.

                                     MARY
                         Would you rather leave?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, I don't want to be rude.

                                     MARY
                         Well, then, sit down.

               George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a 
               close look at it.

                                     GEORGE
                              (indicating cartoon)
                         Some joke, huh?

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary sitting on the divan. He is uncomfortable, 
               and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I see it still smells like 
                         pine needles in here.

                                     MARY
                         Thank you.

               There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing 
               with the phonograph record which has been playing all through 
               the above scene:

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         "And dance by the light..."

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah...

               He looks at his watch, as though about to leave.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I...

                                     MARY
                              (desperately)
                         It was nice about your brother Harry, 
                         and Ruth, wasn't it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

                                     MARY
                         Don't you like her?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, of course I like her. She's a 
                         peach.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, it's just marriage in general 
                         you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, marriage is all right for Harry, 
                         and Marty, and Sam and you.

                                     MARY
                         It's George Bailey, Mother.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         George Bailey? What's he want?

                                     MARY
                         I don't know.
                              (to George)
                         What do you want?

                              (indignant)
                         Me? Not a thing. I just came in to 
                         get warm.

                                     MARY
                              (to mother)
                         He's making violent love to me, 
                         Mother.

               George is aghast.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         You tell him to go right back home, 
                         and don't you leave the house, either. 
                         Sam Wainwright promised to call you 
                         from New York tonight.

                              (heatedly)
                         But your mother needn't... you know 
                         I didn't come here to... to... to...

                                     MARY
                              (rising)
                         What did you come here for?

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know. You tell me. You're 
                         supposed to be the one that has all 
                         the answers.  You tell me.

                                     MARY
                              (terribly hurt)
                         Oh, why don't you go home?

                              (almost shouting)
                         That's where I'm going. I don't know 
                         why I came here in the first place! 
                         Good night!

               As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts 
               ringing.

                                     MARY

                         I'll get it.

               As Mary comes into the hall, she stops by the phonograph, 
               which is still playing "Buffalo Gals," takes off the record 
               with a jerk, and smashes it against the machine. The phone 
               is still ringing.

                                     MRS. HATCH

                         Hello.

               As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front 
               porch.

                                     GEORGE
                         I forgot my hat.

                         your voice again.

               George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of

                         You mean old moss-back George?

                         He does so. He asked for him.

                         steal your girl. Here... here's Mary.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I 
                         want to talk to both of you. Tell 
                         Mary to get on the extension.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Mary)
                         Here. You take it. You tell him.

                                     MARY
                         Mother's on the extension.

               INT. UPPER HALLWAY  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT  MRS. HATCH

               As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone 
               on which she has been listening.

               BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         We can both hear. Come here.

               Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of 
               necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very 
               conscious of her proximity.

                                     MARY
                              (on phone)
                         We're listening, Sam.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         I have a big deal coming up that's 
                         going to make us all rich. George, 
                         you remember that night in Martini's 
                         bar when you told me you read 
                         someplace about making plastics out 
                         of soybeans?

                                     GEORGE
                         Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans. 
                         Yeah.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. 
                         He's going to build a factory outside 
                         of Rochester. How do you like that?

               Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious 
               of her, close to him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Well, why not? Can you think of 
                         anything better?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I don't know... why not right 
                         here?  You remember that old tool 
                         and machinery works? You tell your 
                         father he can get that for a song. 
                         And all the labor he wants, too. 
                         Half the town was thrown out of work 
                         when they closed down.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, 
                         that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew 
                         you'd come through. Now, here's the 
                         point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this 
                         too. Now listen.  Have you got any 
                         money?

                                     GEORGE
                         Money? Yeah... well, a little.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Well, now listen. I want you to put 
                         every cent you've got into our stock, 
                         you hear?  And George, I may have a 
                         job for you; that is, unless you're 
                         still married to that broken-down 
                         Building and Loan. This is the biggest 
                         thing since radio, and I'm letting 
                         you in on the ground floor. Oh, 
                         Mary...  Mary...

                                     MARY
                              (nervously)
                         I'm here.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Would you tell that guy I'm giving 
                         him the chance of a lifetime, you 
                         hear? The chance of a lifetime.

               As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost 
               on his lips.

                                     MARY
                              (whispering)
                         He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

               George can stand it no longer. He drops the phone with a 
               crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her. Mary begins 
               to cry.

                                     GEORGE
                              (fiercely)
                         Now you listen to me! I don't want 
                         any plastics! I don't want any ground 
                         floors, and I don't want to get 
                         married  ever  to anyone! You 
                         understand that? I want to do what I 
                         want to do. And you're... and 
                         you're...

               He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each 
               other find themselves in tearful ecstasy.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, Mary... Mary...

                                     MARY
                         George... George... George...

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary...

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs. She practically faints 
               at what she sees.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. FRONT HALL BAILEY HOME  DAY  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

               CLOSEUP

               Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries:

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                         Here they come!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we hear the SOUND of the Wedding March.  
               People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors.  
               There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at 
               the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, 
               red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is 
               caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we 
               see that it is raining.  Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has 
               his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the 
               group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower 
               of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from 
               the curb.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE, MARY AND ERNIE

               George and Mary are in each other's arms.

                                     ERNIE
                         If either of you two see a stranger 
                         around here, it's me.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, look! Somebody's driving this 
                         cab.

               Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne 
               done up in gift wrappings.

                                     ERNIE
                         Bert, the cop, sent this over. He 
                         said to float away to Happy Land on 
                         the bubbles.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, look at this. Champagne!

                                     MARY
                         Good old Bert.

                                     ERNIE
                         By the way, where are you two going 
                         on this here now honeymoon?

                                     GEORGE
                         Where are we going?
                              (takes out a fat roll 
                              of bills)
                         Look at this. There's the kitty, 
                         Ernie.  Here, come on, count it, 
                         Mary.

                                     MARY
                         I feel like a bootlegger's wife.
                              (holding up the money)
                         Look!

                                     GEORGE
                         You know what we're going to do? 
                         We're going to shoot the works. A 
                         whole week in New York. A whole week 
                         in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the 
                         oldest champagne  the richest caviar 
                          the hottest music, and the prettiest 
                         wife!

                                     ERNIE
                         That does it! Then what?

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Mary)
                         Then what, honey?

                                     MARY
                         After that, who cares?

                                     GEORGE
                         That does it  come here.

               The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people 
               around the door. He stops the cab.

               LONG SHOT

               Scurrying people under umbrellas, swarming around the bank 
               doors.  Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close 
               down. Several people come running past the cab.

                         Don't look now, but there's something 
                         funny going on over there at the 
                         bank, George, I've never really seen 
                         one, but that's got all the earmarks 
                         of a run.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in 
                         the bank, you better hurry.

                                     MARY
                         George, let's not stop. Let's go!

               George gets out of the cab and looks down the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh...

                                     MARY
                         Please, let's not stop, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

               George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan.

               EXT. BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT  SIDEWALK

               An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and 
               Loan.  It has been locked. A crowd of men and women are 
               waiting around the grill. They are simply-dressed people, to 
               whom their savings are a matter of life and death.  George 
               comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at 
               him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their 
               rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how 
                         are you? Charlie? What's the matter 
                         here, can't you get in?

               No one answers. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes 
               it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and 
               into the outer offices of the Building and Loan.

               INT. OUTER OFFICE  BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle 
               Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking 
               a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         George...

               He points to George's office. George turns back cheerfully 
               to the crowd.

                                     GEORGE
                         Come on in, everybody. That's right, 
                         just come in.

               George vaults over the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now look, why don't you all sit down.  
                         There are a lot of seats over there. 
                         Just make yourselves at home.

                         George, can I see you a minute?

               The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the 
               teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George 
               hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for 
               him.

                         I just did, but they said you left. 
                         This is a pickle, George, this is a

                         How does anything like this ever 
                         start?  All I know is the bank called 
                         our loan.

                                     GEORGE
                         When?

                         About an hour ago. I had to hand 
                         over all our cash.

                         Every cent of it, and it still was 
                         less than we owe.

                         The whole town's gone crazy.

               The telephone rings. Uncle Billy picks it up.

               Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking

                         that you've closed your doors. Is 
                         that true?  Oh, well, I'm very glad 
                         to hear that...  George, are you all

               More people have crowded around the counter. Their muttering 
               stops and they stand silent and grim. There is panic in their 
               faces.

               As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street 
               below.  The crowd turn to the windows, then back to George.

                         of this place all wrong. As if I had 
                         the money back in a safe. The money's 
                         not here. Your money's in Joe's

                         Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now 
                         listen... now listen to me. I beg of 
                         you not to do this thing. If Potter 
                         gets hold of this Building and Loan 
                         there'll never be another decent 
                         house built in this town. He's already 
                         got charge of the bank.  He's got 
                         the bus line. He's got the department 
                         stores. And now he's after us.  Why? 
                         Well, it's very simple. Because we're 
                         cutting in on his business, that's 
                         why.  And because he wants to keep 
                         you living in his slums and paying 
                         the kind of rent he decides.

               The people are still trying to get out, but some of them 
               have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make 
               an impression on them.

                         you for that broken-down shack?
                              (to Ed)
                         Here, Ed. You know, you remember 
                         last year when things weren't going

                         did you? Do you think Potter would 
                         have let you keep it?

                         Can't you understand what's happening 
                         here? Don't you see what's happening?  
                         Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!  
                         And why? Because we're panicky and 
                         he's not.  That's why. He's picking 
                         up some bargains.  Now, we can get 
                         through this thing all right. We've 
                         got to stick together, though. We've 
                         got to have faith in each other.

                         But my husband hasn't worked in over 
                         a year, and I need money.

                                     WOMAN
                         How am I going to live until the 
                         bank opens?

                                     MAN
                         I got doctor bills to pay.

                                     MAN
                         I need cash.

                                     MAN
                         Can't feed my kids on faith.

               During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. 
               Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the 
               door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out

                                     MARY
                         How much do you need?

               George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey! I got two thousand dollars! 
                         Here's two thousand dollars. This'll 
                         tide us over until the bank reopen.
                              (to Tom)
                         All right, Tom, how much do you need?

                                     TOM
                              (doggedly)
                         Two hundred and forty-two dollars!

                                     GEORGE
                              (pleading)
                         Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you 
                         over till the bank reopens.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take two hundred and forty-two 
                         dollars.

               George starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his 
               passbook on the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         There you are.

                                     TOM
                         That'll close my account.

                                     GEORGE
                         Your account's still here. That's a 
                         loan.

               Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie.  
               George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, 
               and speaks to Ed, the next in line.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay. All right, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I got three hundred dollars here, 
                         George.

               Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash 
               he's got.

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till 
                         the bank reopens? What do you need?

                                     ED
                         Well, I suppose twenty dollars.

                                     GEORGE
                         Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. 
                         Fine.  Thanks, Ed.

                              next in line)
                         All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How 
                         much do you want?

                         But it's your own money, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Never mind about that. How much do 
                         you want?

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         I can get along with twenty, all 
                         right.

                                     GEORGE

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't have to sign anything. I 
                         know you'll pay it back when you 
                         can. That's okay.

               George, Uncle Billy and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, 
               watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George 
               counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the 
               door.

                                     UNCLE BILLY

               Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door, and scurries around 
               the counter to join the others.

                                     GEORGE

               Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle.

                         put them in the safe and see what 
                         happens.

               The four of them parade through the office; George puts the 
               two dollars in the safe.

                         Ernie's still here with his taxicab?

               George rushes into his office to look out the window.

                         I'm hurrying.

               George is approaching the front door of the house, on which 
               a sign is hanging: "Bridal Suite." Ernie looks out through 
               the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door.

                                     ERNIE
                         Hiya... Good evening, sir.

               Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler. 
               This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting 
               on an old coachman's hat. George enters.

                                     ERNIE
                         Entray, monsieur, entray.

               INT. GRANVILLE HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS

               The house is carpetless, empty  the rain and wind cause 
               funny noises upstairs. A huge fire is burning in the 
               fireplace. Near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes 
               are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered 
               with a checkered oil cloth. It is set for two. A bucket with 
               ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a 
               bowl of caviar. Two small chickens are impaled on a spit 
               over the fire. A phonograph is playing on a box, and a string 
               from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit. The 
               phonograph is playing "Song of the Islands." Mary is standing 
               near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked. 
               She is smiling at George, who has been slowly taking in the 
               whole set-up. Through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed, 
               over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie. 
               Ernie exits and closes the door.

                                     MARY
                              (tears in her eyes)
                         Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                              (overcome)
                         Well, I'll be... Mary, Mary, where 
                         did you...

               They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in 
               ecstasy.

                                     MARY
                         Remember the night we broke the 
                         windows in this old house? This is 
                         what I wished for.

                                     GEORGE
                         Darling, you're wonderful.

               They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead.  
               Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               EXT. SLUM STREET BEDFORD FALLS  DAY  TWO YEARS LATER

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street 
               are two vehicles. One of them is George Bailey's rickety 
               car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high 
               with household goods. The Martini family is moving. The family 
               consists of Martini, his wife and four kid of various ages, 
               from two to ten.  George and Mary are helping the Martinis 
               move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Martini and 
               George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are 
               carrying out the last of the furniture.  As they emerge from 
               the house, one of the neighbors, Schultz, calls out:

                                     SCHULTZ
                         Martini, you rented a new house?

                                     MARTINI
                         Rent?
                              (to George)
                         You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     MARTINI
                         I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. 
                         I own my own house. No more we live 
                         like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. 
                         Hurry, Maria.

                                     MARIA
                         Yes...

                                     GEORGE
                         Come on...
                              (to Mary)
                         Bring the baby.
                              (to Martini)
                         I'll bring the kids in the car.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

               Mary gets in the front seat of the car, with the baby in her 
               arms.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, kids  here  get in here. 
                         Now get right up on the seat there.  
                         Get the...  get the goat!

               The family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids.

                                     MARTINI
                         Goodbye, everybody!

                                     GEORGE
                         All in...

               The rickety caravan starts off down the street, to the cheers 
               of the neighbors.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               Sign hanging from a tree "Welcome to Bailey Park." CAMERA 
               PANS TO follow George's car and the old truck laden with 
               furniture as they pass  we hear Martini's voice singing "O 
               Sole Mio." Bailey Park is a district of new small houses, 
               not all alike, but each individual. New lawns here and there, 
               and young trees. It has the promise when built up of being a 
               pleasant little middle class section.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               pointing to maps spread out on the desk.

                                     REINEMAN

                         my nose. I'm just your little rent 
                         collector.  But you can't laugh off 
                         this Bailey Park any more. Look at 
                         it.

               A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his 
               desk.

                         There's the old cemetery, squirrels, 
                         buttercups, daisies. Used to hunt 
                         rabbits there myself. Look at it 
                         today. Dozens of the prettiest little 
                         homes you ever saw.  Ninety per cent 
                         owned by suckers who used to pay 
                         rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my 
                         dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just 
                         that. And are the local yokels making 
                         with those David and Goliath 
                         wisecracks!

                         they know the Baileys haven't made a 
                         dime out of it.

                                     REINEMAN
                         You know very well why. The Baileys 
                         were all chumps. Every one of these 
                         homes is worth twice what it cost 
                         the Building and Loan to build. If I 
                         were you, Mr. Potter...

                         Well, you are not me.

                                     REINEMAN
                              (as he leaves)
                         As I say, it's no skin off my nose. 
                         But one of these days this bright 
                         young man is going to be asking George 
                         Bailey for a job.

               Reineman exits.

                                     POTTER
                         The Bailey family has been a boil on 
                         my neck long enough.

               He flips the switch on the dictaphone.

                         drive down with us, huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, 
                         Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Still got the nose to the old 
                         grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to 
                         let George in on the ground floor in 
                         plastics, and he turned me down cold.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, now, don't rub it in.

                                     SAM
                         I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess 
                         we better run along.

               There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into 
               their car.

                                     JANE
                         Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Nice meeting you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Goodbye.

                                     JANE
                         Goodbye, George.

                                     SAM
                         So long, George. See you in the funny 
                         papers.

                                     GEORGE
                         Goodbye, Sam.

                                     MARY
                         Have fun.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thanks for dropping around.

                                     SAM
                              (to chauffeur)
                         To Florida!
                              (to George)
                         Hee-haw!

                                     GEORGE
                         Hee-haw.

               The big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing 
               with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They 
               slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. POTTER'S OFFICE  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT

               Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George. 
               The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. 
                         Potter.

                                     POTTER
                         You like it? I'll send you a box.

                                     GEORGE
                              (nervously)
                         Well, I... I suppose I'll find out 
                         sooner or later, but just what exactly 
                         did you want to see me about?

                                     POTTER
                              (laughs)
                         George, now that's just what I like 
                         so much about you.
                              (pleasantly and 
                              smoothly)
                         George, I'm an old man, and most 
                         people hate me. But I don't like 
                         them either, so that makes it all 
                         even. You know just as well as I do 
                         that I run practically everything in 
                         this town but the Bailey Building 
                         and Loan. You know, also, that for a 
                         number of years I've been trying to 
                         get control of it... or kill it. But 
                         I haven't been able to do it. You 
                         have been stopping me. In fact, you 
                         have beaten me, George, and as anyone 
                         in this county can tell you, that 
                         takes some doing. Take during the 
                         depression, for instance. You and I 
                         were the only ones that kept our 
                         heads. You saved the Building and 
                         Loan, and I saved all the rest.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes. Well, most people say you stole 
                         all the rest.

                                     POTTER
                         The envious ones say that, George, 
                         the suckers. Now, I have stated my 
                         side very frankly. Now, let's look 
                         at your side.  Young man, twenty-
                         seven, twenty-eight...  married, 
                         making, say... forty a week.

                                     GEORGE
                              (indignantly)
                         Forty-five!

                                     POTTER
                         Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, 
                         after supporting your mother, and 
                         paying your bills, you're able to 
                         keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child 
                         or two comes along, and you won't 
                         even be able to save the ten. Now, 
                         if this young man of twenty-eight 
                         was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd 
                         say he was doing fine. But George 
                         Bailey is not a common, ordinary 
                         yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, 
                         ambitious young man  who hates his 
                         job  who hates the Building and 
                         Loan almost as much as I do. A young 
                         man who's been dying to get out on 
                         his own ever since he was born. A 
                         young man... the smartest one of the 
                         crowd, mind you, a young man who has 
                         to sit by and watch his friends go 
                         places, because he's trapped.  Yes, 
                         sir, trapped into frittering his 
                         life away playing nursemaid to a lot 
                         of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a 
                         correct picture, or do I exaggerate?

                                     GEORGE
                              (mystified)
                         Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?

                                     POTTER
                         My point? My point is, I want to 
                         hire you.

                                     GEORGE
                              (dumbfounded)
                         Hire me?

                                     POTTER
                         I want you to manage my affairs, run 
                         my properties. George, I'll start 
                         you out at twenty thousand dollars a 
                         year.

               George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off 
               the sparks from his clothes.

                                     GEORGE
                              (flabbergasted)
                         Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars 
                         a year?

                                     POTTER
                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest 
                         house in town, buying your wife a 
                         lot of fine clothes, a couple of 
                         business trips to New York a year, 
                         maybe once in a while Europe. You 
                         wouldn't mind that, would you, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Would I?
                              (looking around 
                              skeptically)
                         You're not talking to somebody else 
                         around here, are you? You know, this 
                         is me, you remember me? George Bailey.

                                     POTTER
                         Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship 
                         has just come in  providing he has 
                         brains enough to climb aboard.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, what about the Building and 
                         Loan?

                                     POTTER
                         Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid 
                         of success? I'm offering you a three 
                         year contract at twenty thousand 
                         dollars a year, starting today. Is 
                         it a deal or isn't it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I 
                         ought to jump at the chance, but 
                         I... I just...  I wonder if it would 
                         be possible for you to give me twenty-
                         four hours to think it over?

                                     POTTER
                         Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and 
                         talk about it to your wife.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'd like to do that.

                                     POTTER
                         In the meantime, I'll draw up the 
                         papers.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, sir.

                                     POTTER
                              (offers hand)
                         Okay, George?

                                     GEORGE
                              (taking his hand)
                         Okay, Mr. Potter.

               As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. 
               Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that 
               moment of physical contact he knows he could never be 
               associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a 
               shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.

                                     GEORGE
                              (vehemently)
                         No... no... no... no, now wait a 
                         minute, here!  I don't have to talk 
                         to anybody!  I know right now, and 
                         the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it!
                              (getting madder all 
                              the time)
                         You sit around here and you spin 
                         your little webs and you think the 
                         whole world revolves around you and 
                         your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. 
                         Potter!  In the... in the whole vast 
                         configuration of things, I'd say you 
                         were nothing but a scurvy little 
                         spider. You...

               He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside 
               Potter's wheelchair.

                                     GEORGE
                         ...And that goes for you too!

               As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr. 
               Potter's secretary in the outer office

                                     GEORGE
                         And it goes for you too!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. BEDROOM  GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS THE BEDROOM

               The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair 
               or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George 
               comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, 
               relating to incidents in his past life.

                                     POTTER'S VOICE
                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest 
                         house in town. Buying your wife a

                         York on a business trip a couple of 
                         times a year.  Maybe to Europe once 
                         in a while.

               George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser 
               and stares at his reflection in the mirror.

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         I know what I'm going to do tomorrow 
                         and the next day and next year and 
                         the year after that. I'm shaking the 
                         dust of this crummy little town off 
                         my feet, and I'm going to see the 
                         world... And I'm going to build 
                         things. I'm going to build air fields.  
                         I'm going to build skyscrapers a 
                         hundred stories high. I'm going to 
                         build a bridge a mile long.

               While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, 
               his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the 
               dresser:

               INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL

               It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first 
               saw in Mary's living room. The lettering reads: "George Lassos 
               The Moon."

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         What is it you want, Mary? You want 
                         the moon? If you do, just say the 
                         word; I'll throw a lasso around it 
                         and pull it down for you.

               Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals, won't you come out 
                         tonight, won't you come out tonight, 
                         won't you come out tonight.

               George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hi.

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary Hatch, why in the world did you 
                         ever marry a guy like me?

                                     MARY
                         To keep from being an old maid.

                                     GEORGE
                         You could have married Sam Wainwright 
                         or anybody else in town.

                                     MARY
                         I didn't want to marry anybody else 
                         in town. I want my baby to look like 
                         you.

                                     GEORGE
                         You didn't even have a honeymoon. I 
                         promised you...
                              (does a double take)
                         ...Your what?

                                     MARY
                         My baby.

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulously)
                         You mean... Mary, you on the nest?

                                     MARY
                         George Bailey lassos stork.

                         Lassos the stork! You mean you... 
                         What is it, a boy or a girl?

               Mary nods her head happily.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in 
               the breeze.  Draped around one arm is a large Christmas 
               wreath. Under his other arm are several more copies of the 
               paper.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE

                         about ten A.M. Bedford Falls time...

               George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on 
               the sidewalk.

               INSERT: NEWSPAPER

               The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel. The 
               headline reads: "PRESIDENT DECORATES HARRY BAILEY  LOCAL 
               BOY WINS CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR". The subhead tells of 
               a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a 
               banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N. on his 
               way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional 
               Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman 
               pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of 
               dignitaries; a picture of the transport which Harry saved. 
               Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story.

                              (outraged)
                         What do you mean  it's gonna snow 
                         again?  Look at the headlines.

                         I know  I know  I know. I think 
                         it's marvelous.

               Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and 
               joins them.

                                     GEORGE
                              (reading)
                         Commander Harry Bailey. Mr. Gower, 
                         look at this  the second page.
                              (gives them papers)
                         Now look, this is for you. This is 
                         for you, this is for you.
                              (as he leaves)
                         See you again.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to 
               himself. He sees some men decorating the Court House with 
               banners and bunting  there is a huge sign reading: "Welcome 
               Home Harry Bailey"

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (calls out)

               INT. OUTER OFFICE BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY

               FULL SHOT

               The offices are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned. 
               The same office force, albeit a few years older: Cousin Tilly 
               and Cousin Eustace. Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man 
               with a brief case. The outer door opens and George enters:

                                     GEORGE
                         Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

               Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone.

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                         George! George! It's Harry now on 
                         long distance from Washington!

                                     GEORGE
                         Harry! What do you know about that?

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                         He reversed the charges. It's okay, 
                         isn't it?

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean it's okay?  For a 
                         hero?
                              (takes the phone)
                         Harry!  Oh, you old seven kinds of a 
                         son of a gun. Congratulations!  How's 
                         Mother standing it?... She did? What 
                         do you know...
                              (to Eustace)
                         Mother had lunch with the President's 
                         wife!

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                         Wait till Martha hears about this.

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                         What did they have to eat?

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         What did they have to eat? Harry, 
                         you should see what they're cooking 
                         up in the town for you... Oh, are 
                         they?
                              (to Eustace)
                         The Navy's going to fly Mother home 
                         this afternoon.

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                         In a plane?

                                     GEORGE
                         What? Uncle Billy?
                              (to Eustace)
                         Has Uncle Billy come in yet?

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                         No, he stopped at the bank first.

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         He's not here right now, Harry.

               Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a 
               glimpse of the man waiting in the chair. This is Carter, the 
               bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the 
               Building and Loan.

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         But look...

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                              (interrupting)
                         George...

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         ...now tell me about it.

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                              (interrupting)
                         ...George, that man's here again.

                                     GEORGE
                         What man?

                                     COUSIN EUSTACE
                              (nervously)
                         Bank... bank examiner.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...
                              (on phone)
                         Talk to Eustace a minute, will you. 
                         I'll be right back.

               He gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath and goes 
               over to Carter.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CARTER

               They shake hands.

                                     GEORGE
                         Good morning, sir.

                         Merry Christmas.

                                     GEORGE
                         We're all excited around here.
                              (shows him paper)
                         My brother just got the Congressional 
                         Medal of Honor. The President just 
                         decorated him.

                                     CARTER
                         Well, I guess they do those things. 
                         Well, I trust you had a good year.

                                     GEORGE
                         Good year? Well, between you and me, 
                         Mr. Carter, we're broke.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, very funny.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well...
                              (leading him into 
                              office)
                         ...now, come right in here, Mr. 
                         Carter.

                                     CARTER
                              (as they go)
                         Although I shouldn't wonder when you 
                         okay reverse charges on personal 
                         long distance calls.

                         George, shall we hang up?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle 
                         Billy.  You just hold on.

                                     CARTER
                              (in doorway)
                         Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd like 
                         to finish with you by tonight. I 
                         want to spend Christmas in Elmira 
                         with my family.

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter, 
                         Just step right in here. We'll fix 
                         you up.

               INT. BANK  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT

               Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (writing)
                         December twenty-fourth...

               He takes a thick envelope from his inside pocket and thumbs 
               through the bills it contains. It is evidently a large sum 
               of money.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Eight thousand...

               MEDIUM SHOT  DOOR TO STREET

               Potter is being wheeled in by his goon. Various bank officials 
               run over to greet him  he is reading a newspaper. Uncle 
               Billy has finished filling out his slip, and comes over to 
               taunt Potter, the envelope containing the money in his hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's 
                         the news?

               He grabs the paper from Potter's hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY(CONT'D)
                         Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins 
                         Congressional Medal. That couldn't 
                         be one of the Bailey boys? You just 
                         can't keep those Baileys down, now, 
                         can you, Mr. Potter?

                                     POTTER
                         How does slacker George feel about 
                         that?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Very jealous, very jealous. He only 
                         lost three buttons off his vest. Of 
                         course, slacker George would have 
                         gotten two of those medals if he had 
                         gone.

                                     POTTER
                         Bad ear.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Yes.

               Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing 
               his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         After all, Potter, some people like 
                         George had to stay home. Not every 
                         heel was in Germany and Japan!

               In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward 
               his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward 
               deposit window with his deposit slip.

                                     CLOSE SHOT
                         Uncle Billy and bank teller at the 
                         window.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (still chuckling)
                         Good morning, Horace.

               Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, 
               starts to punch it with rubber stamps.

                                     TELLER
                         I guess you forgot something.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Huh?

                                     TELLER
                         You forgot something.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         What?

                                     TELLER
                         Well, aren't you going to make a 
                         deposit?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Sure, sure I am.

                                     TELLER
                         Well, then... it's usually customary 
                         to bring the money with you.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, shucks...

               Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (looks bewildered)
                         I know I had...

               The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of

               Potter is now behind his desk. He spreads the newspaper out 
               in front of him, muttering as he does so.

                                     POTTER
                         Bailey...

               He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money. Then, to 
               his goon, indicating the office door:

                                     POTTER
                         Take me back there. Hurry up.

                         Come on, look sharp.

               Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into 
               the bank.

               Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope. It is not 
               there.  He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern 
               creeps into his eyes. He starts thumping his pockets, with 
               increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the 
               floor. He finally rushes through the door and out into the 
               street.

                         Take me back.

               The goon wheels him back to his desk. He is deep in thought, 
               with a crafty expression on his face.

               He sees Violet Bick standing there.

                         Why, of course you can. Come on in 
                         the office here.

               He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office.

                         Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on

               George and Violet enter his private office. Uncle Billy comes 
               hurrying in.

                         Here he is.

               Uncle Billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly, 
               without knowing what he is saying.

                                     UNCLE BILLY

                         everything... everything's fine.

               He hangs up agitatedly, muttering to himself as he goes into 
               his own office. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace look after 
               him, dumbfounded.

                                     GEORGE
                              (hands it to her)

                                     GEORGE
                         It takes a lot of character to leave 
                         your home town and start all over 
                         again.  He pulls some money from his 
                         pocket, and offers it to her.

               She looks at him, then says a strange thing.

                         I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

               She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick.  
               George opens the door for her.

               Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it 
               with her handkerchief.

                                     GEORGE

               out and are on the floor. Every conceivable place which might 
               have been used by Uncle Billy to put the money has been 
               searched. George, his hair rumpled, is feverishly pursuing

               Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. George grabs him by

                         Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! 
                         Think!

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (sobbing)
                         I can't think any more, George. I 
                         can't think any more. It hurts...

               George jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy 
               stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets 
               hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost 
               maniacal.

                                     GEORGE
                              (screaming at him)
                         Where's that money, you stupid, silly 
                         old fool? Where's the money?  Do you 
                         realize what this means? It means 
                         bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!

               He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts 
               at him:

                                     GEORGE
                         That's what it means! One of us is 
                         going to jail! Well, it's not going 
                         to be me!

               George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a 
               waste basket on the floor as he goes. Uncle Billy remains 
               sobbing at the table, his head in his arms.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Janie (aged eight) is seated at the piano playing "Hark, the 
               Herald Angels Sing," which she practices during the remainder 
               of this scene. There is a Christmas tree all decorated near 
               the fireplace. At a large table Mary is busy putting 
               cellophane bows and decorations on gift packages. At a small 
               table Pete (aged nine) is seated with pad and pencil in the 
               throes of composition.  On the floor Tommy (aged three) is 
               playing with a toy vacuum cleaner. We hear the SOUND of a 
               door open and close. Mary turns and sees George enter the 
               hall, a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders.

               As George comes into the house.

                                     MARY
                         Hello darling.

                                     CHILDREN
                         Hello Daddy, hello daddy.

                                     MARY
                              (indicating tree)
                         How do you like it?

               George sneezes violently.

                                     MARY AND CHILDREN
                         Bless you!

                                     MARY
                         Did you bring the wreath?

                                     PETE
                         Did you bring the Christmas wreath?

                                     GEORGE
                         What? What wreath?

                                     MARY
                         The Merry Christmas wreath for the 
                         window.

                                     GEORGE
                              (gruffly)
                         No. I left it at the office.

                                     MARY
                         Is it snowing?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, just started.

                                     MARY
                         Where's your coat and hat?

                                     GEORGE
                         Left them at the office.

               Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened.

                                     MARY
                         What's the matter?

                                     GEORGE
                              (bitterly)
                         Nothing's the matter. Everything's 
                         all right.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap. 
               Mary is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree.

                                     MARY
                         Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.  You 
                         can put the star up. Way up at the 
                         top. That's it.  Fill in that little 
                         bare spot right there.  That's it.
                              (to George)
                         Isn't it wonderful about Harry?  
                         We're famous, George. I'll bet I had 
                         fifty calls today about the parade, 
                         the banquet. Your mother's so excited, 
                         she...

               During this scene, George has been sitting in the chair, 
               hugging Tommy to him, and crying quietly. Mary realizes that 
               something is seriously wrong, and breaks off. Janie is 
               thumping away at the piano.

                                     GEORGE
                         Must she keep playing that?

                                     JANIE
                              (hurt)
                         I have to practice for the party 
                         tonight, Daddy.

                                     PETE
                         Mommy says we can stay up till 
                         midnight and sing Christmas carols.

                                     TOMMY
                         Can you sing, Daddy?

                                     MARY
                              (to George)
                         Better hurry and shave. The families 
                         will be here soon.

                                     GEORGE
                              (rising from chair)
                         Families!  I don't want the families 
                         over here!

               Mary leads him out toward the kitchen.

                                     MARY
                         Come on out in the kitchen with me 
                         while I finish dinner.

               They exit with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails, and 
               pulling at him. CAMERA PANS WITH them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Excuse me... excuse me...

                         Have a hectic day?

                                     GEORGE
                              (bitterly)
                         Oh, yeah, another big red letter day 
                         for the Baileys.

                                     PETE
                         Daddy, the Browns next door have a 
                         new car. You should see it.

                                     GEORGE
                              (turns on him)
                         Well, what's the matter with our 
                         car?  Isn't it good enough for you?

                                     PETE
                         Yes, Daddy.

               They come through the door.

                              (annoyed)
                         Excuse you for what?

                                     TOMMY
                         I burped!

                                     MARY
                         All right, darling, you're excused. 
                         Now go upstairs and see what little 
                         Zuzu wants.

               Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove.

                                     GEORGE
                         Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?

                                     MARY
                         Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. 
                         Caught it coming home from school.  
                         They gave her a flower for a prize 
                         and she didn't want to crush it so 
                         she didn't button up her coat.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is it, a sore throat or what?

                                     MARY
                         Just a cold. The doctor says it's 
                         nothing serious.

                                     GEORGE
                         The doctor? Was the doctor here?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, I called him right away. He 
                         says it's nothing to worry about.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is she running a temperature? What 
                         is it?

                                     MARY
                         Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, 
                         six.  She'll be all right.

               George paces about the kitchen, worried.

                                     GEORGE
                         Gosh, it's this old house. I don't 
                         know why we don't all have pneumonia. 
                         This drafty old barn! Might as well 
                         be living in a refrigerator. Why did 
                         we have to live here in the first 
                         place and stay around this measly, 
                         crummy old town?

                                     MARY
                              (worried)
                         George, what's wrong?

                                     GEORGE
                         Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call 
                         this a happy family? Why did we have 
                         to have all these kids?

                                     PETE
                              (coming in)
                         Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouts)
                         I don't know. Ask your mother.

               George goes toward doorway.

                                     MARY
                         Where're you going?

                         Going up to see Zuzu.

               We hear his footsteps as he leaves. Mary looks after him, 
               puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete.

                                     PETE
                         He told me to write a play for 
                         tonight.

               The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a 
               moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. 
               Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs.

               INT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same 
               monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting 
               up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding 
               her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's 
               awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.

                                     ZUZU
                         Hi, Daddy.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, what happened to you?

                                     ZUZU
                         I won a flower.

               She starts to get out of bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Wait now. Where do you think you're 
                         going?

                                     ZUZU
                         Want to give my flower a drink.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, all right. Here, give 
                         Daddy the flower. I'll give it a 
                         drink.

               She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few 
               petals fall off. She picks them up.

                                     ZUZU
                         Look, Daddy... paste it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste 
                         this together.

               She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his 
               back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He 
               sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the 
               flower, and then turns back to Zuzu.

                                     GEORGE
                         There it is, good as new.

                                     ZUZU
                         Give the flower a drink.

               George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside 
               her bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, will you do something for me?

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ZUZU

               They whisper.

                                     ZUZU
                         What?

                                     GEORGE
                         Will you try to get some sleep?

                                     ZUZU
                         I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my 
                         flower.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know  I know, but you just go to 
                         sleep, and then you can dream about 
                         it, and it'll be a whole garden.

                                     ZUZU
                         It will?

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-huh.

               She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the 
               covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril 
               of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the 
               room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano. 
               Pete is seated at the table writing. Tommy is playing with 
               his toy vacuum cleaner. The telephone rings.

                                     JANIE AND PETE
                         Telephone.

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary comes in and picks up the phone.

                                     MARY
                         I'll get it.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

               George enters shot, and stands listening to her.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure 
                         she'll be all right. The doctor says 
                         that she ought to be out of bed in 
                         time to have her Christmas dinner.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is that Zuzu's teacher?

                                     MARY
                              (hand over receiver)
                         Yes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Let me speak to her.

               He snatches the phone from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?  This is 
                         George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. 
                         Say, what kind of a teacher are you 
                         anyway?  What do you mean sending 
                         her home like that, halfnaked?  Do 
                         you realize she'll probably end up 
                         with pneumonia on account of you?

                                     MARY
                              (shocked)
                         George!

               She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. 
               She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is 
               really a tirade against the world, against life itself, 
               against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice 
               sputtering with protest.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is this the sort of thing we pay 
                         taxes for  to have teachers like 
                         you? Silly, stupid, careless people 
                         who send our kids home without any 
                         clothes on? You know, maybe my kids 
                         aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe 
                         they don't have any decent clothes...

               Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, that stupid...

               Mary speaks quickly in to the phone.

                                     MARY
                         Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to 
                         apologize...  hello... hello...
                              (to George)
                         She's hung up.

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         I'll hang her up!

               But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male 
               voice calling:

                                     MR. WELCH'S VOICE
                         Now, who do you think you are?

               George hears this and grabs the receiver from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Mary)
                         Wait a minute.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch?  
                         Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives 
                         me a chance to tell you what I really 
                         think of your wife.

               Mary once more tries to take the phone from him.

                                     MARY
                         George...

                                     GEORGE
                              (raving at her)
                         Will you get out and let me handle 
                         this?
                              (into phone  shouting)
                         Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, 
                         huh?  Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you 
                         think you're man enough... Hello? 
                         Any...

               But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear 
               a click on the phone.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

               He hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room. 
               His face is flushed and wet.

                                     PETE
                         Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouts)
                         How should I know? What do you think 
                         I am, a dictionary?

               He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner.

                                     GEORGE
                         Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

               Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously.

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         Janie, haven't you learned that silly 
                         tune yet? You've played it over and 
                         over again.  Now stop it! Stop it!

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND 
               being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner 
               of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, 
               several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely 
               he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them 
               into the corner.  Mary and the children watch, horrified. 
               George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he 
               were some unknown wild animal.  The three children are crying.

                                     GEORGE
                              (gasping for breath)
                         I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I 
                         didn't mean... you go on and practice.  
                         Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm 
                         sorry. What do you want to know?

                                     PETE
                              (holding back his 
                              tears)
                         Nothing, Daddy.

               Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious 
               outburst. There is silence in the room.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter with everybody? 
                         Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
                              (shouts)
                         Now, go on, play!

               Janie breaks into sobs.

                                     JANIE
                         Oh, Daddy...

                                     MARY
                              (in an outburst)
                         George, why must you torture the 
                         children?  Why don't you...

               The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for 
               George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary...

               He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of 
               the house. Mary goes to the phone, picks it up.

                                     MARY
                         Bedford, two-four-seven, please.

                                     PETE
                         Is Daddy in trouble?

                                     JANIE
                         Shall I pray for him?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

                                     TOMMY
                         Me, too?

                                     MARY
                         You too, Tommy.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello, Uncle Billy?

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. POTTER'S OFFICE IN BANK  NIGHT  8:00 P.M.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is 
               signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the 
               desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need 
                         help.  Through some sort of an 
                         accident my company's short in their 
                         accounts. The bank examiner's up 
                         there today. I've got to raise eight 
                         thousand dollars immediately.

                                     POTTER
                              (casually)
                         Oh, so that's what the reporters 
                         wanted to talk to you about?

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulous)
                         The reporters?

                                     POTTER
                         Yes. They called me up from your 
                         Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man 
                         over there from the D.A.'s office, 
                         too. He's looking for you.

                                     GEORGE
                              (desperate)
                         Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, 
                         won't you please? Can't you see what 
                         it means to my family? I'll pay you 
                         any sort of a bonus on the loan... 
                         any interest. If you still want the 
                         Building and Loan, why I...

                              (interrupting)
                         George, could it possibly be there's 
                         a slight discrepancy in the books?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. There's nothing wrong with 
                         the books. I've just misplaced eight 
                         thousand dollars. I can't find it 
                         anywhere.

                                     POTTER
                              (looking up)
                         You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         Have you notified the police?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.  
                         Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

                                     POTTER
                              (snorts)
                         They're going to believe that one. 
                         What've you been doing, George? 
                         Playing the market with the company's 
                         money?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.

                                     POTTER
                         What is it  a woman, then? You know, 
                         it's all over town that you've been 
                         giving money to Violet Bick.

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulous)
                         What?

                                     POTTER
                         Not that it makes any difference to 
                         me, but why did you come to me? Why 
                         don't you go to Sam Wainwright and 
                         ask him for the money?

                                     GEORGE
                         I can't get hold of him. He's in 
                         Europe.

                                     POTTER
                         Well, what about all your other 
                         friends?

                                     GEORGE
                         They don't have that kind of money, 
                         Mr. Potter. You know that. You're 
                         the only one in town that can help 
                         me.

                                     POTTER
                         I see. I've suddenly become quite 
                         important. What kind of security 
                         would I have, George? Have you got 
                         any stocks?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shaking his head)
                         No, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of 
                         any kind?

                                     GEORGE
                              (pulls out policy)
                         I have some life insurance, a fifteen 
                         thousand dollar policy.

                                     POTTER
                         Yes... how much is your equity in 
                         it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Five hundred dollars.

                                     POTTER
                              (sarcastically)
                         Look at you. You used to be so cocky! 
                         You were going to go out and conquer 
                         the world! You once called me a 
                         warped, frustrated old man. What are 
                         you but a warped, frustrated young 
                         man? A miserable little clerk crawling 
                         in here on your hands and knees and 
                         begging for help. No securities  no 
                         stocks  no bonds  nothing but a 
                         miserable little five hundred dollar 
                         equity in a life insurance policy. 
                         You're worth more dead than alive.  
                         Why don't you go to the riff-raff 
                         you love so much and ask them to let 
                         you have eight thousand dollar? You 
                         know why? Because they'd run you out 
                         of town on a rail... But I'll tell 
                         you what I'm going to do for you, 
                         George. Since the state examiner is 
                         still here, as a stockholder of the 
                         Building and Loan, I'm going to swear 
                         out a warrant for your arrest.  
                         Misappropriation of funds  
                         manipulation  malfeasance...

               George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up 
               the phone and dials.

                                     POTTER
                         All right, George, go ahead. You 
                         can't hide in a little town like 
                         this.

               George is out of the door by now.  CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to 
               Potter.

                                     POTTER
                              (on phone)
                         Bill? This is Potter.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses 
               the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps 
               over the door, and drives off.

               EXT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name 
               "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall.

               INT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles 
               sparkle.  There are Christmas greens and holly decorating 
               the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini 
               himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the 
               checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of 
               festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a 
               public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has 
               had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                              (greeting new customers)
                         Merry Christmas. Glad you came.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         How about some of that good spaghetti?

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                         We got everything.

               During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the 
               bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other 
               side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of 
               beer. George is mumbling:

                                     GEORGE
                         God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, 
                         I'm not a praying man, but if you're 
                         up there and you can hear me, show 
                         me the way. I'm at the end of my 
                         rope. Show me the way, God.

                                     NICK
                              (friendly)
                         Are you all right, George? Want 
                         someone to take you home?

               George shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side.

                                     MARTINI
                              (worried)
                         Why you drink so much, my friend? 
                         Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is 
                         Christmas Eve.

               The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts 
               sharply to the name "Bailey."

                                     MAN
                         Bailey? Which Bailey?

                                     NICK
                         This is Mr. George Bailey.

               Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at 
               George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several 
               others rush to pick him up.

                                     MAN
                              (to George)
                         And the next time you talk to my 
                         wife like that you'll get worse. She 
                         cried for an hour. It isn't enough 
                         she slaves teaching your stupid kids 
                         how to read and write, and you have 
                         to bawl her out...

                                     MARTINI
                              (furious)
                         You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

               Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money.

                                     WELCH
                         Now wait... I want to pay for my 
                         drink.

                                     MARTINI
                         Never mind the money. You get out of 
                         here quick.

                                     WELCH
                         All right.

                                     MARTINI
                         You hit my best friend. Get out!

               Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to 
               help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding.

                                     NICK
                         You all right, George?

                                     GEORGE
                              (stunned)
                         Who was that?

                                     MARTINI
                         He's gone. Don't worry. His name is 
                         Welch.  He don't come in to my place 
                         no more.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh  Welch. That's what I get for 
                         praying.

                                     MARTINI
                         The last time he come in here. You 
                         hear that, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         Yes, you bet.

                                     GEORGE
                         Where's my insurance policy?
                              (finds it in pocket)
                         Oh, here...

               He starts for the door.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, no, Please, don't go out this 
                         way, Mr. Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm all right.

               Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, no  you don't feel so good.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm all right.

                                     MARTINI
                         Please don't go away  please!

               George opens the door and exits to the street.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling 
               snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the 
               sidewalk of a house.  George gets out to look at the damage, 
               and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to 
               shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running 
               out.

                                     OWNER
                         What do you think you're doing?

               CLOSE SHOT

               George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. 
               The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George 
               stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, 
               looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages.

                              (with indignation)
                         Now look what you did. My 
                         greatgrandfather planted this tree.

               George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to 
               the man.

                                     OWNER
                         Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here, 
                         you drunken fool! Get this car out 
                         of here!

               EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck 
               swings around the corner and nearly hits him.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's the matter with you?  
                         Look where you're going!

               The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow 
               catwalk at the railing.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. 
               The snow is now falling hard.

               EXT. RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN from George's angle TO the water, dotted 
               with floating ice, passing under the bridge.

               EXT. BRIDGE AT RAILING  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE

               He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up 
               his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, 
               fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as 
               though about to jump.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water 
               with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified.

                                     VOICE
                              (from river)
                         Help! Help!

               George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing 
               into the water.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, 
               and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man.

                                     MAN
                         Help! Help! Help!

               EXT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes 
               running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines 
               on the two figures struggling in the water below.

               EXT. RIVER  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we 
               have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs 
               hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER

               George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which 
               his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter 
               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at 
               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the 
               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved 
               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the 
               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous 
               seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night 
               shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at 
               the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The 
               tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them 
               suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but 
               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or 
               says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing 
               the tollkeeper.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I didn't have time to get some stylish 
                         underwear. My wife gave me this on 
                         my last birthday. I passed away in 
                         it.

               The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of 
               it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's 
               attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is 
               hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. 
                         You should read the new book Mark 
                         Twain's writing now.

               The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         How'd you happen to fall in?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I didn't fall in. I jumped in to 
                         save George.

               George looks up, surprised.

                                     GEORGE
                         You what? To save me?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go 
                         through with it, did you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Go through with what?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Suicide.

               George and the tollkeeper react to this.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         It's against the law to commit suicide 
                         around here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Yeah, it's against the law where I 
                         come from, too.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         Where do you come from?

               He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next 
               statement.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Heaven.
                              (to George)
                         I had to act quickly; that's why I 
                         jumped in. I knew if I were drowning 
                         you'd try to save me. And you see, 
                         you did, and that's how I saved you.

               The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually 
               looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.

                                     GEORGE
                              (offhand)
                         Very funny.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your lip's bleeding, George.

               George's hand goes to his mouth.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in 
                         answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (comes around to George)
                         Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to 
                         your prayer. That's why I was sent 
                         down here.

                                     GEORGE
                              (casually interested)
                         How do you know my name?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, I know all about you. I've watched 
                         you grow up from a little boy.

                                     GEORGE
                         What are you, a mind reader or 
                         something?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, no.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, who are you, then?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

                                     GEORGE
                         Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Angel, Second Class.

               The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. 
               He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on 
               two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the 
               door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest 
               cop.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to tollkeeper)
                         Cheerio, my good man.

               George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini 
                         put in those drinks?

               He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, what's with you? What did you 
                         say just a minute ago? Why'd you 
                         want to save me?

                                     CLARENCE
                         That's what I was sent down for. I'm 
                         your guardian angel.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Ridiculous of you to think of killing 
                         yourself for money. Eight thousand 
                         dollars.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Yeah... just things like that. Now 
                         how'd you know that?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I told you  I'm your guardian angel. 
                         I know everything about you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, you look about like the kind 
                         of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen 
                         angel, aren't you? What happened to 
                         your wings?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I haven't won my wings yet. That's 
                         why I'm an angel Second Class.

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know whether I like it very 
                         much being seen around with an angel 
                         without any wings.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll 
                         help me, won't you?

                                     GEORGE
                              (humoring him)
                         Sure, sure. How?

                                     CLARENCE
                         By letting me help you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Only one way you can help me. You 
                         don't happen to have eight thousand 
                         bucks on you?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, no, no. We don't use money in 
                         Heaven.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. 
                         Comes in pretty handy down here, 
                         bub.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, tut, tut, tut.

                                     GEORGE
                         I found it out a little late. I'm 
                         worth more dead than alive.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Now look, you mustn't talk like that. 
                         I won't get my wings with that 
                         attitude. You just don't know all 
                         that you've done. If it hadn't been 
                         for you...

                                     GEORGE
                              (interrupts)
                         Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, 
                         everybody'd be a lot better off. My 
                         wife, and my kids and my friends.
                              (annoyed with Clarence)
                         Look, little fellow, go off and haunt 
                         somebody else, will you?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No, you don't understand. I've got 
                         my job...

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         Aw, shut up, will you.

               Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces 
               across the room, thoughtfully.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to himself)
                         Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy.
                              (to George)
                         So you still think killing yourself 
                         would make everyone feel happier, 
                         eh?

                                     GEORGE
                              (dejectedly)
                         Oh, I don't know. I guess you're 
                         right. I suppose it would have been 
                         better if I'd never been born at 
                         all.

                                     CLARENCE
                         What'd you say?

                                     GEORGE
                         I said I wish I'd never been born.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, you mustn't say things like that.  
                         You...
                              (gets an idea)
                         ...wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
                         That's an idea.
                              (glances up toward 
                              Heaven)
                         What do you think? Yeah, that'll do 
                         it.  All right.
                              (to George)
                         You've got your wish. You've never 
                         been born.

               As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside 
               the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the 
               door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (looking upward)
                         You don't have to make all that fuss 
                         about it.

               As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring 
               his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what 
               Clarence has said.

                                     GEORGE
                         What did you say?

                                     CLARENCE
                         You've never been born. You don't 
                         exist.  You haven't a care in the 
                         world.

               George feels his ear as Clarence talks.

                                     CLARENCE
                         No worries  no obligations  no 
                         eight thousand dollars to get  no 
                         Potter looking for you with the 
                         Sheriff.

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

               George indicates his bad ear.

                                     GEORGE
                         Say something else in that ear.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (bending down)
                         Sure. You can hear out of it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, that's the doggonedest thing... 
                         I haven't heard anything out of that 
                         ear since I was a kid. Must have 
                         been that jump in the cold water.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, 
                         George.

               George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut 
               he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you know about that... What's 
                         happened?

                                     MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
                         George looks around, as though to 
                         get his bearings.

                                     GEORGE
                         It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?  
                         What's happened here?
                              (standing up)
                         Come on, soon as these clothes of 
                         ours are dry...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Our clothes are dry.

               George feels the clothes on the line.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you know about that? Stove's 
                         hotter than I thought. Now, come on, 
                         get your clothes on, and we'll stroll 
                         up to my car and get...

               They start dressing. George interrupts himself.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.

                                     GEORGE
                         You haven't got your wings. Yeah, 
                         that's right.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               This is the same empty street where George's car swerved 
               into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come 
               into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car 
               smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car 
               is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.

                                     CLARENCE
                         What's the matter?

                                     GEORGE
                              (puzzled)
                         Well, this is where I left my car 
                         and it isn't here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You have no car.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I had a car, and it was right 
                         here.  I guess somebody moved it.

               CLOSE SHOT  AT CURB

               The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages 
               under his arm.

                                     OWNER
                              (politely)
                         Good evening.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?

                                     OWNER
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     GEORGE
                         My car, my car. I'm the fellow that 
                         owns the car that ran into your tree.

                                     OWNER
                         What tree?

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, what tree? This 
                         tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a 
                         big gash in the side of it here.

               The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then 
               straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.

                                     OWNER
                         You must mean two other trees. You 
                         had me worried. One of the oldest 
                         trees in Pottersville.

                                     GEORGE
                              (blankly)
                         Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford 
                         Falls.

                                     OWNER
                         I mean Pottersville.
                              (sharply)
                         Don't you think I know where I live?  
                         What's the matter with you?

               The owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely 
               bewildered.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my 
                         nut, or he is...
                              (to Clarence)
                         ...or you are!

                                     CLARENCE
                         It isn't me!

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, maybe I left the car up at 
                         Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.

               He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the 
               road.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (as they go)
                         Clarence!

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful 
               Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking 
               joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People 
               are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the 
               bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the 
               difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up 
               to the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                              (as they come in)
                         That's all right. Go on in. Martini's 
                         a good friend of mine.

               Two people leave the bar as they approach.

                                     GEORGE
                         There's a place to sit down. Sit 
                         down.

                                     MEDIUM CLOSEUP
                         Nick is wiping off the bar as they 
                         sit down.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

                                     NICK
                         You want a martini?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is 
                         he?

                                     NICK
                              (impatient)
                         Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink 
                         or don't you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay  all right. Double bourbon, 
                         quick, huh?

                                     NICK
                         Okay.
                              (to Clarence)
                         What's yours?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I was just thinking...
                              (face puckers up with 
                              delicious anticipation)
                         It's been so long since I...

                                     NICK
                              (impatient)
                         Look, mister, I'm standing here 
                         waiting for you to make up your mind.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (appreciatively)
                         That's a good man. I was just thinking 
                         of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not 
                         cold enough for that. Not nearly 
                         cold enough...  Wait a minute... 
                         wait a minute... I got it. Mulled 
                         wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light 
                         on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, 
                         and be lively!

                                     NICK
                         Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks 
                         in here for men who want to get drunk 
                         fast.  And we don't need any 
                         characters around to give the joint 
                         atmosphere. Is that clear?  Or do I 
                         have to slip you my left for a 
                         convincer?

               As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his 
               left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by 
               this conduct.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to George)
                         What's he talking about?

                                     GEORGE
                              (soothingly)
                         Nick  Nick, just give him the same 
                         as mine. He's okay.

                                     NICK
                         Okay.

               Nick turns away to get the drinks.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter with him. I never 
                         saw Nick act like that before.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You'll see a lot of strange things 
                         from now on.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you 
                         worry me. You got someplace to sleep?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't huh? Well, you got any 
                         money?

               Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.

                                     CLARENCE
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         No wonder you jumped in the river.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I jumped in the river to save you so 
                         I could get my wings.

               Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, that's right.

               A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the 
               SOUND of the bell.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Made what?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Every time you hear a bell ring, it 
                         means that some angel's just got his 
                         wings.

               George glances up at Nick.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, I think maybe you better not 
                         mention getting your wings around 
                         here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Why? Don't they believe in angels?

                                     GEORGE
                              (looking at Nick)
                         A... Yeah, but... you know...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Then why should they be surprised 
                         when they see one?

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Nick)
                         He never grew up. He's...
                              (to Clarence)
                         How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Two hundred and ninety-three...
                              (thinks)
                         ...next May.

               Nick slams the bottle down on the counter.

                                     NICK
                         That does it! Out you two pixies go, 
                         through the door or out the window!

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, Nick. What's wrong?

                                     NICK
                              (angrily)
                         And that's another thing. Where do 
                         you come off calling me Nick?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't 
                         it?

                                     NICK
                         What's that got to do with it? I 
                         don't know you from Adam's off ox.
                              (sees someone come in)
                         Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come 
                         here!

               CLOSE SHOT

               A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a 
               broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand.

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE

               He can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist.

               BACK TO SHOT  NICK AT THE BAR

                                     NICK
                              (to Gower)
                         Didn't I tell you never to come 
                         panhandling around here?

               Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the 
               face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly 
               as the soda runs off his face.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George 
                         Bailey! Don't you know me?

                                     GOWER
                         No. No.

                                     NICK
                              (to his bouncers)
                         Throw him out. Throw him out.

               The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes 
               back to the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... 
                         Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

                                     NICK
                         You know, that's another reason for 
                         me not to like you. That rumhead 
                         spent twenty years in jail for 
                         poisoning a kid. If you know him, 
                         you must be a jailbird yourself.
                              (to his bouncers)
                         Would you show these gentlemen to 
                         the door.

                                     BOUNCER
                         Sure. This way, gentlemen.

               EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in 
               the snow.

               INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.

                                     NICK
                         Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!

               EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, 
               puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they 
               landed, looking at each other.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You see, George, you were not there 
                         to stop Gower from putting that poison 
                         into the...

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, I wasn't there? I 
                         remember distinctly...

               George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with 
               the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" 
               instead of "MARTINI'S."

               George and Clarence get to their feet.

                                     GEORGE
                              (exasperated)
                         What the... hey, what's going on 
                         around here?  Why, this ought to be 
                         Martini's place.

               He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort 
               of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested 
               look.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, who are you?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (patiently)
                         I told you, George. I'm your guardian 
                         angel.

               George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his 
               arm.  It's flesh.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. 
                         What else are you? What... are you a 
                         hypnotist?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No, of course not.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well then, why am I seeing all these 
                         strange things?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Don't you understand, George? It's 
                         because you were not born.

                                     GEORGE
                         Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

                                     CLARENCE
                         You're nobody. You have no identity.

               George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but 
               without success.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, no identity? My 
                         name's George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE
                         There is no George Bailey. You have 
                         no papers, no cards, no driver's 
                         license, no 4-F card, no insurance 
                         policy...
                              (he says these things 
                              as George searches 
                              for them)
                         George looks in his watch pocket.

                                     CLARENCE
                         They're not there, either.

                                     GEORGE
                         What?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Zuzu's petals.

               George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You've been given a great gift, 
                         George. A chance to see what the 
                         world would be like without you.

               George is completely befuddled.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shaking his head)
                         Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute 
                         here. As, this is some sort of a 
                         funny dream I'm having here. So long, 
                         mister, I'm going home.

               He starts off. Clarence rises.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Home? What home?

                                     GEORGE
                              (furious)
                         Now shut up! Cut it out! You're...  
                         you're... you're crazy! That's what 
                         I think... you're screwy, and you're 
                         driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing 
                         things. I'm going home and see my 
                         wife and family. Do you understand 
                         that? And I'm going home alone!

               George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, 
               glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.

                                     CLARENCE
                         How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks.
                              (pause)
                         No, I didn't have a drink!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE

               The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." 
               George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street 
               toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH 
               him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where 
               before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become 
               in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS 
               of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and 
               the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority 
               of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque 
               house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, 
               and so on.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George stops before what used to be the offices of the 
               Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the 
               entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people 
               are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and 
               dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw 
               into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey... hey. Where did the Building 
                         and Loan move to?

                                     COP
                         The Building and what?

                                     GEORGE
                         The Bailey Building and Loan. It was 
                         up there.

                                     COP
                         They went out of business years ago.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as 
               a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Violet!
                              (to the cop)
                         Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!

                                     COP
                         I know. I know.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know that girl!

               The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees 
               Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Ernie  Ernie!

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!

                                     ERNIE
                              (a much harder Ernie)
                         Where do you live?

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't 
                         you start pulling that stuff. You 
                         know where I live. Three-twenty 
                         Sycamore. Now hurry up.

                                     ERNIE
                         Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?...

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

                                     ERNIE
                         All right.  He pulls down the flag 
                         on the meter and starts the cab.

               INT. CAB  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE

               Ernie is puzzled by the stranger.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look here, Ernie, straighten me out 
                         here.  I've got some bad liquor or 
                         something.  Listen to me now. Now, 
                         you are Ernie Bishop, and you live 
                         in Bailey Park with your wife and 
                         kid? That's right, isn't it?

                                     ERNIE
                              (suspiciously)
                         You seen my wife?

                                     GEORGE
                              (exasperated)
                         Seen your wife? I've been to your 
                         house a hundred times.

                                     ERNIE
                         Look, bud, what's the idea?  I live 
                         in a shack in Potter's Field and my 
                         wife ran away three years ago and 
                         took the kid...  And I ain't never 
                         seen you before in my life.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay. Just step on it. Just get me 
                         home.

               Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger. 
               As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing 
               beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions 
               to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. 
               Bert gets into his car and follows.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house.

                                     ERNIE
                         Is this the place?

                                     GEORGE
                         Of course it's the place.

                                     ERNIE
                         Well, this house ain't been lived in 
                         for twenty years.

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house.  
               Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof 
               has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. 
               Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.

               EXT. CAB  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and 
               Ernie stand watching George's actions.

                                     BERT
                         What's up, Ernie?

                                     ERNIE
                         I don't know, but we better keep an 
                         eye on this guy. He's bats.

               Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the 
               beam toward the old house.

               INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, 
               by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging 
               and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice 
               that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!  
                         Where are you?

               Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.

                                     CLARENCE
                         They're not here, George. You have 
                         no children.

                                     GEORGE
                              (ignoring him)
                         Where are you?
                              (then, to Clarence)
                         What have you done with them?

               INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. 
               Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.

                                     BERT
                         All right, put up your hands. No 
                         fast moves. Come on out here, both 
                         of you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert! Thank heaven you're here!

               He rushes toward Bert.

                                     BERT
                         Stand back.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, what's happened to this house?  
                         Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

                                     ERNIE
                              (warningly)
                         Watch him, Bert.

                                     BERT
                         Come on, come on.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with 
                         you two guys? You were here on my 
                         wedding night. You, both of you, 
                         stood out here on the porch and sung 
                         to us, don't you remember?

                                     ERNIE
                              (nervously)
                         Think I'd better be going.

                                     BERT
                         Look, now why don't you be a good 
                         kid and we'll take you in to a doctor.  
                         Everything's going to be all right.

               Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George 
               struggles with him, trying to explain.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will 
                         you take me over to my mother's house? 
                         Bert, listen!
                              (gesturing to Clarence)
                         It's that fellow there  he says 
                         he's an angel  he's tried to 
                         hypnotize me.

                                     BERT
                         I hate to do this, fella.

               Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does 
               so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, 
               forcing him to let George go.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Run... George! Run, George!

               George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert 
               grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, 
               wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on 
               Clarence.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Help! Joseph, help!

                                     BERT
                         Oh, shut up!

                                     CLARENCE
                         Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!

               Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert 
               gets up, amazed by his vanishing.

                                     BERT
                         Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had 
                         him right here.

               Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright.

                                     ERNIE
                              (stammering)
                         I need a drink.

               He runs out of the scene.

                                     BERT
                         Well, which way'd they go? Help me 
                         find 'em.

               EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George runs up the path to the front door of the house and 
               raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, 
               when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: 
               "Ma Bailey's Boarding House."

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR

               The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but 
               she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In 
               her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold 
               suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Well?

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother...

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Mother? What do you want?

               It is a cruel blow to George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother, this is George. I thought 
                         sure you'd remember me.

                                     MA BAILEY
                              (coldly)
                         George who? If you're looking for a 
                         room there's no vacancy.

               She starts to close the door, but George stops her.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.  
                         Something terrible's happened to me. 
                         I don't know what it is. Something's 
                         happened to everybody. Please let me 
                         come in. Keep me here until I get 
                         over it.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Get over what? I don't take in 
                         strangers unless they're sent here 
                         by somebody I know.

                                     GEORGE
                              (desperate)
                         Well, I know everybody you know. 
                         Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

                                     MA BAILEY
                              (suspiciously)
                         You know him?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, sure I do.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         When'd you see him last?

                                     GEORGE
                         Today, over at the house.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         That's a lie. He's been in the insane 
                         asylum ever since he lost his 
                         business.  And if you ask me, that's 
                         where you belong.

               She slams the door shut in George's face.

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out 
               to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features 
               are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see 
               Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his 
               volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life 
                         touches so many other lives, and 
                         when he isn't around he leaves an 
                         awful hole, doesn't he?

                                     GEORGE
                              (quietly, trying to 
                              use logic)
                         I've heard of things like this. You've 
                         got me in some kind of a spell, or 
                         something.  Well, I'm going to get 
                         out of it. I'll get out of it. I 
                         know how, too. I... the last man I 
                         talked to before all this stuff 
                         started happening to me was Martini.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You know where he lives?

                                     GEORGE
                         Sure I know where he lives. He lives 
                         in Bailey Park.

               They walk out of scene.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey 
               Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, 
               with graves where the houses used to be.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. 
                         All I know is this should be Bailey 
                         Park. But where are the houses?

               The two walk into the cemetery.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (as they go)
                         You weren't here to build them.

               CLOSE MOVING SHOT

               George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, 
               Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare 
               with frightened eyes at:

               CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE

               Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George 
               scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, 
               and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY  
               1911-1919"

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke 
                         through the ice and was drowned at 
                         the age of nine.

               George jumps up.

                                     GEORGE
                         That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to 
                         war! He got the Congressional Medal 
                         of Honor! He saved the lives of every 
                         man on that transport.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (sadly)
                         Every man on that transport died. 
                         Harry wasn't there to save them 
                         because you weren't there to save 
                         Harry. You see, George, you really 
                         had a wonderful life.  Don't you see 
                         what a mistake it would be to throw 
                         it away?

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Yes, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Where's Mary?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, well, I can't...

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know how you know these 
                         things, but tell me  where is she?

               George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I...

                                     GEORGE
                         If you know where she is, tell me 
                         where my wife is.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I'm not supposed to tell.

                                     GEORGE
                              (becoming violent)
                         Please, Clarence, tell me where she 
                         is.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You're not going to like it, George.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouting)
                         Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                         She's an old maid. She never married.

                                     GEORGE
                              (choking him)
                         Where's Mary? Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                         She's...

                                     GEORGE
                         Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (in self-defense)
                         She's just about to close up the 
                         library!

               George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the 
               ground, where he rubs his neck.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to himself)
                         There must be some easier way for me 
                         to get my wings.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. LIBRARY  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see 
               George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different 
                no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love 
               of life.  Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close 
               to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-
               satisfied and efficient.

               CLOSEUP

               George, as he watches her.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary, on the sidewalk.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

               She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues 
               on.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

               Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary!

               He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a 
               tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary, it's George! Don't you know 
                         me?  What's happened to us?

                                     MARY
                              (struggling)
                         I don't know you! Let me go!

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to 
                         me.  Please, Mary, help me. Where's 
                         our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me, 
                         Mary!

               Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door 
               she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar.

               INT. BLUE MOON  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many 
               of the people are the same who were present during the run 
               on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming. 
               The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically 
               insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouting)
                         Mary...
                              (to men holding him)
                         Let me go! Mary, don't run away!

                                     MAN
                         Somebody call the police!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         Hit him with a bottle!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         He needs a strait jacket!

                                     MARY
                              (from back of room)
                         That man  stop him!

                                     GEORGE
                              (recognizing some of 
                              them)
                         Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!

               Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a 
               couple of women at the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

                                     MAN
                         Oh, no you don't!

                                     GEORGE
                              (screaming)
                         Mary!

               George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperately 
               he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?

               EXT. SIDEWALK  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his 
               police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into 
               George as he comes out.

                                     BERT
                         Oh, it's you!

               He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the 
               button, knocking him down, then continues running down the 
               street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun 
               and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.

                                     BERT
                              (to crowd)
                         Stand back!

               Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets 
               off in pursuit of George.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The same part of the bridge where George was standing before 
               Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through 
               this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is 
               frantically looking for Clarence.

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. 
                         Get me back. Get me back. I don't 
                         care what happens to me. Only get me 
                         back to my wife and kids. Help me, 
                         Clarence, please!  Please! I want to 
                         live again!

               George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.

                                     GEORGE
                         I want to live again. I want to live 
                         again. Please, God, let me live again.

               George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind 
               dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE SOBBING AT THE RAILING

               The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert 
               comes into scene.

                                     BERT
                         Hey, George! George! You all right?

               George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again.

                                     BERT
                         Hey, what's the matter?

                                     GEORGE
                              (warningly)
                         Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll 
                         hit you again! Get out!

                                     BERT
                         What the Sam Hill you yelling for, 
                         George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't... George?

               George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly  
               George's mouth is bleeding again.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, do you know me?

                                     BERT
                         Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been 
                         looking all over town trying to find 
                         you.  I saw your car piled into that 
                         tree down there, and I thought 
                         maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding; 
                         are you sure you're all right?

                                     GEORGE
                         What did...

               George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth 
               with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds.

                                     GEORGE
                              (joyously)
                         My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's 
                         bleed...
                              (feeling in watch 
                              pocket)
                         Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're...  
                         they're here, Bert! What do you know 
                         about that? Merry Christmas!

               He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at 
               top speed toward town.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes 
               running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, 
               pats the car, and dashes on.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by 
               the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Bedford Falls!

               He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street 
               of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in 
               its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the 
               street

                                     GEORGE

               CLOSE SHOT

               Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. 
               George pounds on the window.

                                     GEORGE
                              (from outside)
                         Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

               George runs off as Potter looks up from his work.

                                     POTTER

               INT. GEORGE'S HOME  NIGHT

               The lights are on. There is a fire in the fireplace. The 
               Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked 
               around.

               INT. ENTRANCE HALL  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and 
               photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for 
               George. George comes dashing in the front door.

                                     GEORGE
                              (excitedly)
                         Mary...

                         Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!

               He grabs his hand and shakes it.

                                     CARTER
                              (surprised)
                         Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit!

                                     GEORGE
                         I know. Eight thousand dollars.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (reaching into pocket)
                         George, I've got a little paper here.

                                     GEORGE
                              (happily)
                         I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.  
                         Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas!

               The photographer sets off a flash bulb.

                                     GEORGE
                         Reporters? Where's Mary?
                              (calling)
                         Mary!

               George runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. As he goes:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty 
                         house! Mary! Mary!

               He comes running back to the hall.

                                     GEORGE
                         Have you seen my wife?

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in 
               their pajamas.

                                     GEORGE
                         Kids!

               George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar 
               knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it 
               lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs.

                                     GEORGE
                         Pete  kids  Janie  Tommy.

                         Where's your mother?

                         She went looking for you with Uncle 
                         Billy.

               Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom. George crushes her to 
               him.

                                     ZUZU
                         Daddy!

               Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce 
               embrace.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary!

                         George, darling! Where have you been?

               George and Mary embrace tearfully.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, George, George, George.

                         Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're 
                         real!

                                     MARY
                         Oh, George, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         You have no idea what's happened to 
                         me.

                                     MARY
                         You have no idea what happened...

               He stops her with a kiss. She leads him excitedly down the 
               stairs.

                                     MARY
                         Well, come on, George, come on 
                         downstairs quick. They're on their 
                         way.

                                     GEORGE

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on 
               his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree.

                                     MARY
                         Come on in here now. Now, you stand 
                         right over here, by the tree. Right 
                         there, and don't move, don't move. I 
                         hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle! 
                         It's a miracle!

               She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS 
               of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, 
               covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with 
               money, bursts in. He is followed by Ernie, and about twenty 
               more townspeople.

                                     MARY
                         Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In 
                         here!

               Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room. A 
               table stands in front of George. George picks up Zuzu to 
               protect her from the mob. Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of 
               money out onto the table  the money overflows and falls all 
               over.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Isn't it wonderful?

               The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and 
               smiles.  Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, 
               in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table  
               pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but 
               lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. 
               More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of 
               "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out 
               its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George 
               stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he 
               sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.  Tears 
               course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets 
               them.

                              (emotionally at the 
                              breaking point)
                         Mary did it, George! Mary did it! 
                         She told a few people you were in 
                         trouble and they scattered all over 
                         town collecting money.  They didn't 
                         ask any questions  just said: "If 
                         George is in trouble  count on me." 
                         You never saw anything like it.

               Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes.

                                     TOM
                         What is this, George? Another run on 
                         the bank?

               Charlie adds his money to the pile.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

               Ernie is trying to get some system into the chaos.

                                     ERNIE
                         The line forms on the right.

               Mr. Martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with 
               cash.

                                     ERNIE
                         Mr. Martini! Merry Christmas! Step 
                         right up here.

               Martini dumps his money on the table.

                                     MARTINI
                         I busted the juke-box, too!

               Mr. Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes.

                                     ERNIE
                         Mr. Gower!

                                     GOWER
                              (to George)
                         I made the rounds of my charge 
                         accounts.

               Violet Bick arrives, and takes out the money George had given 
               her for her trip to New York.

                                     GEORGE
                         Violet Bick!

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not going to go, George. I changed 
                         my mind.

               Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long 
               black stocking.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've been saving this money for a 
                         divorce, if ever I get a husband.

               Mr. Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor.

                                     PARTRIDGE
                         There you are, George. I got the 
                         faculty all up out of bed.
                              (hands his watch to 
                              Zuzu)
                         And here's something for you to play 
                         with.

                                     MAN
                              (giving money)
                         I wouldn't have a roof over my head 
                         if it wasn't for you, George.

               Ernie is reading a telegram he has just received.

                                     ERNIE
                         Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. 
                         Quiet  quiet. Now, this is from 
                         London.
                              (reading)
                         Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop. 
                         My office instructed to advance you 
                         up to twenty-five thousand dollars. 
                         Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas. 
                         Sam Wainwright.

               The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on 
               top of the pile of money on the table.

                                     MARY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

               As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and 
               glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. 
               She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the 
               entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS 
               of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are 
               still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, 
               the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly 
               looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In 
               the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, 
               accompanied by Bert, the cop.

                                     HARRY
                         Hello, George, how are you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Harry... Harry...

                                     HARRY
                              (as he sees the money)
                         Mary  looks like I got here too 
                         late.

                                     BERT
                         Mary, I got him here from the airport 
                         as quickly as I could. The fool flew 
                         all the way up here in a blizzard.

               Mrs. Bailey enters scene.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Harry, how about your banquet in New 
                         York?

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, I left right in the middle of it 
                         as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

               Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.

                                     HARRY
                         Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my 
                         big brother, George. The richest man 
                         in town!

               Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie 
               at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld 
               Lang syne," and everyone joins in.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the 
               pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top 
               of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's 
               copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription 
               written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure 
               who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."

                                     MARY
                              (looking at book)
                         What's that?

                                     GEORGE
                         That's a Christmas present from a 
                         very dear friend of mine.

               At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of 
               the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver 
               bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery 
               tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the 
               bell.

                                     ZUZU
                         Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every 
                         time a bell rings an angel gets his 
                         wings.

                                     GEORGE
                              (smiling)
                         That's right, that's right.

               He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.

                                     GEORGE
                         Attaboy, Clarence.

               The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo 
               for the

               NIGHT SEQUENCE

               Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town 
               of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets 
               are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over 
               the above scenes we hear voices praying:

                                     GOWER'S VOICE
                         I owe everything to George Bailey. 
                         Help him, dear Father.

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                         Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend 
                         Mr. Bailey.

                                     MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE
                         Help my son George tonight.

                                     BERT'S VOICE
                         He never thinks about himself, God; 
                         that's why he's in trouble.

                                     ERNIE'S VOICE
                         George is a good guy. Give him a 
                         break, God.

                                     MARY'S VOICE
                         I love him, dear Lord. Watch over 
                         him tonight.

                                     JANIE'S VOICE
                         Please, God. Something's the matter 
                         with Daddy.

                                     ZUZU'S VOICE
                         Please bring Daddy back.

               CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through 
               the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly 
               toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we 
               hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice 
               is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Hello, Joseph, trouble?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Looks like we'll have to send someone 
                         down  a lot of people are asking 
                         for help for a man named George 
                         Bailey.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his 
                         crucial night. You're right, we'll 
                         have to send someone down immediately. 
                         Whose turn is it?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's why I came to see you, sir. 
                         It's that clock-maker's turn again.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings 
                         yet, has he? We've passed him up 
                         right along.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Because, you know, sir, he's got the 
                         I.Q. of a rabbit.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Yes, but he's got the faith of a 
                         child  simple. Joseph, send for 
                         Clarence.

               A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It 
               twinkles as Clarence speaks:

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         You sent for me, sir?

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth 
                         needs our help.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Splendid! Is he sick?

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         No, worse. He's discouraged. At 
                         exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, 
                         Earth time, that man will be thinking 
                         seriously of throwing away God's 
                         greatest gift.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've 
                         only got an hour to dress. What are 
                         they wearing now?

                         You will spend that hour getting 
                         acquainted with George Bailey.

                         Sir... If I should accomplish this 
                         mission  I mean  might I perhaps 
                         win my wings?  I've been waiting for 
                         over two hundred years now, sir  
                         and people are beginning to talk.

                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
                         What's that book you've got there?

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

                         Clarence, you do a good job with 
                         George Bailey, and you'll get your 
                         wings.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Poor George... Sit down.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Sit down? What are...

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         If you're going to help a man, you 
                         want to know something about him, 
                         don't you?

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Well, naturally. Of course.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Well, keep your eyes open. See the 
                         town?

               The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, 
               indistinguishable blur is seen.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Where? I don't see a thing.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your 
                         wings yet. Now look, I'll help you 
                         out.  Concentrate. Begin to see 
                         something?

               The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a 
               group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Why, yes. This is amazing.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         If you ever get your wings, you'll 
                         see all by yourself.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, wonderful!

               EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT

               Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on 
               large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out 
               onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.

                                     BOY
                              (as he slides)
                         Yippee!!

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Hey, who's that?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's your problem, George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         A boy?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's him when he was twelve, back 
                         in 1919. Something happens here you'll 
                         have to remember later on.

               Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the 
               hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others 
               applaud.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George Bailey at bottom of slide.

                                     GEORGE
                              (through megaphone)
                         And here comes the scare-baby, my 
                         kid brother, Harry Bailey.

               CLOSE SHOT  HARRY

               On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.

                                     HARRY
                         I'm not scared.

                                     BOYS
                              (ad lib)
                         Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by 
               the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice 
               at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears 
               into the water.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm coming, Harry.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to 
               pull him out he yells:

                                     GEORGE
                         Make a chain, gang! A chain!

               WIDER ANGLE

               The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. 
               When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they 
               pull them both to safety.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         George saved his brother's life that 
                         day.  But he caught a bad cold which 
                         infected his left ear. Cost him his 
                         hearing in that ear. It was weeks 
                         before he could return to his after-
                         school job at old man Gower's 
                         drugstore.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, 
               whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate 
               horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the 
               street.

               MEDIUM PAN SHOT

               The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly 
               man riding in it.

               CLOSE SHOT

               The boys watching the carriage.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Potter!

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Who's that  a king?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's Henry F. Potter, the richest 
                         and meanest man in the county.

               The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The 
               drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored 
               water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:

                                     GEORGE
                         So long!

                                     BOYS
                              (ad lib)
                         Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee-
                         haw.

               INTERIOR DRUGSTORE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter 
               on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:

                                     GEORGE
                         Wish I had a million dollars.

               He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog!

               WIDER ANGLE

               George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, 
               a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get 
               his apron from behind the fountain.

                                     GEORGE
                              (calling toward back 
                              room)
                         It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. 
               We see him take a drink from a bottle.

                                     GOWER
                         You're late.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools 
               at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same 
               age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.

                                     VIOLET
                              (with warm friendliness)
                         Hello, George.
                              (then, flatly, as she 
                              sees Mary)
                         'Lo, Mary.

                                     MARY
                              (primly)
                         Hello, Violet.

               George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are 
               two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy 
               counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Two cents worth of shoelaces?

                                     VIOLET
                         She was here first.

                                     MARY
                         I'm still thinking.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Violet)
                         Shoelaces?

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Georgie.

               George goes over to the candy counter.

                                     VIOLET
                              (to Mary)
                         I like him.

                                     MARY
                         You like every boy.

                                     VIOLET
                              (happily)
                         What's wrong with that?

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are.

               George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice 
               shoelaces.  Violet gives him the money.

                                     VIOLET
                              (the vamp)
                         Help me down?

                                     GEORGE
                              (disgusted)
                         Help you down!

               Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, 
               sticks out her tongue as she passes.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN

                                     GEORGE
                         Made up your mind yet?

                                     MARY
                         I'll take chocolate.

               George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.

                                     GEORGE
                         With coconuts?

                                     MARY
                         I don't like coconuts.

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't like coconuts!  Say, 
                         brainless, don't you know where 
                         coconuts come from?  Lookit here  
                         from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral 
                         Sea!

               He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.

                                     MARY
                         A new magazine! I never saw it before.

                                     GEORGE
                         Of course you never. Only us explorers 
                         can get it. I've been nominated for 
                         membership in the National Geographic 
                         Society.

               He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf 
               ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary, whispering.

                                     MARY
                         Is this the ear you can't hear on? 
                         George Bailey, I'll love you till 
                         the day I die.

               She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she 
               has said.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going out exploring some day, 
                         you watch. And I'm going to have a 
                         couple of harems, and maybe three or 
                         four wives.  Wait and see.

               He turns back to the cash register, whistling.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. 
               Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, 
               chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It 
               is evident he has been drinking.

                                     GOWER
                         George! George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     GOWER
                         You're not paid to be a canary.

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir.

               He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open 
               telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he 
               starts to read it.

               INSERT: THE TELEGRAM

               It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, 
               died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything 
               possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions 
               from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE."

               BACK TO SHOT

               George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses 
               itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the 
               ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward 
               Gower.

               INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT

               Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower, do you want something...  
                         Anything?

                                     GOWER
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         Anything I can do back here?

                                     GOWER
                         No.

               George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite 
               drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the 
               floor.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.

               BACK TO SHOT

               George and Gower.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'll get them, sir.

               He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower 
               waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in 
               his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. 
               George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the 
               powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George 
               stands still, horrified.

                                     GOWER
                         Take these capsules over to Mrs. 
                         Blaine's.  She's waiting for them.

               George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or 
               say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. 
               George's fingers fumble.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria 
                         there, haven't they, sir?

                                     GOWER
                         Ummmm...

               Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns 
               to him, the box in his hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is it a charge, sir?

                                     GOWER
                         Yes  charge.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower, I think...

                                     GOWER
                         Aw, get going!

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he 
               sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says:

               "ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL

               BACK TO SHOT

               With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the 
               street. Mary follows him with her eyes.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-
               story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building 
               and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting 
               at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.

               INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY

               FULL SHOT

               The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There 
               is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a 
               door marked:

               "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, 
               obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a 
               very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With 
               him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a 
               waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and 
               Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with 
               an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly 
               toward his father's office.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to 
               enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where 
                         you headin'?

                                     GEORGE
                         Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Some other time, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         It's important.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         There's a squall in there that's 
                         shapin' up into a storm.

               During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, 
               and now she calls out:

                                     COUSIN TILLY

               Uncle Billy looking at his hand.

                         Bank examiner!  I should have called 
                         him yesterday. Switch it inside.

               He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George 
               stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs 
               of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more 
               keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his 
               father's office and enters.

               INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing 
               swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle 
               man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other 
               people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind 
               which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits 
               Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The 
               following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument 
               had been in process for some time.

                                     BAILEY
                         I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

                                     POTTER
                         Well, you're begging, and that's a 
                         whole lot worse.

                                     BAILEY
                         All I'm asking is thirty days more...

                              (to Potter)
                         Just thirty short days. I'll dig up 
                         that five thousand somehow.

                         Shove me up...

               Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.

                                     GEORGE

                         those people of yours to pay those 
                         mortgages?

                         Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of 
                         these people are out of work.

                         hardskulled character? You have no 
                         family  no children. You can't begin 
                         to spend all the money you've got.

                                     POTTER
                         So I suppose I should give it to 
                         miserable failures like you and that 
                         idiot brother of yours to spend for 
                         me.

               George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his 
               father. He comes around in front of the desk.

                                     GEORGE
                         He's not a failure! You can't say 
                         that about my father!

               He pushes George toward the door.

               As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's 
               shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand.

                         Bigger'n everybody.

               George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on 
               his shoulder. As they go:

                         five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

               He hangs up the phone and turns to George.

                                     GOWER
                         Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

               He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back 
               room.

                                     GEORGE
                         Capsules...

                                     GOWER
                              (shaking him)
                         Did you hear what I said?

                                     GEORGE
                              (frightened)
                         Yes, sir, I...

               Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open 
               hands.  George tries to protect himself as best he can.

                                     GOWER
                         What kind of tricks are you playing, 
                         anyway? Why didn't you deliver them 
                         right away? Don't you know that boy's 
                         very sick?

                                     GEORGE
                              (in tears)
                         You're hurting my sore ear.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she 
               hears George being slapped, she winces.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND GOWER

                                     GOWER
                         You lazy loafer!

                                     GEORGE
                              (sobbing)
                         Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're 
                         doing. You put something wrong in 
                         those capsules. I know you're unhappy. 
                         You got that telegram, and you're 
                         upset. You put something bad in those 
                         capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. 
                         Gower...

               George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely 
               rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy 
               venomously.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just look and see what you did. Look 
                         at the bottle you took the powder 
                         from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's 
                         poison!  I know you feel bad... and...

               George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower 
               looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced 
               on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder 
               out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then 
               abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to 
               look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. 
               Gower steps toward him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't hurt my sore ear again.

               But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, 
               sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is 
               crying too.

                                     GOWER
                         No... No... No...

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't hurt my ear again!

                                     GOWER
                              (sobbing)
                         Oh, George, George...

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. 
                         I know what you're feeling. I won't 
                         ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I 
                         won't.

                                     GOWER
                         Oh, George.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LUGGAGE SHOP  DAY  (1928)

               MEDIUM SHOT

               It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an 
               assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, 
               the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase.

                                     JOE
                         An overnight bag  genuine English 
                         cowhide, combination lock, fitted up 
                         with brushes, combs...

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Nope.

               AS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our 
               first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP 
               to a CLOSEUP by now.

                                     GEORGE
                         Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, 
                         Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big 
                         one.

               Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms 
               outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes 
               a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from 
               Heaven:

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         What did you stop it for?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         I want you to take a good look at 
                         that face.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Who is it?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Oh, you mean the kid that had his 
                         ears slapped back by the druggist.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         That's the kid.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         It's a good face. I like it. I like 
                         George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever 
                         tell anyone about the pills?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Not a soul.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Did he ever marry the girl? Did he 
                         ever go exploring?

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Well, wait and see.

               CLOSE SHOT  THE SCREEN

               The arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again.

                                     GEORGE
                         Big - see!  I don't want one for one 
                         night.  I want something for a 
                         thousand and one nights, with plenty 
                         of room for labels from Italy and 
                         Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big 
                         one. 

                                     JOE
                         I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't 
                         suppose you'd like this old second-
                         hand job, would you?

               He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could 
                         use this as a raft in case the boat 
                         sunk. How much does this cost?

                                     JOE
                         No charge.

                                     GEORGE
                         That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded 
                         as if you said no charge.

                                     JOE
                              (indicating name on 
                              suitcase)
                         That's right.

                                     GEORGE
                              (as he sees his name)
                         What's my name doing on it?

                                     JOE
                         A little present from old man Gower. 
                         Came down and picked it out himself.

                                     GEORGE
                              (admiring the bag)
                         He did? Whatta you know about that  
                         my old boss...

                                     JOE
                         What boat you sailing on?

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm working across on a cattle boat.

                                     JOE
                         A cattle boat?

                                     GEORGE
                              (as he exits)
                         Okay, I like cows.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The place is practically the same except that it is now full 
               of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little 
               tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the 
               local small fry.  There are now three kids jerking sodas.  
               Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored. 
               He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face 
               lights up when he sees George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks 
                         ever so much for the bag. It's just 
                         exactly what I wanted.

                                     GOWER
                         Aw, forget it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, it's wonderful.

                                     GOWER
                         Hope you enjoy it.

               George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter. 
               He closes his eyes and makes a wish.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... Oh. Wish I had a million 
                         dollars.

               As he snaps the lighter the flame springs up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog!

               George shakes Gower's hand vigorously and exits.

               PAN SHOT as George crosses the street, Uncle Billy, cousin 
               Tilly and Cousin Eustace are leaning out of the second floor 
               window of the Building and Loan offices.

                         Avast there, Captain Cook. You got 
                         your sea legs yet?

                         some of them picture postcards, will 
                         you, George?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Hey, George, don't take any plugged

                         Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.  
                         George waves up at them and continues 
                         on across the street.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               As George crosses the street. He spots Ernie and his cab, 
               and Bert the motor cop, parked alongside.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Ernie!

                                     ERNIE
                         Hiya, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Hi, Bert.

                                     BERT
                         George...

                                     GEORGE
                         Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How 
                         about driving me home in style?

               Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase 
               inside.

                                     ERNIE
                         Sure, your highness, hop in. And, 
                         for the carriage trade, I puts on my 
                         hat.

               As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he 
               sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward 
               him. Her walk and figure would stop anybody. She gives him a 
               sultry look.

               The three men by the cab, but including Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. 
                         That's some dress you got on there.

               CLOSE SHOT  VIOLET

               She reacts to this.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, this old thing? Why, I only wear 
                         it when I don't care how I look.

               CAMERA PANS WITH HER AS VIOLET SWINGS ON DOWN THE SIDEWALK.

               REVERSE SHOT  CAB

               As Violet goes by, George and Bert raise their heads above 
               the top of the cab.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               On Violet's back as she goes. As she crosses the street, an 
               elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car 
               that pulls up with screeching brakes.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND BERT AT CAB

               Ernie sticks his head out form the driver's seat.

                                     ERNIE
                         How would you like...

                                     GEORGE
                              (as he enters cab)
                         Yes...

                                     ERNIE
                         Want to come along, Bert?  We'll 
                         show you the town!

               Bert looks at his watch, then takes another look at Violet's 
               retreating figure.

                                     BERT
                         No, thanks. Think I'll go home and 
                         see what the wife's doing.

                                     ERNIE
                         Family man.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAILEY DINING ROOM  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table. Mrs. Bailey and 
               Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling. There 
               are SOUNDS of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs. Annie 
               pounds on the ceiling with a broom.

                                     MOTHER
                              (calling out)
                         George! Harry! You're shaking the 
                         house down! Stop it!

                                     POP
                         Oh, let 'em alone. I wish I was up 
                         there with them.

                                     MOTHER
                         Harry'll tear his dinner suit. George!

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Mrs. Bailey is calling up the stairs.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's why all children should be 
                         girls.

                                     MOTHER
                         But if they were all girls, there 
                         wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
                              (calling upstairs)
                         George! Harry! Come down to dinner 
                         this minute. Everything's getting 
                         cold and you know we've been waiting 
                         for you.

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         Okay, Mom.

               She goes up the stairs.  Pop is smiling and poking his plate. 
               A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare 
               MUSIC. Down they come, holding their mother high between 
               them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and 
               deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap.

                                     BOYS
                         Here's a present for you, Pop.

               Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns 
               with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down 
                         and have dinner.

                                     HARRY
                         I've eaten.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well, aren't you going to finish 
                         dressing for your graduation party? 
                         Look at you.

                                     HARRY
                         I don't care. It's George's tux.

               Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out 
               for her.

                                     ANNIE
                         If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit 
                         you with this broom.

                                     HARRY
                         Annie, I'm in love with you. There's 
                         a moon out tonight.

               As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny. 
               She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George 
               and his mother sit down at the table.

                                     GEORGE
                         Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal 
                         at the old Bailey boarding house.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door.

                                     HARRY
                         Pop, can I have the car? I'm going 
                         to take over a lot of plates and 
                         things.

                                     MOTHER
                         What plates?

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats 
                         committee and we only need a couple 
                         of dozen.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my 
                         best Haviland.

               She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. 
               As she goes:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and his father, eating at the table. There is a great 
               similarity and a great understanding between them.

                                     POP
                         Hope you have a good trip, George. 
                         Uncle Billy and I are going to miss 
                         you.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. 
                         What's the matter? You look tired.

                                     POP
                         Oh, I had another tussle with Potter 
                         today.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

                                     POP
                         I thought when we put him on the 
                         Board of Directors, he'd ease up on 
                         us a little bit.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wonder what's eating that old money 
                         grubbing buzzard anyway?

                                     POP
                         Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and 
                         sick.  Sick in his mind, sick in his 
                         soul, if he has one. Hates everybody 
                         that has anything that he can't have. 
                         Hates us mostly, I guess.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, 
               Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his 
               head.  CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross.

                                     HARRY
                         Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.

                                     POP
                         So long, son.

                                     GEORGE
                         Got a match?

                                     HARRY
                         Very funny. Very funny.

                                     MOTHER
                         Put those things in the car and I'll 
                         get your tie and studs together.

                                     HARRY
                         Okay, Mom. You coming later? You 
                         coming later, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, and be bored to 
                         death?

                                     HARRY
                         Couldn't want a better death. Lots 
                         of pretty girls, and we're going to 
                         use that new floor of yours tonight, 
                         too.

                                     GEORGE
                         I hope it works.

                                     POP
                         No gin tonight, son.

                                     HARRY
                         Aw, Pop, just a little.

                                     POP
                         No, son, not one drop.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes.

                                     ANNIE
                         Boys and girls and music. Why do 
                         they need gin?

               She exits.

                                     GEORGE
                         Father, did I act like that when I 
                         graduated from high school?

                                     POP
                         Pretty much. You know, George, wish 
                         we could send Harry to college with 
                         you. Your mother and I talked it 
                         over half the night.

                                     GEORGE
                         We have that all figured out. You 
                         see, Harry'll take my job at the 
                         Building and Loan, work there four 
                         years, then he'll go.

                                     POP
                         He's pretty young for that job.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, no younger than I was.

                                     POP
                         Maybe you were born older, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

                                     POP
                         I say, maybe you were born older. I 
                         suppose you've decided what you're 
                         going to do when you get out of 
                         college.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, well, you know what I've always 
                         talked about  build things... design 
                         new buildings  plan modern cities  
                         all that stuff I was talking about.

                                     POP
                         Still after that first million before 
                         you're thirty.

                                     GEORGE
                         No, I'll settle for half that in 
                         cash.

               Annie comes in again from the kitchen.

                                     POP
                         Of course, it's just a hope, but you 
                         wouldn't consider coming back to the 
                         Building and Loan, would you?

               Annie stops serving to hear his answer.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I...
                              (to Annie)
                         Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?  
                         Then you'd be more comfortable and 
                         you could hear everything that's 
                         going on.

                                     ANNIE
                         I would if I thought I'd hear anything 
                         worth listening to.

                                     GEORGE
                         You would, huh?

               She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. 
               Bailey smiles and turns to George.

                                     POP
                         I know it's soon to talk about it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't 
                         face being cooped up for the rest of 
                         my life in a shabby little office.

               He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean 
                         that remark, but this business of 
                         nickels and dimes and spending all 
                         your life trying to figure out how 
                         to save three cents on a length of 
                         pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do 
                         something big and something important.

                                     POP
                              (quietly)
                         You know, George, I feel that in a 
                         small way we are doing something 
                         important.  Satisfying a fundamental 
                         urge. It's deep in the race for a 
                         man to want his own roof and walls 
                         and fireplace, and we're helping him 
                         get those things in our shabby little 
                         office.

                                     GEORGE
                              (unhappily)
                         I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But 
                         I've been hoarding pennies like a 
                         miser in order to... Most of my 
                         friends have already finished college. 
                         I just feel like if I don't get away, 
                         I'd bust.

                                     POP
                         Yes... Yes... You're right, son.

                                     GEORGE
                         You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

                                     POP
                         This town is no place for any man 
                         unless he's willing to crawl to 
                         Potter. You've got talent, son. You 
                         get yourself an education. Then get 
                         out of here.

                                     GEORGE
                         Pop, do you want a shock? I think 
                         you're a great guy.

               To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door 
               and calls:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Annie listening through glass in door.

                                     ANNIE
                         I heard it. About time one of you 
                         lunkheads said it.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and his father at the table.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I 
                         think I'll get dressed and go over 
                         to Harry's party.

                                     POP
                         Have a good time, son.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               At one end of the room an orchestra is playing. George wends 
               his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table. 
               He and Harry are carrying plates and pies.

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are.

               Several of the boys take the plates from him. George looks 
               at them, feeling very grown up and out of place.

                                     HARRY
                              (introducing George)
                         You know my kid brother, George. I'm 
                         going to put him through college.

               Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at 
               his ears as he talks.

                                     SAM
                         Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!

               George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including Sam and Marty Hatch. Sam is assured and breezy, 
               wearing very collegiate clothes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? 
                         When did you get here?

                                     SAM
                         Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd 
                         give the kids a treat.

                                     GEORGE
                         Old college graduate now, huh?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, 
                         they call me. Well, freshman, looks 
                         like you're going to make it after 
                         all.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yep.

               Sam sees Harry and leaves George in the middle of a gesture.

                                     SAM
                              (to Harry)
                         Harry! You're the guy I want to see. 
                         Coach has heard all about you.

                                     HARRY
                         He has?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah. He's followed every game and 
                         his mouth's watering. He wants me to 
                         find out if you're going to come 
                         along with us.

                                     HARRY
                         Well, I gotta make some dough first.

                                     SAM
                         Well, you better make it fast. We 
                         need great ends like you  not broken 
                         down old guys like this one.

               George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting 
               each other.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hee-haw!

                                     SAM
                         Hee-haw!

               An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         George, welcome back.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Putting a pool under this floor was 
                         a great idea. Saved us another 
                         building.  Now, Harry, Sam, have a 
                         lot of fun.  There's lots of stuff 
                         to eat and drink.  Lots of pretty 
                         girls around.

               Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George. 
               She is waving her dance program at him.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hey, George...

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, what am I bid?

               Marty Hatch enters scene.

                                     MARTY
                         George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home 
                         week.

                                     MARTY
                         Do me a favor, will you, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     MARTY
                         Well, you remember my kid sister, 
                         Mary?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, yeah, yeah.

                                     SAM
                         "Momma wants you, Marty." "Momma 
                         wants you, Marty." Remember?

                                     MARTY
                         Dance with her, will you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny 
                         enough already, with all these kids.

                                     MARTY
                         Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance 
                         with her one time and you'll give 
                         her the thrill of her life.

                                     SAM
                         Aw, go on.

                                     MARTY
                              (calling off)
                         Hey, sis.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be 
                         long, Marty. I don't want to be a 
                         wet nurse for...

               He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her.

               CLOSEUP  MARY HATCH

               She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass 
               of punch in her hand. For the first time, she is wearing an 
               evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration 
               of the boy with her. She turns around and for the first time 
               she sees George.  For a second she loses her poise, staring 
               at him.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         And the next thing I know, some guy 
                         came up and tripped me. That's the 
                         reason why I came in fourth. If it 
                         hadn't been for that...

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, staring at Mary.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         ...that race would have been a cinch. 
                         I tried to find out who it was 
                         later...

               CLOSEUP  MARY

               Still staring at George, and smiling.

                                     FREDDIE'S VOICE
                         ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd 
                         ever tell you whoever it was because 
                         they'd be scared. They know...

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George.

                                     FREDDIE
                         ...what kind of...

                                     MARTY
                              (interrupting)
                         You remember George? This is Mary. 
                         Well, I'll be seeing you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well... Well... Well...

                                     FREDDIE
                         Now, to get back to my story, see...

               Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start 
               dancing.

                                     FREDDIE
                         Hey, this is my dance!

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, why don't you stop annoying 
                         people?

                                     FREDDIE
                         Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

               MOVING SHOT

               Following George and Mary as they dance.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, hello.

                                     MARY
                         Hello. You look at me as if you didn't 
                         know me.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I don't.

                                     MARY
                         You've passed me on the street almost 
                         every day.

                                     GEORGE
                         Me?

                                     MARY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-uh. That was a little girl named 
                         Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

               A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops.

                         Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big 
                         Charleston contest. The prize? A 
                         genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped 
                         by the judges will remain on the 
                         floor. Let's go!

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

               As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, 
               they look at each other.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm not very good at this.

                                     MARY
                         Neither am I.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay  what can we lose?

               They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of 
               various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad.

               CLOSEUP  FREDDIE

               Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking 
               daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too 
               many, is beside him.

                                     MICKEY
                         What's the matter, Othello  jealous? 
                         Did you know there's a swimming pool 
                         under this floor? And did you know 
                         that button behind you causes this 
                         floor to open up?  And did you further 
                         know that George Bailey is dancing 
                         right over that crack?  And I've got 
                         the key?

               Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns 
               the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each 
               half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. 
               Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so 
               engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers 
               and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals 
               an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are 
               so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. 
               Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for 
               cheers.

                         They're cheering us. We must be good.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move 
               backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and 
               fall into the pool below.

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the 
               crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap 
               into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally 
               clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               EXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George 
               is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants 
               that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath 
               robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle 
               that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera 
               we hear them singing:

                                     GEORGE AND MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals can't you come out 
                         tonight.  Can't you come out tonight. 
                         Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo 
                         Gals can't you come out tonight and 
                         dance by the light of the moon.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hot dog! Just like an organ.

                                     MARY
                         Beautiful.

               CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         And I told Harry I thought I'd be 
                         bored to death. You should have seen 
                         the commotion in that locker room. I 
                         had to knock down three people to 
                         get this stuff we're wearing here. 
                         Here, let me hold that old wet dress 
                         of yours.

               He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look 
               at each other.

                                     MARY
                         Do I look as funny as you do?

                                     GEORGE
                         I guess I'm not quite the football 
                         type.  You... look wonderful. You 
                         know, if it wasn't me talking I'd 
                         say you were the prettiest girl in 
                         town.

                                     MARY
                         Well, why don't you say it?

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know. Maybe I will say it. 
                         How old are you anyway?

                                     MARY
                         Eighteen.

                                     GEORGE
                         Eighteen? Why, it was only last year 
                         you were seventeen.

                                     MARY
                         Too young or too old?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits 
                         you.  Yes, sir, you look a little 
                         older without your clothes on.

               Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly 
               on:

                                     GEORGE
                         I mean, without a dress. You look 
                         older...  I mean, younger. You look 
                         just...

               In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's 
               bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers 
               the robe around her.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh-oh...

                                     MARY
                              (holding out her hand)
                         Sir, my train, please.

                                     GEORGE
                         A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

               He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm.

                                     GEORGE
                         Your... your caboose, my lady.

                                     MARY
                         You may kiss my hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Ummmmm...

               Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey  hey, Mary.

               Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals":

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         As I was lumbering down the street...

               George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the 
                         old Granville house.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE

               It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that 
               once was no doubt resplendent.

                                     GEORGE
                         No. You see, you make a wish and 
                         then try and break some glass. You 
                         got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, 
                         too.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of 
                         romance, that old place. I'd like to 
                         live in it.

                                     GEORGE
                         In that place?

                                     MARY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. 
                         Now watch... right on the second 
                         floor there.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT  OLD HOUSE

               George hurls the rock at the house. We hear the SOUND of a 
               window breaking.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair 
               on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass.

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         What'd you wish, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, not just one wish. A whole 
                         hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going 
                         to do tomorrow and the next day and 
                         the next year and the year after 
                         that. I'm shaking the dust of this 
                         crummy little town off my feet and 
                         I'm going to see the world. Italy, 
                         Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. 
                         Then I'm coming back here and go to 
                         college and see what they know... 
                         and then I'm going to build things. 
                         I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm 
                         gonna build skyscrapers a hundred 
                         stories high. I'm gonna build bridges 
                         a mile long...

               As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally 
               stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Are you gonna throw a rock?

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more 
               we hear the SOUND of breaking glass.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you 
                         wish, Mary?

               Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off 
               down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after 
               her.

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals, can't you come out 
                         tonight...

               George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the 
               street.

                                     MARY AND GEORGE
                              (singing)
                         ...can't you come out tonight, can't 
                         you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals 
                         can't you come out tonight and dance 
                         by the light of the moon.

                                     GEORGE
                         What'd you wish when you threw that 
                         rock?

               They have stopped walking and now face one another.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, no.

                                     GEORGE
                         Come on, tell me.

                                     MARY
                         If I told you it might not come true.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is it you want, Mary? What do 
                         you want? You want the moon? Just 
                         say...

               LONG SHOT

               Full moon shining through the trees.

               BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         ...the word and I'll throw a lasso 
                         around it and pull it down. Hey, 
                         that's a pretty good idea. I'll give 
                         you the moon, Mary.

                                     MARY
                         I'll take it. And then what?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, then you could swallow it and 
                         it'd all dissolve, see? And the 
                         moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers 
                         and your toes, and the ends of your 
                         hair.
                              (pauses)
                         Am I talking too much?

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH OF HOUSE

               As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair:

                                     MAN
                         Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead 
                         of talking her to death?

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  MAN ON PORCH

                                     MAN
                         Why don't you kiss her instead of 
                         talking her to death?

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         Want me to kiss her, huh?

               CLOSE SHOT  PORCH OF HOUSE

                                     MAN
                         Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong 
                         people.

               As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his 
               house, slamming the front door.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come 
                         on back out here, and I'll show you 
                         some kissing that'll put hair back 
                         on your head. What are you...

               Mary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on 
               the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes 
               off.

                                     GEORGE
                              (looking around)
                         Mary...

               He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He 
               cannot see her anywhere.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, I give up. Where are you?

               CLOSEUP  BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK

               We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves.

                                     MARY
                         Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

               George walks toward the bush.

                                     GEORGE
                         Here you are. Catch.

               He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes 
               him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Wait a minute. What am I doing? This 
                         is a very interesting situation.

                                     MARY
                              (from the bushes)
                         Please give me my robe.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmm... A man doesn't get in a 
                         situation like this every day.

                                     MARY
                              (impatiently)
                         I'd like to have my robe.

                                     GEORGE
                         Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

               Mary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say:

                                     MARY
                         Ouch!

                                     GEORGE
                         Gesundheit. This requires a little 
                         thought here.

                                     MARY
                              (getting mad)
                         George Bailey! Give me my robe!

                                     GEORGE
                         I've heard about things like this, 
                         but I've never...

                                     MARY
                              (interrupting)
                         Shame on you. I'm going to tell your 
                         mother on you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, my mother's way up the corner 
                         there.

                                     MARY
                              (desperate)
                         I'll call the police.

                                     GEORGE
                         They're way downtown. They'd be on 
                         my side, too.

                                     MARY
                         I'm going to scream!

                                     GEORGE
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's 
                         see. No, the point is, in order to 
                         get this robe...  I've got it! I'll 
                         make a deal with you, Mary.

               Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile 
               drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside 
               him.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         George! George! Come on home, quick! 
                         Your father's had a stroke!

               George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the 
               car.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to 
                         go.

                                     HARRY
                         Come on, George, let's hurry.

                                     GEORGE
                         Did you get a doctor?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Yes, Campbell's there now.

               CLOSEUP  THE HYDRANGEA BUSH

               As the car drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises up 
               from the bush and follows the car with her eyes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               EXT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN SIGN OVER ENTRANCE

               INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING

               There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. 
               They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. 
               Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate 
               salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. 
               Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George 
               are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is 
               Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on 
               which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors 
               there are individual reports for them to study.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         I think that's all we'll need you 
                         for, George. I know you're anxious 
                         to make a train.

                                     GEORGE
                              (rising)
                         I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         I want the Board to know that George 
                         gave up his trip to Europe to help 
                         straighten things out here these 
                         past few months.  Good luck to you 
                         at school, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thanks.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         Now we come to the real purpose of 
                         this meeting  to appoint a successor 
                         to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

                                     POTTER
                         Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my 
                         real purpose.

                                     MAN
                         Wait just a minute now.

                                     POTTER
                         Wait for what?  I claim this 
                         institution is not necessary to this 
                         town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I 
                         make a motion to dissolve this 
                         institution and turn its assets and 
                         liabilities over to the receiver.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (angrily)
                         George, you hear what that buzzard...

                                     LAWYER
                         Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after 
                         Peter Bailey's death to discuss 
                         chloroforming the Building and Loan.

                                     MAN
                         Peter Bailey died three months ago. 
                         I second Mr. Potter's motion.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         Very well. In that case I'll ask the 
                         two executive officers to withdraw.

               Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy 
               start to collect their papers and leave the table.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         But before you go, I'm sure the whole 
                         board wishes to express its deep 
                         sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thank you very much.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         It was his faith and devotion that 
                         are responsible for this organization.

                                     POTTER
                         I'll go further than that. I'll say 
                         that to the public Peter Bailey was 
                         the Building and Loan.

               Everyone looks at him surprised.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (trying to control 
                              himself)
                         Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from 
                         you, considering that you probably 
                         drove him to his grave.

                                     POTTER
                         Peter Bailey was not a business man.  
                         That's what killed him. Oh, I don't 
                         mean any disrespect to him, God rest 
                         his soul.  He was a man of high 
                         ideals, so-called, but ideals without 
                         common sense can ruin this town.
                              (picking up papers 
                              from table)
                         Now, you take this loan here to Ernie 
                         Bishop... You know, that fellow that 
                         sits around all day on his brains in 
                         his taxi.  You know... I happen to 
                         know the bank turned down this loan, 
                         but he comes here and we're building 
                         him a house worth five thousand 
                         dollars. Why?

               George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and 
               papers, ready to leave.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. 
                         You have all the papers there. His 
                         salary, insurance. I can personally 
                         vouch for his character.

                                     POTTER
                              (sarcastically)
                         A friend of yours?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         You see, if you shoot pool with some 
                         employee here, you can come and borrow 
                         money. What does that get us? A 
                         discontented, lazy rabble instead of 
                         a thrifty working class. And all 
                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers 
                         like Peter Bailey stir them up and 
                         fill their heads with a lot of 
                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...

               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, 
               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just a minute  just a minute. Now, 
                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right 
                         when you say my father was no business 
                         man. I know that. Why he ever started 
                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and 
                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither 
                         you nor anybody else can say anything 
                         against his character, because his 
                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-
                         five years since he and Uncle Billy 
                         started this thing, he never once 
                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, 
                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough 
                         money to send Harry to school, let 
                         alone me. But he did help a few people 
                         get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. 
                         And what's wrong with that? Why...  
                         Here, you're all businessmen here. 
                         Doesn't it make them better citizens? 
                         Doesn't it make them better customers? 
                         You... you said... What'd you say 
                         just a minute ago?... They had to 
                         wait and save their money before 
                         they even ought to think of a decent 
                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until 
                         their children grow up and leave 
                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-
                         down that they... Do you know how 
                         long it takes a working man to save 
                         five thousand dollars?  Just remember 
                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble 
                         you're talking about... they do most 
                         of the working and paying and living 
                         and dying in this community. Well, 
                         is it too much to have them work and 
                         pay and live and die in a couple of 
                         decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my 
                         father didn't think so. People were 
                         human beings to him, but to you, a 
                         warped, frustrated old man, they're 
                         cattle. Well, in my book he died a 
                         much richer man than you'll ever be!

                                     POTTER
                         I'm not interested in your book. I'm 
                         talking about the Building and Loan.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know very well what you're talking 
                         about. You're talking about something 
                         you can't get your fingers on, and 
                         it's galling you. That's what you're 
                         talking about, I know.
                              (to the Board)
                         Well, I've said too much. I... You're 
                         the Board here. You do what you want 
                         with this thing. Just one thing more, 
                         though. This town needs this measly 
                         one-horse institution if only to 
                         have some place where people can 
                         come without crawling to Potter. 
                         Come on, Uncle Billy!

               George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.  
               Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man" 
               remark was gall in his veins.

                                     POTTER
                         Sentimental hogwash! I want my 
                         motion...

               He is interrupted by a babble of talk, as the directors take 
               up the argument

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers. He 
               is worried about the outcome of the meeting. Dissolving the 
               Building and Loan will alter his plans. Uncle Billy follows 
               him around, chattering.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him, 
                         George, old boy. You shut his big 
                         mouth.

                         You should have heard him.

                         What happened? We heard a lot of 
                         yelling.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Well, we're being voted out of 
                         business after twenty-five years.

                              (looking at his watch)
                         Yeah, I'll be right down.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Hey, you'll miss your train. You're 
                         a week late for school already. Go 
                         on.

                                     GEORGE

                         I wonder what's going on in there?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, never mind. Don't worry about 
                         that.  They're putting us out of 
                         business. So what? I can get another 
                         job. I'm only fifty-five.

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                         Fifty-six!

                         Go on  go on. Hey, look, you gave 
                         up your boat trip, now you don't 
                         want to miss college too, do you?

               Dr. Campbell comes running out, all excited.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         George! George! They voted Potter 
                         down!  They want to keep it going!

               Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly and Uncle Billy cheer wildly. 
               Dr. Campbell and George shake hands.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Whoopee!

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         But they've got one condition  only 
                         one condition.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         That's the best part of it. They've 
                         appointed George here as executive 
                         secretary to take his father's place.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         You can keep him on. That's all right. 
                         As secretary you can hire anyone you 
                         like.

                         Dr. Campbell, now let's get this 
                         thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm 
                         leaving right now. I'm going to 
                         school. This is my last chance. Uncle 
                         Billy here, he's your man.

                                     DR. CAMPBELL
                         But, George, they'll vote with Potter 
                         otherwise.

               peanuts as George paces up and down in front of him.

                         Well, if it isn't old George 
                         Geographic Explorer Bailey! What? No 
                         husky dogs? No sled?
                              (to Uncle Billy)
                         Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a 
                         bit.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Nobody ever changes around here. You 
                         know that.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, am I glad to see you.

                                     HARRY
                         Say, where's Mother?

                                     GEORGE
                         She's home cooking the fatted calf. 
                         Come on, let's go.

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute.

               CLOSE SHOT

               The group, including Ruth Dakin. This is the young lady who 
               came off the train with Harry. In the excitement of greetings 
               she has been momentarily forgotten. She stands, smiling, 
               waiting.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         How do you do.

                                     HARRY
                         Ruth Dakin.

                                     RUTH
                         Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

               George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Huh?

                                     HARRY
                         Well, I wired you I had a surprise. 
                         Here she is. Meet the wife.

               George is thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Well, what do you know  wife.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, how do you do. Congratulations.  
                         Congratulations. What am I doing?

               He kisses Ruth.  CAMERA MOVES WITH them down the platform.

                                     GEORGE
                         Harry, why didn't you tell somebody?
                              (to Ruth)
                         What's a pretty girl like you doing 
                         marrying this two-headed brother of 
                         mine?

                                     RUTH
                              (smiling)
                         Well, I'll tell you. It's purely 
                         mercenary. My father offered him a 
                         job.

               George stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth 
               continue out of shot. Harry stops with George.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (as he moves off)
                         Oh, he gets you and a job? Well, 
                         Harry's cup runneth over.

                                     HARRY
                         George... about that job. Ruth spoke 
                         out of turn. I never said I'd take 
                         it. You've been holding the bag here 
                         for four years, and... well, I won't 
                         let you down, George.  I would like 
                         to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot 
                         the bags. I'll be right back.

               He runs out of the shot, George watching him.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking 
               deeply.

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         It was a surprise to me. This is the 
                         new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. 
                         Old, old friend of the family.

                                     RUTH'S VOICE
                         Oh, of course. I've heard him speak 
                         of you.

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         And I want to tell you, we're going 
                         to give the biggest party this town 
                         ever saw.

               CAMERA MOVES WITH George as he comes into the scene. Ruth 
               detaches herself from the group and offers George some 
               popcorn.

                                     RUTH
                              (to George)
                         Here, have some popcorn. George, 
                         George, George... that's all Harry 
                         ever talks about.

                                     GEORGE
                              (quietly)
                         Ruth, this... what about this job?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, well, my father owns a glass 
                         factory in Buffalo. He wants to get 
                         Harry started in the research 
                         business.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is it a good job?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a 
                         good future, you know. Harry's a 
                         genius at research. My father fell 
                         in love with him.

                                     GEORGE
                         And you did, too?

               Ruth nods, smiling.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH  BAILEY HOME  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group 
               assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group 
               breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, 
               leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND UNCLE BILLY

               The latter is tipsy. He feels very high.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so 
                         good I could spit in Potter's eye. I 
                         think I will. What did you say, huh? 
                         Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

               He looks around for his hat, which is on his head.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Where's my hat? Where's my...

               George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to 
               him.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, thank you, George. Which one is 
                         mine?

                                     GEORGE
                              (laughing)
                         The middle one.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old 
                         boy.  Now, look  if you'll point me 
                         in the right direction... would you 
                         do that?  George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Right down here.

               They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle 
               around and heads him down the street.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

                                     GEORGE
                         Now you just turn this way and go 
                         right straight down.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         That way, huh?

               He staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we 
               hear Uncle Billy singing "My Wild Irish Rose." There is a 
               CRASH of cans and bottles, then:

                                     UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE
                         I'm all right. I'm all right. "... 
                         the sweetest flower that grows... "

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George is standing at the garden gate. He takes some travel 
               folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. 
               He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. 
               His mother comes out of the house and kisses him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mom.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                              (as she kisses him)
                         That's for nothing. How do you like 
                         her?

               She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a 
               crowd of other couples, are dancing to the MUSIC of a 
               phonograph, and can be seen through the front door.

                                     GEORGE
                         She's swell.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Looks like she can keep Harry on his 
                         toes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Did you know that Mary Hatch is back 
                         from school?

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Came back three days ago.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Nice girl, Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Kind that will help you find the 
                         answers, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Oh, stop that grunting.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hmmm...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Can you give me one good reason why 
                         you shouldn't call on Mary?

                                     GEORGE
                         Sure  Sam Wainwright.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Hmmm?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Well, she's not crazy about him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, how do you know? Did she discuss 
                         it with you?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well then, how do you know?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, 
                         she lights up like a firefly whenever 
                         you're around.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         And besides, Sam Wainwright's away 
                         in New York, and you're here in 
                         Bedford Falls.

                                     GEORGE
                         And all's fair in love and war?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                              (primly)
                         I don't know about war.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother, you know, I can see right 
                         through you  right back to your 
                         back collar button... trying to get 
                         rid of me, huh?

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Uh-huh.

               They kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, here's your hat, what's your 
                         hurry?  All right, Mother, old 
                         Building and Loan pal, I think I'll 
                         go out and find a girl and do a little 
                         passionate necking.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Oh, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, if you'll just point me in the 
                         right direction... This direction?
                              (as he leaves)
                         Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George is standing in the middle of the street, hands in his 
               pockets. As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a 
               moment.  He is obviously undecided as to what he wants to 
               do.

               EXT. VIOLET BICK'S BEAUTY SHOP  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Violet is locking up for the night. A couple of men are 
               crowding around her, each one bent on taking her out. There 
               is laughter, kidding and pawing. She looks up and sees George 
               standing there.

                                     VIOLET
                              (to the two men)
                         Excuse me...

                                     MAN
                         Now, wait a minute.

                                     VIOLET
                         I think I got a date. But stick 
                         around, fellows, just in case, huh?

                                     MAN
                         We'll wait for you, baby.

               CAMERA PANS WITH Violet as she crosses the street to George.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Vi.

               He looks her over. Violet takes her beauty shop seriously 
               and she's an eyeful. She senses the fact that George is far 
               from immune to her attractions. She links her arm in his and 
               continues on down the street with him.

               CLOSE MOVING SHOT  GEORGE AND VIOLET

                                     VIOLET
                         What gives?

                                     GEORGE
                         Nothing.

                                     VIOLET
                         Where are you going?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'll probably end up down at the 
                         library.

               They stop walking and face one another.

                                     VIOLET
                         George, don't you ever get tired of 
                         just reading about things?

               Her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him. 
               He is silent for a moment, then blurts out:

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes... what are you doing tonight?

                                     VIOLET
                              (feigned surprise)
                         Not a thing.

                                     GEORGE
                         Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night 
                         of it.

                                     VIOLET
                              (just what she wanted)
                         Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we 
                         do?

                                     GEORGE
                         Let's go out in the fields and take 
                         off our shoes and walk through the 
                         grass.

                                     VIOLET
                         Huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         Then we can go up to the falls. It's 
                         beautiful up there in the moonlight, 
                         and there's a green pool up there, 
                         and we can swim in it. Then we can 
                         climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the 
                         pines, and watch the sunrise against 
                         the peaks, and... we'll stay up there 
                         the whole night, and everybody'll be 
                         talking and there'll be a terrific 
                         scandal...

                                     VIOLET
                              (interrupting)
                         George, have you gone crazy? Walk in 
                         the grass in my bare feet? Why, it's 
                         ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.

                                     GEORGE
                         Shhh...

                                     VIOLET
                              (angrily)
                         You think just because you...

               By this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above 
               scene.  Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and 
               George is trying to quiet her. Finally:

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay, just forget about the whole 
                         thing.

               As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter, and we

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares 
               meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking 
               ahead.  But after a few steps he turns around and starts 
               back. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts 
               back again.

               INT. BEDROOM WINDOW  HATCH HOME  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back 
               and forth.

                                     MARY
                         What are you doing, picketing?

               George stops, startled, and looks up.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Mary. I just happened to be 
                         passing by.

                                     MARY
                         Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up 
                         your mind?

                                     GEORGE
                         How's that?

                                     MARY
                         Have you made up your mind?

                                     GEORGE
                         About what?

                                     MARY
                         About coming in. Your mother just 
                         phoned and said you were on your way 
                         over to pay me a visit.

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               George looks surprised at this.

                                     GEORGE
                         My mother just called you? Well, how 
                         did she know?

                                     MARY
                         Didn't you tell her?

                                     GEORGE
                         I didn't tell anybody. I just went 
                         for a walk and happened to be passing 
                         by...

               But Mary has disappeared from the window.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to himself)
                         What do you... went for a walk, that's 
                         all.

               INT. HATCH HOME  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               Mary is running down the stairs.

                                     MARY
                              (calling off)
                         I'll be downstairs, mother.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         All right, dear.

               Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes 
               her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs 
               into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel.

               INSERT: THE SKETCH

               It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the 
               moon.  Lettering on the drawing says: "George Lassos The 
               Moon."

               BACK TO SHOT

               Mary runs into the hall, opens the phonograph and puts on a 
               record of "Buffalo Gals."  Then she opens the front door and 
               stands there waiting for George.

               INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George is struggling with the gate  he finally kicks it 
               open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Well, are you coming in or aren't 
                         you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I'll come in for a minute, but 
                         I didn't tell anybody I was coming 
                         over here.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary and George are in the entrance hall.

                                     GEORGE
                         When did you get back?

                                     MARY
                         Tuesday.

                                     GEORGE
                         Where'd you get that dress?

                                     MARY
                         Do you like it?

                                     GEORGE
                         It's all right. I thought you'd go 
                         back to New York like Sam and Ingie, 
                         and the rest of them.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, I worked there for a couple of 
                         vacations, but I don't know... I 
                         guess I was homesick.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shocked)
                         Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, and my family and... oh, 
                         everything.  Would you like to sit 
                         down?

               They go through the doorway into the parlor.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, for a minute. I still 
                         can't understand it though. You know 
                         I didn't tell anybody I was coming 
                         here.

                                     MARY
                         Would you rather leave?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, I don't want to be rude.

                                     MARY
                         Well, then, sit down.

               George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a 
               close look at it.

                                     GEORGE
                              (indicating cartoon)
                         Some joke, huh?

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary sitting on the divan. He is uncomfortable, 
               and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I see it still smells like 
                         pine needles in here.

                                     MARY
                         Thank you.

               There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing 
               with the phonograph record which has been playing all through 
               the above scene:

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         "And dance by the light..."

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah...

               He looks at his watch, as though about to leave.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I...

                                     MARY
                              (desperately)
                         It was nice about your brother Harry, 
                         and Ruth, wasn't it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

                                     MARY
                         Don't you like her?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, of course I like her. She's a 
                         peach.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, it's just marriage in general 
                         you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, marriage is all right for Harry, 
                         and Marty, and Sam and you.

               Mrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe, and with her hair in curlers, is 
               leaning over the banister as she calls:

                                     MRS. HATCH
                         Mary! Mary!

               George and Mary seated on the divan.

                         Who's down there with you?

                                     MARY
                         It's George Bailey, Mother.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         George Bailey? What's he want?

                                     MARY
                         I don't know.
                              (to George)
                         What do you want?

                                     GEORGE
                              (indignant)
                         Me? Not a thing. I just came in to 
                         get warm.

                                     MARY
                              (to mother)
                         He's making violent love to me, 
                         Mother.

               George is aghast.

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE
                         You tell him to go right back home, 
                         and don't you leave the house, either. 
                         Sam Wainwright promised to call you 
                         from New York tonight.

                                     GEORGE
                              (heatedly)
                         But your mother needn't... you know 
                         I didn't come here to... to... to...

                                     MARY
                              (rising)
                         What did you come here for?

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know. You tell me. You're 
                         supposed to be the one that has all 
                         the answers.  You tell me.

                                     MARY
                              (terribly hurt)
                         Oh, why don't you go home?

                                     GEORGE
                              (almost shouting)
                         That's where I'm going. I don't know 
                         why I came here in the first place! 
                         Good night!

               As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts 
               ringing.

                                     MARY
                              (to George)
                         Good night!

                                     MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               Mary comes into the hall.

                                     MARY
                              (almost weeping)
                         I'll get it.

               As Mary comes into the hall, she stops by the phonograph, 
               which is still playing "Buffalo Gals," takes off the record 
               with a jerk, and smashes it against the machine. The phone 
               is still ringing.

                                     MRS. HATCH
                         Mary, he's waiting!

                                     MARY
                         Hello.

               As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front 
               porch.

                                     GEORGE
                         I forgot my hat.

                                     MARY
                              (overly enthusiastic)
                         Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Aw, great. Gee, it's good to hear 
                         your voice again.

               George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of 
                         you, Sam.

                              sees George still 
                              there)
                         There's an old friend of yours here.  
                         George Bailey.

                                     SAM
                         You mean old moss-back George?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, old moss-back George.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Hee-haw! Put him on.

                                     MARY
                         Wait a minute. I'll call him.
                              (calling)
                         George!

                                     MRS. HATCH
                         He doesn't want to speak to George, 
                         you idiot!

                                     MARY
                         He does so. He asked for him.
                              (calling)
                         Geo... George, Sam wants to speak to 
                         you.

               She hands the instrument to George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Sam.

                         fine pal you are. What're you trying

                              (into phone)
                         What do you mean? Nobody's trying to 
                         steal your girl. Here... here's Mary.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I 
                         want to talk to both of you. Tell 
                         Mary to get on the extension.

                              (to Mary)
                         Here. You take it. You tell him.

               CLOSE SHOT  MRS. HATCH

               As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone 
               on which she has been listening.

               BACK TO SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

                                     MARY
                         We can both hear. Come here.

               Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of 
               necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very 
               conscious of her proximity.

                                     MARY
                              (on phone)
                         We're listening, Sam.

                         I have a big deal coming up that's 
                         going to make us all rich. George, 
                         you remember that night in Martini's 
                         bar when you told me you read 
                         someplace about making plastics out 
                         of soybeans?

                                     GEORGE
                         Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans. 
                         Yeah.

                         Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. 
                         He's going to build a factory outside 
                         of Rochester. How do you like that?

               Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious 
               of her, close to him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Well, why not? Can you think of 
                         anything better?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I don't know... why not right 
                         here?  You remember that old tool 
                         and machinery works? You tell your 
                         father he can get that for a song. 
                         And all the labor he wants, too. 
                         Half the town was thrown out of work 
                         when they closed down.

                         That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, 
                         that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew 
                         you'd come through. Now, here's the 
                         point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this 
                         too. Now listen.  Have you got any 
                         money?

                                     GEORGE
                         Money? Yeah... well, a little.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Well, now listen. I want you to put 
                         every cent you've got into our stock, 
                         you hear?  And George, I may have a 
                         job for you; that is, unless you're 
                         still married to that broken-down 
                         Building and Loan. This is the biggest 
                         thing since radio, and I'm letting 
                         you in on the ground floor. Oh, 
                         Mary...  Mary...

                                     MARY
                              (nervously)
                         I'm here.

                                     SAM'S VOICE
                         Would you tell that guy I'm giving 
                         him the chance of a lifetime, you 
                         hear? The chance of a lifetime.

               As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost 
               on his lips.

                                     MARY
                              (whispering)
                         He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

               George can stand it no longer. He drops the phone with a 
               crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her. Mary begins

                              (fiercely)
                         Now you listen to me! I don't want 
                         any plastics! I don't want any ground 
                         floors, and I don't want to get 
                         married  ever  to anyone! You 
                         understand that? I want to do what I 
                         want to do. And you're... and 
                         you're...

               He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each 
               other find themselves in tearful ecstasy.

               Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs. She practically faints

                         Here they come!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we hear the SOUND of the Wedding March.  
               People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors.  
               There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at 
               the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, 
               red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is 
               caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we 
               see that it is raining.  Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has 
               his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the 
               group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower 
               of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from 
               the curb.

                         cab.

               Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne 
               done up in gift wrappings.

                         That does it  come here.

               The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people 
               around the door. He stops the cab.

               LONG SHOT

               Scurrying people under umbrellas, swarming around the bank 
               doors.  Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close 
               down. Several people come running past the cab.

                         George, let's not stop. Let's go!

               George gets out of the cab and looks down the street.

                                     GEORGE
                         Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh...

                         I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

               George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan.

               EXT. BUILDING AND LOAN  DAY

               CLOSE SHOT  SIDEWALK

               An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and 
               Loan.  It has been locked. A crowd of men and women are 
               waiting around the grill. They are simply-dressed people, to 
               whom their savings are a matter of life and death.  George 
               comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at 
               him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their 
               rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how 
                         are you? Charlie? What's the matter 
                         here, can't you get in?

               No one answers. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes 
               it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and 
               into the outer offices of the Building and Loan.

               George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle 
               Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking 
               a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

               He points to George's office. George turns back cheerfully 
               to the crowd.

                                     GEORGE
                         Come on in, everybody. That's right, 
                         just come in.

               George vaults over the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now look, why don't you all sit down.  
                         There are a lot of seats over there. 
                         Just make yourselves at home.

                         George, can I see you a minute?

               The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the 
               teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George 
               hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for 
               him.

               anxious look.

               He realizes George has hung up, and clicks the phone

                         George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, 
                         I wanted to be there.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah...

                         ...you can take this one off now.

               An ominous SOUND of angry voices comes from the other room. 
               George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               More people have crowded around the counter. Their muttering 
               stops and they stand silent and grim. There is panic in their 
               faces.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, just remember that this thing 
                         isn't as black as it appears.

               As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street 
               below.  The crowd turn to the windows, then back to George.

                                     GEORGE
                         I have some news for you, folks. 
                         I've just talked to old man Potter, 
                         and he's guaranteed cash payments at 
                         the bank. The bank's going to reopen 
                         next week.

                         But, George, I got my money here.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did he guarantee this place?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask 
                         him.  We don't need Potter over here.

               Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene. 
               Mary stands watching silently.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll take mine now.

                                     GEORGE
                         No, but you... you... you're thinking 
                         of this place all wrong. As if I had 
                         the money back in a safe. The money's 
                         not here. Your money's in Joe's 
                         house...
                              (to one of the men)
                         ...right next to yours. And in the 
                         Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's 
                         house, and a hundred others. Why, 
                         you're lending them the money to 
                         build, and then, they're going to 
                         pay it back to you as best they can. 
                         Now what are you going to do?  
                         Foreclose on them?

                         I got two hundred and forty-two 
                         dollars in here, and two hundred and 
                         forty-two dollars isn't going to 
                         break anybody.

                              (handing him a slip)
                         Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. 
                         You sign this. You'll get your money 
                         in sixty days.

                                     TOM
                         Sixty days?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, now that's what you agreed to 
                         when you bought your shares.

               There is a commotion at the outer doors. A man (Randall) 
               comes in and makes his way up to Tom.

                                     RANDALL
                         Tom... Tom, did you get your money?

                                     TOM
                         No.

                                     RANDALL
                         Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay 
                         fifty cents on the dollar for every 
                         share you got.

                         Fifty cents on the dollar!

                                     RANDALL
                         Yes, cash!

                                     TOM
                              (to George)
                         Well, what do you say?

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, Tom, you have to stick to your 
                         original agreement. Now give us sixty 
                         days on this.

                                     TOM
                              (turning to Randall)
                         Okay, Randall.

               He starts out.

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         Are you going to go to Potter's?

                                     TOM
                         Better to get half than nothing.

               A few other people start for the door.  CAMERA PANS WITH 
               George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to 
               the people.

                                     GEORGE
                         Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now 
                         listen... now listen to me. I beg of 
                         you not to do this thing. If Potter 
                         gets hold of this Building and Loan 
                         there'll never be another decent 
                         house built in this town. He's already 
                         got charge of the bank.  He's got 
                         the bus line. He's got the department 
                         stores. And now he's after us.  Why? 
                         Well, it's very simple. Because we're 
                         cutting in on his business, that's 
                         why.  And because he wants to keep 
                         you living in his slums and paying 
                         the kind of rent he decides.

               The people are still trying to get out, but some of them 
               have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make 
               an impression on them.

                                     GEORGE
                         Joe, you lived in one of his houses, 
                         didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? 
                         Have you forgotten what he charged 
                         you for that broken-down shack?
                              (to Ed)
                         Here, Ed. You know, you remember 
                         last year when things weren't going 
                         so well, and you couldn't make your 
                         payments. You didn't lose your house, 
                         did you? Do you think Potter would 
                         have let you keep it?
                              (turns to address the 
                              room again)
                         Can't you understand what's happening 
                         here? Don't you see what's happening?  
                         Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!  
                         And why? Because we're panicky and 
                         he's not.  That's why. He's picking 
                         up some bargains.  Now, we can get 
                         through this thing all right. We've 
                         got to stick together, though. We've 
                         got to have faith in each other.

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         But my husband hasn't worked in over 
                         a year, and I need money.

                                     WOMAN
                         How am I going to live until the 
                         bank opens?

                                     MAN
                         I got doctor bills to pay.

                                     MAN
                         I need cash.

                                     MAN
                         Can't feed my kids on faith.

               During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. 
               Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the 
               door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out

                                     MARY
                         How much do you need?

               George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey! I got two thousand dollars! 
                         Here's two thousand dollars. This'll 
                         tide us over until the bank reopen.
                              (to Tom)
                         All right, Tom, how much do you need?

                                     TOM
                              (doggedly)
                         Two hundred and forty-two dollars!

                                     GEORGE
                              (pleading)
                         Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you 
                         over till the bank reopens.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take two hundred and forty-two 
                         dollars.

               George starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his 
               passbook on the counter.

                                     GEORGE
                         There you are.

                                     TOM
                         That'll close my account.

                                     GEORGE
                         Your account's still here. That's a 
                         loan.

               Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie.  
               George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, 
               and speaks to Ed, the next in line.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay. All right, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I got three hundred dollars here, 
                         George.

               Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash 
               he's got.

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till 
                         the bank reopens? What do you need?

                                     ED
                         Well, I suppose twenty dollars.

                                     GEORGE
                         Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. 
                         Fine.  Thanks, Ed.
                              (to Mrs. Thompson, 
                              next in line)
                         All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How 
                         much do you want?

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         But it's your own money, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Never mind about that. How much do 
                         you want?

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         I can get along with twenty, all 
                         right.

                                     GEORGE
                              (counting it out)
                         Twenty dollars.

                                     MRS. THOMPSON
                         And I'll sign a paper.

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't have to sign anything. I 
                         know you'll pay it back when you 
                         can. That's okay.

               George, Uncle Billy and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, 
               watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George 
               counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the 
               door.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (excitedly)
                         We're going to make it, George. 
                         They'll never close us up today!

               Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door, and scurries around 
               the counter to join the others.

                                     GEORGE

               Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle.

                                     GEORGE

                         I wish they were too. Okay, let's 
                         put them in the safe and see what 
                         happens.

               The four of them parade through the office; George puts the 
               two dollars in the safe.

                              for her)
                         Poor Mary. Look, I've got a train to 
                         catch.

                         Well, the train's gone. I wonder if 
                         Ernie's still here with his taxicab?

               George rushes into his office to look out the window.

                                     COUSIN TILLY
                              (on telephone)

                         Look, will you get my wife on the

               An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by 
               the weather. It once had class but has not been lived in for 
               years.  This is the house that George and Mary will live in 
               from now on.  The rain is pouring down. A faint glow of light 
               shines out from bottom windows. George hurries into scene. 
               He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up 
               the steps.

               George is approaching the front door of the house, on which 
               a sign is hanging: "Bridal Suite." Ernie looks out through 
               the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door.

                         Hiya... Good evening, sir.

               Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler. 
               This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting 
               on an old coachman's hat. George enters.

               INT. GRANVILLE HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS

               The house is carpetless, empty  the rain and wind cause 
               funny noises upstairs. A huge fire is burning in the 
               fireplace. Near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes 
               are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered 
               with a checkered oil cloth. It is set for two. A bucket with 
               ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a 
               bowl of caviar. Two small chickens are impaled on a spit 
               over the fire. A phonograph is playing on a box, and a string 
               from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit. The 
               phonograph is playing "Song of the Islands." Mary is standing 
               near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked. 
               She is smiling at George, who has been slowly taking in the 
               whole set-up. Through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed, 
               over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie. 
               Ernie exits and closes the door.

                                     MARY
                              (tears in her eyes)

                         Well, I'll be... Mary, Mary, where 
                         did you...

               They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in

                         what I wished for.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street 
               are two vehicles. One of them is George Bailey's rickety 
               car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high 
               with household goods. The Martini family is moving. The family 
               consists of Martini, his wife and four kid of various ages, 
               from two to ten.  George and Mary are helping the Martinis 
               move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Martini and 
               George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are 
               carrying out the last of the furniture.  As they emerge from 
               the house, one of the neighbors, Schultz, calls out:

                                     SCHULTZ
                         Martini, you rented a new house?

                              (to George)
                         You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?

                                     GEORGE
                         What's that?

                                     MARTINI
                         I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. 
                         I own my own house. No more we live 
                         like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. 
                         Hurry, Maria.

                              (to Mary)
                         Bring the baby.

                         I'll bring the kids in the car.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

               Mary gets in the front seat of the car, with the baby in her 
               arms.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, kids  here  get in here. 
                         Now get right up on the seat there.  
                         Get the...  get the goat!

               The family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids.

                                     MARTINI
                         Goodbye, everybody!

               The rickety caravan starts off down the street, to the cheers 
               of the neighbors.

               PANS TO follow George's car and the old truck laden with 
               furniture as they pass  we hear Martini's voice singing "O 
               Sole Mio." Bailey Park is a district of new small houses, 
               not all alike, but each individual. New lawns here and there, 
               and young trees. It has the promise when built up of being a 
               pleasant little middle class section.

               Potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk, with his goon 
               beside him.  His rent collector, Reineman, is talking, 
               pointing to maps spread out on the desk.

                                     REINEMAN
                         Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off 
                         my nose. I'm just your little rent 
                         collector.  But you can't laugh off 
                         this Bailey Park any more. Look at 
                         it.

               A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his 
               desk.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                         Congressman Blatz is here to see

                         Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses 
                         stuck here and there.
                              (indicating map)
                         There's the old cemetery, squirrels, 
                         buttercups, daisies. Used to hunt 
                         rabbits there myself. Look at it 
                         today. Dozens of the prettiest little 
                         homes you ever saw.  Ninety per cent 
                         owned by suckers who used to pay 
                         rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my 
                         dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just 
                         that. And are the local yokels making 
                         with those David and Goliath 
                         wisecracks!

                         Oh, they are, are they? Even though 
                         they know the Baileys haven't made a 
                         dime out of it.

                                     REINEMAN
                         You know very well why. The Baileys 
                         were all chumps. Every one of these 
                         homes is worth twice what it cost 
                         the Building and Loan to build. If I 
                         were you, Mr. Potter...

                                     POTTER
                              (interrupting)
                         Well, you are not me.

                                     REINEMAN
                              (as he leaves)
                         As I say, it's no skin off my nose. 
                         But one of these days this bright 
                         young man is going to be asking George 
                         Bailey for a job.

               Reineman exits.

                                     POTTER
                         The Bailey family has been a boil on 
                         my neck long enough.

               He flips the switch on the dictaphone.

               George and Mary are talking to Sam Wainwright in front of 
               the latter's car. Hs wife, Jane, is now out of the car.

                                     SAM
                         We just stopped in town to take a 
                         look at the new factory, and then 
                         we're going to drive on down to 
                         Florida.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

                                     JANE
                         Why don't you have your friends join 
                         us?

                                     SAM
                         Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids 
                         drive down with us, huh?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, 
                         Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Still got the nose to the old 
                         grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to 
                         let George in on the ground floor in 
                         plastics, and he turned me down cold.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, now, don't rub it in.

                                     SAM
                         I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess 
                         we better run along.

               There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into 
               their car.

                                     JANE
                         Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Nice meeting you.

                         So long, George. See you in the funny 
                         papers.

                         Have fun.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thanks for dropping around.

               The big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing 
               with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They 
               slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.

               Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George. 
               The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.

                                     GEORGE
                         Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. 
                         Potter.

                                     POTTER
                         You like it? I'll send you a box.

                                     GEORGE
                              (nervously)
                         Well, I... I suppose I'll find out 
                         sooner or later, but just what exactly 
                         did you want to see me about?

                                     POTTER
                              (laughs)
                         George, now that's just what I like 
                         so much about you.
                              (pleasantly and 
                              smoothly)
                         George, I'm an old man, and most 
                         people hate me. But I don't like 
                         them either, so that makes it all 
                         even. You know just as well as I do 
                         that I run practically everything in 
                         this town but the Bailey Building 
                         and Loan. You know, also, that for a 
                         number of years I've been trying to 
                         get control of it... or kill it. But 
                         I haven't been able to do it. You 
                         have been stopping me. In fact, you 
                         have beaten me, George, and as anyone 
                         in this county can tell you, that 
                         takes some doing. Take during the 
                         depression, for instance. You and I 
                         were the only ones that kept our 
                         heads. You saved the Building and 
                         Loan, and I saved all the rest.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes. Well, most people say you stole 
                         all the rest.

                         The envious ones say that, George, 
                         the suckers. Now, I have stated my 
                         side very frankly. Now, let's look 
                         at your side.  Young man, twenty-
                         seven, twenty-eight...  married, 
                         making, say... forty a week.

                                     GEORGE
                              (indignantly)
                         Forty-five!

                                     POTTER
                         Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, 
                         after supporting your mother, and 
                         paying your bills, you're able to 
                         keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child 
                         or two comes along, and you won't 
                         even be able to save the ten. Now, 
                         if this young man of twenty-eight 
                         was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd 
                         say he was doing fine. But George 
                         Bailey is not a common, ordinary 
                         yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, 
                         ambitious young man  who hates his 
                         job  who hates the Building and 
                         Loan almost as much as I do. A young 
                         man who's been dying to get out on 
                         his own ever since he was born. A 
                         young man... the smartest one of the 
                         crowd, mind you, a young man who has 
                         to sit by and watch his friends go 
                         places, because he's trapped.  Yes, 
                         sir, trapped into frittering his 
                         life away playing nursemaid to a lot 
                         of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a 
                         correct picture, or do I exaggerate?

                                     GEORGE
                              (mystified)
                         Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?

                                     POTTER
                         My point? My point is, I want to 
                         hire you.

                                     GEORGE
                              (dumbfounded)
                         Hire me?

                                     POTTER
                         I want you to manage my affairs, run 
                         my properties. George, I'll start 
                         you out at twenty thousand dollars a 
                         year.

               George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off 
               the sparks from his clothes.

                                     GEORGE
                              (flabbergasted)
                         Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars 
                         a year?

                                     POTTER
                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest 
                         house in town, buying your wife a 
                         lot of fine clothes, a couple of 
                         business trips to New York a year, 
                         maybe once in a while Europe. You 
                         wouldn't mind that, would you, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Would I?
                              (looking around 
                              skeptically)
                         You're not talking to somebody else 
                         around here, are you? You know, this 
                         is me, you remember me? George Bailey.

                                     POTTER
                         Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship 
                         has just come in  providing he has 
                         brains enough to climb aboard.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, what about the Building and 
                         Loan?

                                     POTTER
                         Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid 
                         of success? I'm offering you a three 
                         year contract at twenty thousand 
                         dollars a year, starting today. Is 
                         it a deal or isn't it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I 
                         ought to jump at the chance, but 
                         I... I just...  I wonder if it would 
                         be possible for you to give me twenty-
                         four hours to think it over?

                                     POTTER
                         Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and 
                         talk about it to your wife.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'd like to do that.

                                     POTTER
                         In the meantime, I'll draw up the 
                         papers.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, sir.

                                     POTTER
                              (offers hand)
                         Okay, George?

                                     GEORGE
                              (taking his hand)
                         Okay, Mr. Potter.

               As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. 
               Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that 
               moment of physical contact he knows he could never be 
               associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a 
               shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.

                                     GEORGE
                              (vehemently)
                         No... no... no... no, now wait a 
                         minute, here!  I don't have to talk 
                         to anybody!  I know right now, and 
                         the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it!
                              (getting madder all 
                              the time)
                         You sit around here and you spin 
                         your little webs and you think the 
                         whole world revolves around you and 
                         your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. 
                         Potter!  In the... in the whole vast 
                         configuration of things, I'd say you 
                         were nothing but a scurvy little 
                         spider. You...

               He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside 
               Potter's wheelchair.

                                     GEORGE
                         ...And that goes for you too!

               As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr. 
               Potter's secretary in the outer office

                                     GEORGE
                         And it goes for you too!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. BEDROOM  GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS THE BEDROOM

               The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair 
               or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George 
               comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, 
               relating to incidents in his past life.

                                     POTTER'S VOICE
                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest 
                         house in town. Buying your wife a 
                         lot of fine clothes, going to New 
                         York on a business trip a couple of 
                         times a year.  Maybe to Europe once 
                         in a while.

               George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser 
               and stares at his reflection in the mirror.

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         I know what I'm going to do tomorrow 
                         and the next day and next year and 
                         the year after that. I'm shaking the 
                         dust of this crummy little town off 
                         my feet, and I'm going to see the 
                         world... And I'm going to build 
                         things. I'm going to build air fields.  
                         I'm going to build skyscrapers a 
                         hundred stories high. I'm going to 
                         build a bridge a mile long.

               While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, 
               his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the 
               dresser:

               INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL

               It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first 
               saw in Mary's living room. The lettering reads: "George Lassos 
               The Moon."

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         What is it you want, Mary? You want 
                         the moon? If you do, just say the 
                         word; I'll throw a lasso around it 
                         and pull it down for you.

               Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:

                                     MARY
                              (singing)
                         Buffalo Gals, won't you come out 
                         tonight, won't you come out tonight, 
                         won't you come out tonight.

               George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hi.

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary Hatch, why in the world did you 
                         ever marry a guy like me?

                                     MARY
                         To keep from being an old maid.

                                     GEORGE
                         You could have married Sam Wainwright 
                         or anybody else in town.

                                     MARY
                         I didn't want to marry anybody else 
                         in town. I want my baby to look like 
                         you.

                                     GEORGE
                         You didn't even have a honeymoon. I 
                         promised you...
                              (does a double take)
                         ...Your what?

                                     MARY
                         My baby.

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulously)
                         You mean... Mary, you on the nest?

                                     MARY
                         George Bailey lassos stork.

                                     GEORGE
                         Lassos the stork! You mean you... 
                         What is it, a boy or a girl?

               Mary nods her head happily.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               MONTAGE SEQUENCE

               Over the following SERIES OF SHOTS we hear the voices of 
               Joseph and Clarence in Heaven.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George is crossing the street, heading for the offices of 
               the Building and Loan.

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Now, you've probably already guessed 
                         that George never leaves Bedford 
                         Falls.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         No!

                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
                         Then she had another one  a girl.

               BOY WINS CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR". The subhead tells of 
               a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a 
               banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N. on his 
               way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional 
               Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman 
               pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of 
               dignitaries; a picture of the transport which Harry saved. 
               Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story.

                         What man?

                         I'll be right back.

               He gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath and goes 
               over to Carter.

               Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks.

                              (writing)
                         December twenty-fourth...

               He takes a thick envelope from his inside pocket and thumbs 
               through the bills it contains. It is evidently a large sum 
               of money.

               MEDIUM SHOT  DOOR TO STREET

               Potter is being wheeled in by his goon. Various bank officials 
               run over to greet him  he is reading a newspaper. Uncle 
               Billy has finished filling out his slip, and comes over to 
               taunt Potter, the envelope containing the money in his hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's 
                         the news?

               He grabs the paper from Potter's hand.

                                     UNCLE BILLY(CONT'D)
                         Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins 
                         Congressional Medal. That couldn't 
                         be one of the Bailey boys? You just 
                         can't keep those Baileys down, now, 
                         can you, Mr. Potter?

                                     POTTER
                         How does slacker George feel about 
                         that?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Very jealous, very jealous. He only 
                         lost three buttons off his vest. Of 
                         course, slacker George would have 
                         gotten two of those medals if he had 
                         gone.

                                     POTTER
                         Bad ear.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Yes.

               Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing 
               his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         After all, Potter, some people like 
                         George had to stay home. Not every 
                         heel was in Germany and Japan!

               In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward 
               his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward 
               deposit window with his deposit slip.

                         Good morning, Horace.

               Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, 
               starts to punch it with rubber stamps.

                                     TELLER
                         I guess you forgot something.

                         Well, aren't you going to make a

                         Well, then... it's usually customary 
                         to bring the money with you.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Oh, shucks...

               Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has.

               The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of 
               the numerous string tied around his fingers.

                                     TELLER
                         How about that one there?

               in front of him, muttering as he does so.

               He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money. Then, to 
               his goon, indicating the office door:

                         Take me back there. Hurry up.

                         Come on, look sharp.

               Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into 
               the bank.

               Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope. It is not 
               there.  He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern 
               creeps into his eyes. He starts thumping his pockets, with 
               increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the 
               floor. He finally rushes through the door and out into the 
               street.

               The goon wheels him back to his desk. He is deep in thought,

                         furs, and that hat? Want to walk to

                         meals and rent up there just the

               She looks at him, then says a strange thing.

                         I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

               She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick.  
               George opens the door for her.

               As George and Violet come through the door, they are being 
               watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace and the bank examiner, 
               who is still waiting to go to work on the books.

                                     GEORGE
                         Say hello to New York for me.

                         Now, let's hear from you...

               Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it 
               with her handkerchief.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter? Merry Christmas,

               As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically 
               looking for the missing envelope. The office is in a mess, 
               drawers are opened, and papers scattered on the floor and on 
               the desk.

                                     GEORGE
                         Unc... What's going on? The bank 
                         examiner's here, and I...

                         Yeah, yeah. He wants the accounts 
                         payable...

               George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes 
               looking up at him.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter with you?

               Uncle Billy gestures nervously for George to come in. He 
               does so and closes the door.

               Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, and Cousin Eustace 
               standing beside her. Carter is still waiting in the doorway 
               to his office.  Suddenly the door opens and George comes 
               striding out. He goes directly to the safe and starts 
               searching, but doesn't find the money. Then he goes to the 
               cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it.

                                     GEORGE

                         Come here a minute.

               Cousin Eustace runs over to George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Did you see Uncle Billy with any

                         He had it on his desk counting it 
                         before he closed up.

               Uncle Billy and George are retracing the former's steps

               They pause for a moment on the sidewalk.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now look, did you buy anything?

                         Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

               CLOSE SHOT

               A shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room which has been turned 
               almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the 
               missing money. Drawers of an old secretary have been pulled 
               out and are on the floor. Every conceivable place which might 
               have been used by Uncle Billy to put the money has been 
               searched. George, his hair rumpled, is feverishly pursuing 
               the search. Uncle Billy is seated behind the desk, his head 
               on his hands.

                                     GEORGE
                         And did you put the envelope in your 
                         pocket?

                         Maybe  maybe! I don't want any maybe.  
                         Uncle Billy, we've got to find that 
                         money!

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (piteously)
                         I'm no good to you, George. I...

                                     GEORGE
                         Listen to me. Do you have any secret 
                         hiding place here in the house? 
                         Someplace you could have put it? 
                         Someplace to hide the money?

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (exhausted)
                         I've been over the whole house, even 
                         in rooms that have been locked ever 
                         since I lost Laura.

               Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. George grabs him by 
               the lapels and shakes him.

                                     GEORGE
                              (harshly)
                         Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! 
                         Think!

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (sobbing)
                         I can't think any more, George. I 
                         can't think any more. It hurts...

               George jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy 
               stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets 
               hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost 
               maniacal.

                                     GEORGE
                              (screaming at him)
                         Where's that money, you stupid, silly 
                         old fool? Where's the money?  Do you 
                         realize what this means? It means 
                         bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!

               He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts 
               at him:

                                     GEORGE
                         That's what it means! One of us is 
                         going to jail! Well, it's not going 
                         to be me!

               George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a 
               waste basket on the floor as he goes. Uncle Billy remains 
               sobbing at the table, his head in his arms.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

                         No. I left it at the office.

                         Is it snowing?

               During this scene, George has been sitting in the chair, 
               hugging Tommy to him, and crying quietly. Mary realizes that 
               something is seriously wrong, and breaks off. Janie is 
               thumping away at the piano.

                                     GEORGE
                         Must she keep playing that?

                                     JANIE
                              (hurt)
                         I have to practice for the party 
                         tonight, Daddy.

                                     PETE
                         Mommy says we can stay up till 
                         midnight and sing Christmas carols.

                                     TOMMY
                         Can you sing, Daddy?

                                     MARY
                              (to George)
                         Better hurry and shave. The families 
                         will be here soon.

                                     GEORGE
                              (rising from chair)
                         Families!  I don't want the families 
                         over here!

               Mary leads him out toward the kitchen.

                                     MARY
                         Come on out in the kitchen with me 
                         while I finish dinner.

               They exit with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails, and 
               pulling at him. CAMERA PANS WITH them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Excuse me... excuse me...

               As they go toward kitchen.

                                     MARY
                         Have a hectic day?

                                     GEORGE
                              (bitterly)
                         Oh, yeah, another big red letter day 
                         for the Baileys.

                                     PETE
                         Daddy, the Browns next door have a 
                         new car. You should see it.

                                     GEORGE
                              (turns on him)
                         Well, what's the matter with our 
                         car?  Isn't it good enough for you?

                                     PETE
                         Yes, Daddy.

                                     TOMMY
                              (tugging at coat)

               CLOSE SHOT

               They come through the door.

                                     GEORGE
                              (annoyed)
                         Excuse you for what?

                                     TOMMY
                         I burped!

                                     MARY
                         All right, darling, you're excused. 
                         Now go upstairs and see what little 
                         Zuzu wants.

               Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove.

                                     GEORGE
                         Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?

                                     MARY
                         Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. 
                         Caught it coming home from school.  
                         They gave her a flower for a prize 
                         and she didn't want to crush it so 
                         she didn't button up her coat.

                                     GEORGE
                         What is it, a sore throat or what?

                                     MARY
                         Just a cold. The doctor says it's 
                         nothing serious.

                                     GEORGE
                         The doctor? Was the doctor here?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, I called him right away. He 
                         says it's nothing to worry about.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is she running a temperature? What 
                         is it?

                                     MARY
                         Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, 
                         six.  She'll be all right.

               George paces about the kitchen, worried.

                                     GEORGE
                         Gosh, it's this old house. I don't 
                         know why we don't all have pneumonia. 
                         This drafty old barn! Might as well 
                         be living in a refrigerator. Why did 
                         we have to live here in the first 
                         place and stay around this measly, 
                         crummy old town?

                                     MARY
                              (worried)
                         George, what's wrong?

                                     GEORGE
                         Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call 
                         this a happy family? Why did we have 
                         to have all these kids?

                                     PETE
                              (coming in)
                         Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouts)
                         I don't know. Ask your mother.

               George goes toward doorway.

                                     MARY
                         Where're you going?

                                     GEORGE
                         Going up to see Zuzu.

               We hear his footsteps as he leaves. Mary looks after him, 
               puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete.

                                     PETE
                         He told me to write a play for 
                         tonight.

                                     MARY
                         F-R-A-N-K-I-N...

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE STARTS UP THE STAIRS

               The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a 
               moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. 
               Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs.

               INT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same 
               monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting 
               up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding 
               her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's 
               awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.

                                     ZUZU
                         Hi, Daddy.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, what happened to you?

                                     ZUZU
                         I won a flower.

               She starts to get out of bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Wait now. Where do you think you're 
                         going?

                                     ZUZU
                         Want to give my flower a drink.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right, all right. Here, give 
                         Daddy the flower. I'll give it a 
                         drink.

               She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few 
               petals fall off. She picks them up.

                                     ZUZU
                         Look, Daddy... paste it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste 
                         this together.

               She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his 
               back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He 
               sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the 
               flower, and then turns back to Zuzu.

                                     GEORGE
                         There it is, good as new.

                                     ZUZU
                         Give the flower a drink.

               George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside 
               her bed.

                                     GEORGE
                         Now, will you do something for me?

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ZUZU

               They whisper.

                                     ZUZU
                         What?

                                     GEORGE
                         Will you try to get some sleep?

                                     ZUZU
                         I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my 
                         flower.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know  I know, but you just go to 
                         sleep, and then you can dream about 
                         it, and it'll be a whole garden.

                                     ZUZU
                         It will?

                                     GEORGE
                         Uh-huh.

               She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the 
               covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril 
               of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the 
               room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano. 
               Pete is seated at the table writing. Tommy is playing with 
               his toy vacuum cleaner. The telephone rings.

                                     JANIE AND PETE
                         Telephone.

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary comes in and picks up the phone.

                                     MARY
                         I'll get it.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

               George enters shot, and stands listening to her.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure 
                         she'll be all right. The doctor says 
                         that she ought to be out of bed in 
                         time to have her Christmas dinner.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is that Zuzu's teacher?

                                     MARY
                              (hand over receiver)
                         Yes.

                                     GEORGE
                         Let me speak to her.

               He snatches the phone from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                              (on phone)
                         Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?  This is 
                         George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. 
                         Say, what kind of a teacher are you 
                         anyway?  What do you mean sending 
                         her home like that, halfnaked?  Do 
                         you realize she'll probably end up 
                         with pneumonia on account of you?

                                     MARY
                              (shocked)
                         George!

               She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. 
               She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is 
               really a tirade against the world, against life itself, 
               against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice 
               sputtering with protest.

                                     GEORGE
                         Is this the sort of thing we pay 
                         taxes for  to have teachers like 
                         you? Silly, stupid, careless people 
                         who send our kids home without any 
                         clothes on? You know, maybe my kids 
                         aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe 
                         they don't have any decent clothes...

               Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, that stupid...

               Mary speaks quickly in to the phone.

                                     MARY
                         Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to 
                         apologize...  hello... hello...
                              (to George)
                         She's hung up.

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         I'll hang her up!

               But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male 
               voice calling:

                                     MR. WELCH'S VOICE
                         Now, who do you think you are?

               George hears this and grabs the receiver from Mary.

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Mary)
                         Wait a minute.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch?  
                         Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives 
                         me a chance to tell you what I really 
                         think of your wife.

               Mary once more tries to take the phone from him.

                                     MARY
                         George...

                                     GEORGE
                              (raving at her)
                         Will you get out and let me handle 
                         this?
                              (into phone  shouting)
                         Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, 
                         huh?  Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you 
                         think you're man enough... Hello? 
                         Any...

               But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear 
               a click on the phone.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh...

               He hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room. 
               His face is flushed and wet.

                                     PETE
                         Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouts)
                         How should I know? What do you think 
                         I am, a dictionary?

               He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner.

                                     GEORGE
                         Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

               Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously.

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         Janie, haven't you learned that silly 
                         tune yet? You've played it over and 
                         over again.  Now stop it! Stop it!

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND 
               being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner 
               of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, 
               several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely 
               he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them 
               into the corner.  Mary and the children watch, horrified. 
               George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he 
               were some unknown wild animal.  The three children are crying.

                                     GEORGE
                              (gasping for breath)
                         I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I 
                         didn't mean... you go on and practice.  
                         Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm 
                         sorry. What do you want to know?

                                     PETE
                              (holding back his 
                              tears)
                         Nothing, Daddy.

               Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious 
               outburst. There is silence in the room.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter with everybody? 
                         Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
                              (shouts)
                         Now, go on, play!

               Janie breaks into sobs.

                                     JANIE
                         Oh, Daddy...

                                     MARY
                              (in an outburst)
                         George, why must you torture the 
                         children?  Why don't you...

               The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for 
               George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary...

               He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of 
               the house. Mary goes to the phone, picks it up.

                                     MARY
                         Bedford, two-four-seven, please.

                                     PETE
                         Is Daddy in trouble?

                                     JANIE
                         Shall I pray for him?

                                     MARY
                         Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

                                     TOMMY
                         Me, too?

                                     MARY
                         You too, Tommy.
                              (on phone)
                         Hello, Uncle Billy?

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. POTTER'S OFFICE IN BANK  NIGHT  8:00 P.M.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is 
               signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the 
               desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need 
                         help.  Through some sort of an 
                         accident my company's short in their 
                         accounts. The bank examiner's up 
                         there today. I've got to raise eight 
                         thousand dollars immediately.

                                     POTTER
                              (casually)
                         Oh, so that's what the reporters 
                         wanted to talk to you about?

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulous)
                         The reporters?

                                     POTTER
                         Yes. They called me up from your 
                         Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man 
                         over there from the D.A.'s office, 
                         too. He's looking for you.

                                     GEORGE
                              (desperate)
                         Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, 
                         won't you please? Can't you see what 
                         it means to my family? I'll pay you 
                         any sort of a bonus on the loan... 
                         any interest. If you still want the 
                         Building and Loan, why I...

                                     POTTER
                              (interrupting)
                         George, could it possibly be there's 
                         a slight discrepancy in the books?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. There's nothing wrong with 
                         the books. I've just misplaced eight 
                         thousand dollars. I can't find it 
                         anywhere.

                                     POTTER
                              (looking up)
                         You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

                                     GEORGE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         Have you notified the police?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.  
                         Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

                                     POTTER
                              (snorts)
                         They're going to believe that one. 
                         What've you been doing, George? 
                         Playing the market with the company's 
                         money?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.

                                     POTTER
                         What is it  a woman, then? You know, 
                         it's all over town that you've been 
                         giving money to Violet Bick.

                                     GEORGE
                              (incredulous)
                         What?

                                     POTTER
                         Not that it makes any difference to 
                         me, but why did you come to me? Why 
                         don't you go to Sam Wainwright and 
                         ask him for the money?

                                     GEORGE
                         I can't get hold of him. He's in 
                         Europe.

                                     POTTER
                         Well, what about all your other 
                         friends?

                                     GEORGE
                         They don't have that kind of money, 
                         Mr. Potter. You know that. You're 
                         the only one in town that can help 
                         me.

                                     POTTER
                         I see. I've suddenly become quite 
                         important. What kind of security 
                         would I have, George? Have you got 
                         any stocks?

                                     GEORGE
                              (shaking his head)
                         No, sir.

                                     POTTER
                         Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of 
                         any kind?

                                     GEORGE
                              (pulls out policy)
                         I have some life insurance, a fifteen 
                         thousand dollar policy.

                                     POTTER
                         Yes... how much is your equity in 
                         it?

                                     GEORGE
                         Five hundred dollars.

                                     POTTER
                              (sarcastically)
                         Look at you. You used to be so cocky! 
                         You were going to go out and conquer 
                         the world! You once called me a 
                         warped, frustrated old man. What are 
                         you but a warped, frustrated young 
                         man? A miserable little clerk crawling 
                         in here on your hands and knees and 
                         begging for help. No securities  no 
                         stocks  no bonds  nothing but a 
                         miserable little five hundred dollar 
                         equity in a life insurance policy. 
                         You're worth more dead than alive.  
                         Why don't you go to the riff-raff 
                         you love so much and ask them to let 
                         you have eight thousand dollar? You 
                         know why? Because they'd run you out 
                         of town on a rail... But I'll tell 
                         you what I'm going to do for you, 
                         George. Since the state examiner is 
                         still here, as a stockholder of the 
                         Building and Loan, I'm going to swear 
                         out a warrant for your arrest.  
                         Misappropriation of funds  
                         manipulation  malfeasance...

               George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up 
               the phone and dials.

                                     POTTER
                         All right, George, go ahead. You 
                         can't hide in a little town like 
                         this.

               George is out of the door by now.  CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to 
               Potter.

                                     POTTER
                              (on phone)
                         Bill? This is Potter.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses 
               the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps 
               over the door, and drives off.

               EXT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name 
               "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall.

               INT. MARTINI'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles 
               sparkle.  There are Christmas greens and holly decorating 
               the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini 
               himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the 
               checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of 
               festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a 
               public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has 
               had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                              (greeting new customers)
                         Merry Christmas. Glad you came.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         How about some of that good spaghetti?

                                     MARTINI'S VOICE
                         We got everything.

               During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the 
               bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other 
               side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of 
               beer. George is mumbling:

                                     GEORGE
                         God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, 
                         I'm not a praying man, but if you're 
                         up there and you can hear me, show 
                         me the way. I'm at the end of my 
                         rope. Show me the way, God.

                                     NICK
                              (friendly)
                         Are you all right, George? Want 
                         someone to take you home?

               George shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side.

                                     MARTINI
                              (worried)
                         Why you drink so much, my friend? 
                         Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is 
                         Christmas Eve.

               The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts 
               sharply to the name "Bailey."

                                     MAN
                         Bailey? Which Bailey?

                                     NICK
                         This is Mr. George Bailey.

               Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at 
               George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several 
               others rush to pick him up.

                                     MAN
                              (to George)
                         And the next time you talk to my 
                         wife like that you'll get worse. She 
                         cried for an hour. It isn't enough 
                         she slaves teaching your stupid kids 
                         how to read and write, and you have 
                         to bawl her out...

                                     MARTINI
                              (furious)
                         You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

               Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money.

                                     WELCH
                         Now wait... I want to pay for my 
                         drink.

                                     MARTINI
                         Never mind the money. You get out of 
                         here quick.

                                     WELCH
                         All right.

                                     MARTINI
                         You hit my best friend. Get out!

               Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to 
               help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding.

                                     NICK
                         You all right, George?

                                     GEORGE
                              (stunned)
                         Who was that?

                                     MARTINI
                         He's gone. Don't worry. His name is 
                         Welch.  He don't come in to my place 
                         no more.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh  Welch. That's what I get for 
                         praying.

                                     MARTINI
                         The last time he come in here. You 
                         hear that, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         Yes, you bet.

                                     GEORGE
                         Where's my insurance policy?
                              (finds it in pocket)
                         Oh, here...

               He starts for the door.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, no, Please, don't go out this 
                         way, Mr. Bailey.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm all right.

               Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off.

                                     MARTINI
                         Oh, no  you don't feel so good.

                                     GEORGE
                         I'm all right.

                                     MARTINI
                         Please don't go away  please!

               George opens the door and exits to the street.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling 
               snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the 
               sidewalk of a house.  George gets out to look at the damage, 
               and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to 
               shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running 
               out.

                                     OWNER
                         What do you think you're doing?

               CLOSE SHOT

               George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. 
               The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George 
               stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, 
               looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages.

                                     OWNER
                              (with indignation)
                         Now look what you did. My 
                         greatgrandfather planted this tree.

               George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to 
               the man.

                                     OWNER
                         Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here, 
                         you drunken fool! Get this car out 
                         of here!

               EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck 
               swings around the corner and nearly hits him.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's the matter with you?  
                         Look where you're going!

               The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow 
               catwalk at the railing.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. 
               The snow is now falling hard.

               EXT. RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN from George's angle TO the water, dotted 
               with floating ice, passing under the bridge.

               EXT. BRIDGE AT RAILING  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE

               He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up 
               his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, 
               fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as 
               though about to jump.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water 
               with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified.

                                     VOICE
                              (from river)
                         Help! Help!

               George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing 
               into the water.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, 
               and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man.

                                     MAN
                         Help! Help! Help!

               EXT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes 
               running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines 
               on the two figures struggling in the water below.

               EXT. RIVER  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we 
               have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs 
               hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER

               George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which 
               his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter 
               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at 
               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the 
               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved 
               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the 
               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous 
               seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night 
               shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at 
               the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The 
               tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them 
               suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but 
               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or 
               says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing 
               the tollkeeper.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I didn't have time to get some stylish 
                         underwear. My wife gave me this on 
                         my last birthday. I passed away in 
                         it.

               The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of 
               it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's 
               attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is 
               hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. 
                         You should read the new book Mark 
                         Twain's writing now.

               The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         How'd you happen to fall in?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I didn't fall in. I jumped in to 
                         save George.

               George looks up, surprised.

                                     GEORGE
                         You what? To save me?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go 
                         through with it, did you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Go through with what?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Suicide.

               George and the tollkeeper react to this.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         It's against the law to commit suicide 
                         around here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Yeah, it's against the law where I 
                         come from, too.

                                     TOLLKEEPER
                         Where do you come from?

               He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next 
               statement.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Heaven.
                              (to George)
                         I had to act quickly; that's why I 
                         jumped in. I knew if I were drowning 
                         you'd try to save me. And you see, 
                         you did, and that's how I saved you.

               The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually 
               looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.

                                     GEORGE
                              (offhand)
                         Very funny.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your lip's bleeding, George.

               George's hand goes to his mouth.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in 
                         answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (comes around to George)
                         Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to 
                         your prayer. That's why I was sent 
                         down here.

                                     GEORGE
                              (casually interested)
                         How do you know my name?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, I know all about you. I've watched 
                         you grow up from a little boy.

                                     GEORGE
                         What are you, a mind reader or 
                         something?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, no.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, who are you, then?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

                                     GEORGE
                         Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Angel, Second Class.

               The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. 
               He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on 
               two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the 
               door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest 
               cop.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to tollkeeper)
                         Cheerio, my good man.

               George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini 
                         put in those drinks?

               He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, what's with you? What did you 
                         say just a minute ago? Why'd you 
                         want to save me?

                                     CLARENCE
                         That's what I was sent down for. I'm 
                         your guardian angel.

                                     GEORGE
                         I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Ridiculous of you to think of killing 
                         yourself for money. Eight thousand 
                         dollars.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Yeah... just things like that. Now 
                         how'd you know that?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I told you  I'm your guardian angel. 
                         I know everything about you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, you look about like the kind 
                         of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen 
                         angel, aren't you? What happened to 
                         your wings?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I haven't won my wings yet. That's 
                         why I'm an angel Second Class.

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know whether I like it very 
                         much being seen around with an angel 
                         without any wings.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll 
                         help me, won't you?

                                     GEORGE
                              (humoring him)
                         Sure, sure. How?

                                     CLARENCE
                         By letting me help you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Only one way you can help me. You 
                         don't happen to have eight thousand 
                         bucks on you?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, no, no. We don't use money in 
                         Heaven.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. 
                         Comes in pretty handy down here, 
                         bub.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, tut, tut, tut.

                                     GEORGE
                         I found it out a little late. I'm 
                         worth more dead than alive.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Now look, you mustn't talk like that. 
                         I won't get my wings with that 
                         attitude. You just don't know all 
                         that you've done. If it hadn't been 
                         for you...

                                     GEORGE
                              (interrupts)
                         Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, 
                         everybody'd be a lot better off. My 
                         wife, and my kids and my friends.
                              (annoyed with Clarence)
                         Look, little fellow, go off and haunt 
                         somebody else, will you?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No, you don't understand. I've got 
                         my job...

                                     GEORGE
                              (savagely)
                         Aw, shut up, will you.

               Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces 
               across the room, thoughtfully.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to himself)
                         Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy.
                              (to George)
                         So you still think killing yourself 
                         would make everyone feel happier, 
                         eh?

                                     GEORGE
                              (dejectedly)
                         Oh, I don't know. I guess you're 
                         right. I suppose it would have been 
                         better if I'd never been born at 
                         all.

                                     CLARENCE
                         What'd you say?

                                     GEORGE
                         I said I wish I'd never been born.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, you mustn't say things like that.  
                         You...
                              (gets an idea)
                         ...wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
                         That's an idea.
                              (glances up toward 
                              Heaven)
                         What do you think? Yeah, that'll do 
                         it.  All right.
                              (to George)
                         You've got your wish. You've never 
                         been born.

               As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside 
               the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the 
               door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (looking upward)
                         You don't have to make all that fuss 
                         about it.

               As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring 
               his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what 
               Clarence has said.

                                     GEORGE
                         What did you say?

                                     CLARENCE
                         You've never been born. You don't 
                         exist.  You haven't a care in the 
                         world.

               George feels his ear as Clarence talks.

                                     CLARENCE
                         No worries  no obligations  no 
                         eight thousand dollars to get  no 
                         Potter looking for you with the 
                         Sheriff.

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

               George indicates his bad ear.

                                     GEORGE
                         Say something else in that ear.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (bending down)
                         Sure. You can hear out of it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, that's the doggonedest thing... 
                         I haven't heard anything out of that 
                         ear since I was a kid. Must have 
                         been that jump in the cold water.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, 
                         George.

               George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut 
               he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you know about that... What's 
                         happened?

                                     MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
                         George looks around, as though to 
                         get his bearings.

                                     GEORGE
                         It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?  
                         What's happened here?
                              (standing up)
                         Come on, soon as these clothes of 
                         ours are dry...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Our clothes are dry.

               George feels the clothes on the line.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you know about that? Stove's 
                         hotter than I thought. Now, come on, 
                         get your clothes on, and we'll stroll 
                         up to my car and get...

               They start dressing. George interrupts himself.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.

                                     GEORGE
                         You haven't got your wings. Yeah, 
                         that's right.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               This is the same empty street where George's car swerved 
               into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come 
               into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car 
               smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car 
               is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.

                         What's the matter?

                                     GEORGE
                              (puzzled)
                         Well, this is where I left my car 
                         and it isn't here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You have no car.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, I had a car, and it was right 
                         here.  I guess somebody moved it.

               CLOSE SHOT  AT CURB

               The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages 
               under his arm.

                                     OWNER
                              (politely)
                         Good evening.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?

                                     OWNER
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     GEORGE
                         My car, my car. I'm the fellow that 
                         owns the car that ran into your tree.

                                     OWNER
                         What tree?

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, what tree? This 
                         tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a 
                         big gash in the side of it here.

               The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then 
               straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.

                                     OWNER
                         You must mean two other trees. You 
                         had me worried. One of the oldest 
                         trees in Pottersville.

                                     GEORGE
                              (blankly)
                         Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford 
                         Falls.

                                     OWNER
                         I mean Pottersville.
                              (sharply)
                         Don't you think I know where I live?  
                         What's the matter with you?

               The owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely 
               bewildered.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my 
                         nut, or he is...
                              (to Clarence)
                         ...or you are!

                                     CLARENCE
                         It isn't me!

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, maybe I left the car up at 
                         Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.

               He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the 
               road.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (as they go)
                         Clarence!

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful 
               Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking 
               joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People 
               are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the 
               bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the 
               difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up 
               to the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                              (as they come in)
                         That's all right. Go on in. Martini's 
                         a good friend of mine.

               Two people leave the bar as they approach.

                                     GEORGE
                         There's a place to sit down. Sit 
                         down.

                                     MEDIUM CLOSEUP
                         Nick is wiping off the bar as they 
                         sit down.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

                                     NICK
                         You want a martini?

                                     GEORGE
                         No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is 
                         he?

                                     NICK
                              (impatient)
                         Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink 
                         or don't you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay  all right. Double bourbon, 
                         quick, huh?

                                     NICK
                         Okay.
                              (to Clarence)
                         What's yours?

                                     CLARENCE
                         I was just thinking...
                              (face puckers up with 
                              delicious anticipation)
                         It's been so long since I...

                                     NICK
                              (impatient)
                         Look, mister, I'm standing here 
                         waiting for you to make up your mind.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (appreciatively)
                         That's a good man. I was just thinking 
                         of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not 
                         cold enough for that. Not nearly 
                         cold enough...  Wait a minute... 
                         wait a minute... I got it. Mulled 
                         wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light 
                         on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, 
                         and be lively!

                                     NICK
                         Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks 
                         in here for men who want to get drunk 
                         fast.  And we don't need any 
                         characters around to give the joint 
                         atmosphere. Is that clear?  Or do I 
                         have to slip you my left for a 
                         convincer?

               As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his 
               left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by 
               this conduct.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to George)
                         What's he talking about?

                                     GEORGE
                              (soothingly)
                         Nick  Nick, just give him the same 
                         as mine. He's okay.

                                     NICK
                         Okay.

               Nick turns away to get the drinks.

                                     GEORGE
                         What's the matter with him. I never 
                         saw Nick act like that before.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You'll see a lot of strange things 
                         from now on.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you 
                         worry me. You got someplace to sleep?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         You don't huh? Well, you got any 
                         money?

               Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.

                                     CLARENCE
                         No.

                                     GEORGE
                         No wonder you jumped in the river.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I jumped in the river to save you so 
                         I could get my wings.

               Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, that's right.

               A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the 
               SOUND of the bell.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Made what?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Every time you hear a bell ring, it 
                         means that some angel's just got his 
                         wings.

               George glances up at Nick.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, I think maybe you better not 
                         mention getting your wings around 
                         here.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Why? Don't they believe in angels?

                                     GEORGE
                              (looking at Nick)
                         A... Yeah, but... you know...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Then why should they be surprised 
                         when they see one?

                                     GEORGE
                              (to Nick)
                         He never grew up. He's...
                              (to Clarence)
                         How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Two hundred and ninety-three...
                              (thinks)
                         ...next May.

               Nick slams the bottle down on the counter.

                                     NICK
                         That does it! Out you two pixies go, 
                         through the door or out the window!

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, Nick. What's wrong?

                                     NICK
                              (angrily)
                         And that's another thing. Where do 
                         you come off calling me Nick?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't 
                         it?

                                     NICK
                         What's that got to do with it? I 
                         don't know you from Adam's off ox.
                              (sees someone come in)
                         Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come

               A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a 
               broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand.

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE

               He can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist.

               BACK TO SHOT  NICK AT THE BAR

                                     NICK
                              (to Gower)
                         Didn't I tell you never to come 
                         panhandling around here?

               Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the 
               face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly 
               as the soda runs off his face.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George 
                         Bailey! Don't you know me?

                                     GOWER
                         No. No.

                                     NICK
                              (to his bouncers)
                         Throw him out. Throw him out.

               The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes 
               back to the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... 
                         Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

                                     NICK
                         You know, that's another reason for 
                         me not to like you. That rumhead 
                         spent twenty years in jail for 
                         poisoning a kid. If you know him, 
                         you must be a jailbird yourself.
                              (to his bouncers)
                         Would you show these gentlemen to 
                         the door.

                                     BOUNCER
                         Sure. This way, gentlemen.

               EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in 
               the snow.

               INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.

                                     NICK
                         Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!

               EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, 
               puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they 
               landed, looking at each other.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You see, George, you were not there 
                         to stop Gower from putting that poison 
                         into the...

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, I wasn't there? I 
                         remember distinctly...

               George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with 
               the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" 
               instead of "MARTINI'S."

               George and Clarence get to their feet.

                                     GEORGE
                              (exasperated)
                         What the... hey, what's going on 
                         around here?  Why, this ought to be 
                         Martini's place.

               He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort 
               of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested 
               look.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look, who are you?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (patiently)
                         I told you, George. I'm your guardian 
                         angel.

               George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his 
               arm.  It's flesh.

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. 
                         What else are you? What... are you a 
                         hypnotist?

                                     CLARENCE
                         No, of course not.

                                     GEORGE
                         Well then, why am I seeing all these 
                         strange things?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Don't you understand, George? It's 
                         because you were not born.

                                     GEORGE
                         Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

                                     CLARENCE
                         You're nobody. You have no identity.

               George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but 
               without success.

                                     GEORGE
                         What do you mean, no identity? My 
                         name's George Bailey.

                                     CLARENCE
                         There is no George Bailey. You have 
                         no papers, no cards, no driver's 
                         license, no 4-F card, no insurance 
                         policy...
                              (he says these things 
                              as George searches 
                              for them)
                         George looks in his watch pocket.

                                     CLARENCE
                         They're not there, either.

                                     GEORGE
                         What?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Zuzu's petals.

               George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You've been given a great gift, 
                         George. A chance to see what the 
                         world would be like without you.

               George is completely befuddled.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shaking his head)
                         Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute 
                         here. As, this is some sort of a 
                         funny dream I'm having here. So long, 
                         mister, I'm going home.

               He starts off. Clarence rises.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Home? What home?

                                     GEORGE
                              (furious)
                         Now shut up! Cut it out! You're...  
                         you're... you're crazy! That's what 
                         I think... you're screwy, and you're 
                         driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing 
                         things. I'm going home and see my 
                         wife and family. Do you understand 
                         that? And I'm going home alone!

               George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, 
               glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.

                                     CLARENCE
                         How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks.
                              (pause)
                         No, I didn't have a drink!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE

               The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." 
               George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street 
               toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH 
               him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where 
               before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become 
               in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS 
               of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and 
               the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority 
               of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque 
               house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, 
               and so on.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George stops before what used to be the offices of the 
               Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the 
               entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people 
               are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and 
               dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw 
               into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey... hey. Where did the Building 
                         and Loan move to?

                                     COP
                         The Building and what?

                                     GEORGE
                         The Bailey Building and Loan. It was 
                         up there.

                                     COP
                         They went out of business years ago.

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP

               George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as 
               a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Violet!
                              (to the cop)
                         Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!

                                     COP
                         I know. I know.

                                     GEORGE
                         I know that girl!

               The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees 
               Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hey, Ernie  Ernie!

               EXT. STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.

                                     GEORGE
                         Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!

                                     ERNIE
                              (a much harder Ernie)
                         Where do you live?

                                     GEORGE
                         Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't 
                         you start pulling that stuff. You 
                         know where I live. Three-twenty 
                         Sycamore. Now hurry up.

                                     ERNIE
                         Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?...

                                     GEORGE
                         Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

                                     ERNIE
                         All right.  He pulls down the flag 
                         on the meter and starts the cab.

               INT. CAB  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE

               Ernie is puzzled by the stranger.

                                     GEORGE
                         Look here, Ernie, straighten me out 
                         here.  I've got some bad liquor or 
                         something.  Listen to me now. Now, 
                         you are Ernie Bishop, and you live 
                         in Bailey Park with your wife and 
                         kid? That's right, isn't it?

                                     ERNIE
                              (suspiciously)
                         You seen my wife?

                                     GEORGE
                              (exasperated)
                         Seen your wife? I've been to your 
                         house a hundred times.

                                     ERNIE
                         Look, bud, what's the idea?  I live 
                         in a shack in Potter's Field and my 
                         wife ran away three years ago and 
                         took the kid...  And I ain't never 
                         seen you before in my life.

                                     GEORGE
                         Okay. Just step on it. Just get me 
                         home.

               Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger. 
               As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing 
               beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions 
               to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. 
               Bert gets into his car and follows.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house.

                                     ERNIE
                         Is this the place?

                                     GEORGE
                         Of course it's the place.

                                     ERNIE
                         Well, this house ain't been lived in 
                         for twenty years.

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house.  
               Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof 
               has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. 
               Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.

               EXT. CAB  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and 
               Ernie stand watching George's actions.

                                     BERT
                         What's up, Ernie?

                                     ERNIE
                         I don't know, but we better keep an 
                         eye on this guy. He's bats.

               Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the 
               beam toward the old house.

               INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, 
               by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging 
               and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice 
               that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!  
                         Where are you?

               Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.

                                     CLARENCE
                         They're not here, George. You have 
                         no children.

                                     GEORGE
                              (ignoring him)
                         Where are you?
                              (then, to Clarence)
                         What have you done with them?

               INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. 
               Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.

                                     BERT
                         All right, put up your hands. No 
                         fast moves. Come on out here, both 
                         of you.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert! Thank heaven you're here!

               He rushes toward Bert.

                                     BERT
                         Stand back.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, what's happened to this house?  
                         Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

                                     ERNIE
                              (warningly)
                         Watch him, Bert.

                                     BERT
                         Come on, come on.

                                     GEORGE
                              (bewildered)
                         Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with 
                         you two guys? You were here on my 
                         wedding night. You, both of you, 
                         stood out here on the porch and sung 
                         to us, don't you remember?

                                     ERNIE
                              (nervously)
                         Think I'd better be going.

                                     BERT
                         Look, now why don't you be a good 
                         kid and we'll take you in to a doctor.  
                         Everything's going to be all right.

               Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George 
               struggles with him, trying to explain.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will 
                         you take me over to my mother's house? 
                         Bert, listen!
                              (gesturing to Clarence)
                         It's that fellow there  he says 
                         he's an angel  he's tried to 
                         hypnotize me.

                                     BERT
                         I hate to do this, fella.

               Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does 
               so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, 
               forcing him to let George go.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Run... George! Run, George!

               George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert 
               grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, 
               wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on 
               Clarence.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Help! Joseph, help!

                                     BERT
                         Oh, shut up!

                                     CLARENCE
                         Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!

               Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert 
               gets up, amazed by his vanishing.

                                     BERT
                         Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had 
                         him right here.

               Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright.

                                     ERNIE
                              (stammering)
                         I need a drink.

               He runs out of the scene.

                                     BERT
                         Well, which way'd they go? Help me 
                         find 'em.

               EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George runs up the path to the front door of the house and 
               raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, 
               when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: 
               "Ma Bailey's Boarding House."

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR

               The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but 
               she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In 
               her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold 
               suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Well?

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother...

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Mother? What do you want?

               It is a cruel blow to George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mother, this is George. I thought 
                         sure you'd remember me.

                                     MA BAILEY
                              (coldly)
                         George who? If you're looking for a 
                         room there's no vacancy.

               She starts to close the door, but George stops her.

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.  
                         Something terrible's happened to me. 
                         I don't know what it is. Something's 
                         happened to everybody. Please let me 
                         come in. Keep me here until I get 
                         over it.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         Get over what? I don't take in 
                         strangers unless they're sent here 
                         by somebody I know.

                                     GEORGE
                              (desperate)
                         Well, I know everybody you know. 
                         Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

                                     MA BAILEY
                              (suspiciously)
                         You know him?

                                     GEORGE
                         Well, sure I do.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         When'd you see him last?

                                     GEORGE
                         Today, over at the house.

                                     MA BAILEY
                         That's a lie. He's been in the insane 
                         asylum ever since he lost his 
                         business.  And if you ask me, that's 
                         where you belong.

               She slams the door shut in George's face.

               EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out 
               to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features 
               are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see 
               Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his 
               volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life 
                         touches so many other lives, and 
                         when he isn't around he leaves an 
                         awful hole, doesn't he?

                                     GEORGE
                              (quietly, trying to 
                              use logic)
                         I've heard of things like this. You've 
                         got me in some kind of a spell, or 
                         something.  Well, I'm going to get 
                         out of it. I'll get out of it. I 
                         know how, too. I... the last man I 
                         talked to before all this stuff 
                         started happening to me was Martini.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You know where he lives?

                                     GEORGE
                         Sure I know where he lives. He lives 
                         in Bailey Park.

               They walk out of scene.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey 
               Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, 
               with graves where the houses used to be.

                                     CLARENCE
                         Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. 
                         All I know is this should be Bailey 
                         Park. But where are the houses?

               The two walk into the cemetery.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (as they go)
                         You weren't here to build them.

               CLOSE MOVING SHOT

               George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, 
               Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare 
               with frightened eyes at:

               CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE

               Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George 
               scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, 
               and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY  
               1911-1919"

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

                                     CLARENCE
                         Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke 
                         through the ice and was drowned at 
                         the age of nine.

               George jumps up.

                                     GEORGE
                         That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to 
                         war! He got the Congressional Medal 
                         of Honor! He saved the lives of every 
                         man on that transport.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (sadly)
                         Every man on that transport died. 
                         Harry wasn't there to save them 
                         because you weren't there to save 
                         Harry. You see, George, you really 
                         had a wonderful life.  Don't you see 
                         what a mistake it would be to throw 
                         it away?

               CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence...

                                     CLARENCE
                         Yes, George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Where's Mary?

                                     CLARENCE
                         Oh, well, I can't...

                                     GEORGE
                         I don't know how you know these 
                         things, but tell me  where is she?

               George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I...

                                     GEORGE
                         If you know where she is, tell me 
                         where my wife is.

                                     CLARENCE
                         I'm not supposed to tell.

                                     GEORGE
                              (becoming violent)
                         Please, Clarence, tell me where she 
                         is.

                                     CLARENCE
                         You're not going to like it, George.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouting)
                         Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                         She's an old maid. She never married.

                                     GEORGE
                              (choking him)
                         Where's Mary? Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                         She's...

                                     GEORGE
                         Where is she?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (in self-defense)
                         She's just about to close up the 
                         library!

               George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the 
               ground, where he rubs his neck.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (to himself)
                         There must be some easier way for me 
                         to get my wings.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. LIBRARY  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see 
               George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different 
                no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love 
               of life.  Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close 
               to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-
               satisfied and efficient.

               CLOSEUP

               George, as he watches her.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and Mary, on the sidewalk.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

               She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues 
               on.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

               Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary!

               He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a 
               tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary, it's George! Don't you know 
                         me?  What's happened to us?

                                     MARY
                              (struggling)
                         I don't know you! Let me go!

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to 
                         me.  Please, Mary, help me. Where's 
                         our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me, 
                         Mary!

               Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door 
               she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar.

               INT. BLUE MOON  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many 
               of the people are the same who were present during the run 
               on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming. 
               The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically 
               insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.

                                     GEORGE
                              (shouting)
                         Mary...
                              (to men holding him)
                         Let me go! Mary, don't run away!

                                     MAN
                         Somebody call the police!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         Hit him with a bottle!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         He needs a strait jacket!

                                     MARY
                              (from back of room)
                         That man  stop him!

                                     GEORGE
                              (recognizing some of 
                              them)
                         Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!

               Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a 
               couple of women at the bar.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary!

                                     MAN
                         Oh, no you don't!

                                     GEORGE
                              (screaming)
                         Mary!

               George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperately 
               he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?

               EXT. SIDEWALK  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his 
               police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into 
               George as he comes out.

                                     BERT
                         Oh, it's you!

               He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the 
               button, knocking him down, then continues running down the 
               street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun 
               and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.

                                     BERT
                              (to crowd)
                         Stand back!

               Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets 
               off in pursuit of George.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The same part of the bridge where George was standing before 
               Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through 
               this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is 
               frantically looking for Clarence.

                                     GEORGE
                         Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. 
                         Get me back. Get me back. I don't 
                         care what happens to me. Only get me 
                         back to my wife and kids. Help me, 
                         Clarence, please!  Please! I want to 
                         live again!

               CLOSEUP

               George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.

                                     GEORGE
                         I want to live again. I want to live 
                         again. Please, God, let me live again.

               George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind 
               dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall.

               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE SOBBING AT THE RAILING

               The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert 
               comes into scene.

                                     BERT
                         Hey, George! George! You all right?

               George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again.

                                     BERT
                         Hey, what's the matter?

                                     GEORGE
                              (warningly)
                         Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll 
                         hit you again! Get out!

                                     BERT
                         What the Sam Hill you yelling for, 
                         George?

                                     GEORGE
                         Don't... George?

               George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly  
               George's mouth is bleeding again.

                                     GEORGE
                         Bert, do you know me?

                                     BERT
                         Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been 
                         looking all over town trying to find 
                         you.  I saw your car piled into that 
                         tree down there, and I thought 
                         maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding; 
                         are you sure you're all right?

                                     GEORGE
                         What did...

               George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth 
               with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds.

                                     GEORGE
                              (joyously)
                         My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's 
                         bleed...
                              (feeling in watch 
                              pocket)
                         Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're...  
                         they're here, Bert! What do you know 
                         about that? Merry Christmas!

               He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at 
               top speed toward town.

                                     LONG SHOT
                         George runs away from camera yelling

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes 
               running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, 
               pats the car, and dashes on.

               EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by 
               the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign.

                                     GEORGE
                         Hello, Bedford Falls!

               He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street 
               of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in 
               its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the 
               street

                                     GEORGE
                         Merry Christmas!

               CLOSE SHOT

               George notices a light in Potter's office window, and races 
               across the street.

               INT. POTTER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. 
               George pounds on the window.

                                     GEORGE
                              (from outside)
                         Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

               George runs off as Potter looks up from his work.

                                     POTTER
                         Happy New Year to you  in jail! Go 
                         on home  they're waiting for you!

               INT. GEORGE'S HOME  NIGHT

               The lights are on. There is a fire in the fireplace. The 
               Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked 
               around.

               INT. ENTRANCE HALL  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and 
               photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for 
               George. George comes dashing in the front door.

                                     GEORGE
                              (excitedly)
                         Mary...
                              (sees the men)
                         Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!

               He grabs his hand and shakes it.

                                     CARTER
                              (surprised)
                         Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit!

                                     GEORGE
                         I know. Eight thousand dollars.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (reaching into pocket)
                         George, I've got a little paper here.

                                     GEORGE
                              (happily)
                         I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.  
                         Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas!

               The photographer sets off a flash bulb.

                                     GEORGE
                         Reporters? Where's Mary?
                              (calling)
                         Mary!

               George runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. As he goes:

                                     GEORGE
                         Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty 
                         house! Mary! Mary!

               He comes running back to the hall.

                                     GEORGE
                         Have you seen my wife?

                                     CHILDREN'S VOICES
                         Merry Christmas, Daddy! Merry

               INT. STAIRS  NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in 
               their pajamas.

                                     GEORGE
                         Kids!

               George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar 
               knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it 
               lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs.

                                     GEORGE
                         Pete  kids  Janie  Tommy.
                              (takes them in his 
                              arms)
                         I could eat you up!

               CLOSE SHOT

               George and the kids. He is hugging them.

                                     GEORGE
                         Where's your mother?

                                     JANIE
                         She went looking for you with Uncle 
                         Billy.

               Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom. George crushes her to 
               him.

                                     ZUZU
                         Daddy!

                                     GEORGE
                         Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! 
                         How do you feel?

                                     ZUZU
                         Fine.

                                     JANIE
                         And not a smitch of temperature.

                                     GEORGE
                              (laughing)

               CLOSE SHOT

               As Mary comes through the door, breathless and excited. The 
               four men are watching with open mouths.

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                         Hallelujah!

                                     MARY
                              (to the men)
                         Hello.
                              (sees George)
                         George! Darling!

               INT. STAIRS  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce 
               embrace.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Mary!

                                     MARY
                         George, darling! Where have you been?

               George and Mary embrace tearfully.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, George, George, George.

                                     GEORGE
                         Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're 
                         real!

                                     MARY
                         Oh, George, George!

                                     GEORGE
                         You have no idea what's happened to 
                         me.

                                     MARY
                         You have no idea what happened...

               He stops her with a kiss. She leads him excitedly down the 
               stairs.

                                     MARY
                         Well, come on, George, come on 
                         downstairs quick. They're on their 
                         way.

                                     GEORGE
                         All right.

               INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on 
               his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree.

                                     MARY
                         Come on in here now. Now, you stand 
                         right over here, by the tree. Right 
                         there, and don't move, don't move. I 
                         hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle! 
                         It's a miracle!

               She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS 
               of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, 
               covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with 
               money, bursts in. He is followed by Ernie, and about twenty 
               more townspeople.

                                     MARY
                         Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In 
                         here!

               Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room. A 
               table stands in front of George. George picks up Zuzu to 
               protect her from the mob. Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of 
               money out onto the table  the money overflows and falls all 
               over.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                         Isn't it wonderful?

               The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and 
               smiles.  Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, 
               in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table  
               pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but 
               lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. 
               More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of 
               "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out 
               its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George 
               stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he 
               sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.  Tears 
               course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets 
               them.

                                     UNCLE BILLY
                              (emotionally at the 
                              breaking point)
                         Mary did it, George! Mary did it! 
                         She told a few people you were in 
                         trouble and they scattered all over 
                         town collecting money.  They didn't 
                         ask any questions  just said: "If 
                         George is in trouble  count on me." 
                         You never saw anything like it.

               Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes.

                                     TOM
                         What is this, George? Another run on 
                         the bank?

               Charlie adds his money to the pile.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

               Ernie is trying to get some system into the chaos.

                                     ERNIE
                         The line forms on the right.

               Mr. Martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with 
               cash.

                                     ERNIE
                         Mr. Martini! Merry Christmas! Step 
                         right up here.

               Martini dumps his money on the table.

                                     MARTINI
                         I busted the juke-box, too!

               Mr. Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes.

                                     ERNIE
                         Mr. Gower!

                                     GOWER
                              (to George)
                         I made the rounds of my charge 
                         accounts.

               Violet Bick arrives, and takes out the money George had given 
               her for her trip to New York.

                                     GEORGE
                         Violet Bick!

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not going to go, George. I changed 
                         my mind.

               Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long 
               black stocking.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've been saving this money for a 
                         divorce, if ever I get a husband.

               Mr. Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor.

                                     PARTRIDGE
                         There you are, George. I got the 
                         faculty all up out of bed.
                              (hands his watch to 
                              Zuzu)
                         And here's something for you to play 
                         with.

                                     MAN
                              (giving money)
                         I wouldn't have a roof over my head 
                         if it wasn't for you, George.

               Ernie is reading a telegram he has just received.

                                     ERNIE
                         Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. 
                         Quiet  quiet. Now, this is from 
                         London.
                              (reading)
                         Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop. 
                         My office instructed to advance you 
                         up to twenty-five thousand dollars. 
                         Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas. 
                         Sam Wainwright.

               The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on 
               top of the pile of money on the table.

                                     MARY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

               As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and 
               glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. 
               She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the 
               entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS 
               of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are 
               still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, 
               the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly 
               looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In 
               the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, 
               accompanied by Bert, the cop.

                                     HARRY
                         Hello, George, how are you?

                                     GEORGE
                         Harry... Harry...

                                     HARRY
                              (as he sees the money)
                         Mary  looks like I got here too 
                         late.

                                     BERT
                         Mary, I got him here from the airport 
                         as quickly as I could. The fool flew 
                         all the way up here in a blizzard.

               Mrs. Bailey enters scene.

                                     MRS. BAILEY
                         Harry, how about your banquet in New 
                         York?

                                     HARRY
                         Oh, I left right in the middle of it 
                         as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

               Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.

                                     HARRY
                         Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my 
                         big brother, George. The richest man 
                         in town!

               Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie 
               at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld 
               Lang syne," and everyone joins in.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the 
               pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top 
               of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's 
               copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription 
               written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure 
               who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."

                                     MARY
                              (looking at book)
                         What's that?

                                     GEORGE
                         That's a Christmas present from a 
                         very dear friend of mine.

               At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of 
               the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver 
               bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery 
               tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the 
               bell.

                                     ZUZU
                         Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every 
                         time a bell rings an angel gets his 
                         wings.

                                     GEORGE
                              (smiling)
                         That's right, that's right.

               He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.

                                     GEORGE
                         Attaboy, Clarence.

               The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo 
               for the

                                                                   FADE OUT

               A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to.

               
               After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.

               

                                     WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)
                           I was 25 years old the first time I
                           died...

               

               INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY


               
               One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from
               William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him
               as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured
               soldiers.

               
               Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood --
               and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull.

               
               Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled
               sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does
               the pace of the world around him.

                           I remember there was so much white
                           everywhere. And I felt peace...even
                           though there was war around me. And I
                           felt alive, even though I knew I was
                           dead.

                           guys and get them out of here.

               
               An INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving
               body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls
               the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for
               his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand.

                           He hasn't got a family listed. The

                           do with him.

               
               As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide-
               open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life.
               She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS
               blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her.

                           blinked!

                           the others... [then seeing STARKS
                           blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We
                           need a doctor! Get a doctor over here

               As the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS, preparing NEEDLES
               and OXYGEN MASKS, STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow
               the now BLOODIED white sheet as it falls to the ground...

               A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) -- a
               particularly photogenic and affable participant.

                           The level of arms on the ground
                           really depends. [Answering a
                           question] But no, I'd have to say we
                           haven't had to engage on the ground
                           as heavily as we might have expected.

               

                                     NEWSANCHOR
                           Have you lost any men today, Captain?

               

                                     CAPTAIN MEDLEY
                           No. One of my Corporals took a bullet
                           to the head, but it looks like he
                           might make it. Looks that way...

               

                                                        FLASHBACK TO:

               We see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs,
               enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound
               pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head
               in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off.

               

               EXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAY


               
               STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily
               BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a
               MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him.

               
               STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before --
               is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains
               well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would
               have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.

               

                                     DOCTOR
                           Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A
                           little more to the right and it
                           wouldn't have wanted to come out...

               

                                     MAJOR
                           But he's never gonna be able to
                           remember what happened?

               

                                     DOCTOR
                           It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks
                           could have retrograde amnesia
                           or... [lowering his voice] any form of
                           psychological suppression. It's very
                           common with traumas like this.

                           Sergeant Starks is in the room,
                           [beat] and I want to know when I'm
                           going home.

               
               When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a
               man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his
               surroundings.

               

                                     LIEUTENANT
                           Sergeant, you have no surviving
                           family in the States. I'm sure you
                           have friends or distant relatives,
                           but unfortunately we have no record
                           of them yet.

               

                                     MAJOR
                           Captain Medley has recommended you
                           for the Purple Heart, Sergeant.

               

                                                                              4.

               
               STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the
               CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket.

               

                                      STARKS
                            Can I have one of those?

               

                                      LIEUTENANT
                            Of course.

               
               The LIEUTENANT lights one for him.

               

                                      DOCTOR
                            There is help for you, Sergeant.

               

                                      LIEUTENANT
                            Of course there is.
               Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette,
               blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes.
               He's finished with these men and everything they stand for.

               

                                      STARKS [V.O.]
                            I didn't know where my home was. I
                            just knew I didn't want to be there
                            anymore.

               

               EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY


               
               STARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long
               highway. He seems to be walking away from things even if he
               can't remember what they are yet.

               

               EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY


               
               JEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and
               her daughter, JACKIE (8) tremble in the cold next to their
               stalled car. JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to
               her chest, more like a child than her daughter.

               
               JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted
               head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them. He cuts
               an arresting figure against the empty landscape.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...

               

                                      STARKS
                            You two ok?

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Our car won't start.

               

                                                                               5.

               
                                     STARKS [Looking at JEAN]
                           What's your mom's name?

               
                                     JACKIE [Cautiously]
                           Jean.

               
               STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need
                           you to try to wake up, Jean.

               
               JEAN opens her eyes, stone red.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Your mom take anything before this
                           happened?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Yeah, but I don't know what.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] What's your name?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Jackie.

               
               JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand. STARKS smiles
               and briefly shakes it. STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and
               cheek as he thinks of what to do.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't
                           you wrap this scarf around yourself
                           and try to keep your mom awake while
                           I take a look at your car.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY


               
               As Starks works on their engine, JACKIE anxiously watches her
               mother throw up in the distance. STARKS sees her watching and
               tries to distract her.

               

                                     STARKS
                           What do you think of all this snow?

               
               JACKIE looks at him curiously.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           [Beat] Nothing.

               
               STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie
               turns her head back towards her mother.

               

                                                                               6.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           But I like it I guess.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?

               

                                       JACKIE
                           Yeah.

               
               JACKIE gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just
               enough so her foot reaches the pedal.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing
                           it.

               
               JACKIE revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters
               later, the car settles into a nice, working hum.

               
                                       JACKIE [Smiling]
                           It works!

               
               JACKIE steps down. She looks like she could hug Starks and,
               unexpectedly, decides to. As STARKS awkwardly returns it, he
               sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter.

               

                                     JEAN
                           Get your fucking hands off my
                           daughter!

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Mom, he just fixed our car.

               

                                     JEAN
                           Jackie, get in the car. NOW!

               
               JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but
               stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up.

               

                                     JEAN
                           Look, I don't want any trouble, so...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my
                           way.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Mom, you've got it wrong...

               
               STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           You're just gonna walk?

               

                                                                               7.

               

                                        STARKS
                              Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.
                              [Beat] Let her throw it all up before
                              she gets back behind the wheel.

               
               STARKS' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              What're those?

               

                                        STARKS
                              Dog tags. [Off her blank look]
                              They've got your name and date of
                              birth for identification.

               

                                          JACKIE
                              What for?

               

                                        STARKS
                              [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't
                              remember who you are.

               
                                          JACKIE [Still looking at them]
                              Hm.

               
               STARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them.

               

                                        STARKS
                              I think I can remember what's on
                              them.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.

               

                                                            CUT TO:

               

               INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT


               
               STARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic BLACKNESS
               about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE
               questions him.

               

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                              "Jackie" and "Jean" are the only
                              ...things you know for certain about
                              that day?

               
               STARKS nods.

               

                                                                               8.

               

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                           Are you aware we have no last name,
                           no place of residence, and no record
                           of any physical presence for these
                           "friends" of yours? How's that
                           possible in this day and age?

               
               STARKS nods as a muffled "Objection" flickers away in the
               background...

               

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                           I may need to actually hear that
                           answer, Mr. Starks.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Yes.
               With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is
               suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS' OWN
               TRIAL. The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns
               to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on...

               

               INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT


               
               There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN
               MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR.
               HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first
               came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are
               intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and
               confusingly -- just like it appears to himself.

               
                                     OFFICER NASH [Emotional]
                           Eddie [correcting himself], Officer
                           Harrison, was lying in a pool of his
                           own blood -- on his back.

               

                                     DR. HALE
                           William Starks could be blocking the
                           incident. It would explain his well-
                           systematized scheme about the little
                           girl and her mother. A delusion as
                           complex as that can often replace the
                           reality of an incident like this.

               
                                     OFFICER NASH [Cont'd]
                           Officer Harrison'd been shot three
                           times. He was long dead by the time
                           we got there.

               

                                                                              9.

               

                                     DR. HALE
                           I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome.
                           The medical community is only
                           beginning to gather information about
                           it.

                           Gulf War   Syndrome? What the...Why
                           don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life
                           Syndrome   while we're at it? I've
                           gotten a   lot of convictions we could
                           overturn   with that logic...

               

                                     CAPTAIN MEDLEY
                           Sergeant Starks was awarded the
                           Purple Heart. That award doesn't
                           applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It
                           applauds honor.

               
                                     DR. HALE [Cont'd]
                           His subconscious is blocking it, the
                           same way it began to in the Gulf,
                           particularly as something similarly
                           traumatizing happened to him then.

               
               The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES
               between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they
               speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony.

               
                                     PROSECUTION [Disdainfully]
                           It's not a question of whether or not
                           he was sane when he did it?! He
                           absolutely was. Three bullets in one
                           man are three moral failings in
                           another.

               
                                     CAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed]
                           War isn't a CNN Special. Half the
                           shit that went on couldn't be tidied
                           into a top of the hour headline --
                           either 'cause it couldn't be said
                           neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said
                           at all. It was ugly. And they don't
                           put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks]
                           If Starks did kill that officer
                           ... [Beat] You can't hold a man
                           responsible for a damaged mind.

               

                                                                              10.

               

                                     DEFENSE
                           For God's sake, my client said he
                           thinks he's already died once. He
                           doesn't know what's going on.

               

                                                           FLASHBACK TO:

               

               EXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK


               
               STARKS lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by OFFICER HARRISON'S
               dead, bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both
               and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind. We
               hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment...

               
                                     STARKS [V.O., nearly whispered]
                           I don't know how it happened.
               STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness.

               

               INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT


               
               The JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the verdict.

               

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                           On the count of first degree murder,
                           we find the defendant, William
                           Starks, not guilty by reason of
                           insanity.

               

               EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY


               
               In his mind, STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun
               sets and bounces off the snow all around him. We see JACKIE
               watching him walk away into the woods.

               

                                     JUDGE (O.S.)
                           I hereby sentence you to be committed
                           to a facility for the criminally
                           insane, where I hope that doctors and
                           the proper treatment can help you...

               

               INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT


               
               The JUDGE sentences STARKS, who stares back vacantly, like a
               man who checked out of his life long before this judge
               decided he had to.

               

               EXT. ALPINE GROVE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL, DAY


               
               A white VAN pulls up to Alpine Grove Psychiatric Hospital -- a
               bleak, dated facility embellished only by the barbed wire
               that seems to be everywhere around it.

               

                                                                             11.

               
               STARKS' anatomy instantly and intensely separates him from
               the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who might
               be in it. TWO MEMBERS of that STAFF lead him in.

               

                                     JUDGE [O.S.]
                           Mr. Starks, I hope that someday you
                           might be well so that we will have
                           lost only one life in this tragedy.

               

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, ALPINE GROVE MENTAL HOSPITAL


               
               DR. THOMAS BECKER (overworked, dogmatic, disenchanted), DR.
               BETH LORENSON (30s, unassuming, perceptive), and DR. GRIES
               (20s, green) are convened with other STAFF at a routine
               hospital meeting. These doctors deal in the currency of
               madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on
               their faces.

               

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                           I'd certainly say he should be
                           considered violent, just given his
                           case...

               

                                     DR. BECKER
                           How'd he dodge a conviction?

               

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                           His defense argued post-traumatic
                           stress and delusional disorder. He
                           evidently couldn't account for a
                           similar incident during his service
                           in Desert Storm.

               

                                     DR. BECKER
                           [Beat] So why isn't he just in the
                           psych ward of the county jail?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                           Apparently, he's a decorated vet. And
                           had another one testify for him. Who
                           knows? [To DR. BECKER] Tom, do you
                           mind taking him?

               
               BECKER shrugs a nod as the Chief moves on to the next order
               of business...

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               STARKS is shown to his room by NURSE HARDING -- stern, senior --
               and her henchman, DAMON -- a BURLY ORDERLY who relishes his
               command, however diluted it may be.

               
               DAMON unceremoniously puts Starks' UNIFORM on the bed. He and
               NURSE HARDING wait at the door for Starks to change into it.

               

                                                                            12.

               
               DAMON looks at STARKS -- his eyes inadvertently conceding that
               Starks is more threatening than the common senile he
               marshals; STARKS stares him back -- deliberately conceding
               that he's right.

               
               STARKS turns around -- only then looking stunned in the
               sterile, cotton-white room, wondering where his life
               disappeared to.

               

               INT. DR. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               STARKS sits opposite DR. BECKER in a harsh, tiled office.
               STARKS wears his blue uniform and BECKER wears a doubtful
               expression. From STARKS' P.O.V.: the DRUGS they've already
               started giving him BLUR his vision of Becker.

               

                                     BECKER
                           William? William, can you hear me?

               
               STARKS nods groggily.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I've given you some drugs to help
                           with your adjustment...

               
                                      STARKS [Cutting him off]
                            What kind of drugs? [Beat] 'Cause
                            these seem pretty...pretty serious.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Well, your condition's pretty
                           serious.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's
                           steady gaze] What?

                                     BECKER
                           I'm just looking at you. Does that
                           make you uncomfortable?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Depends on what you're seeing.

               
               BECKER eyes STARKS mistrustfully.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You said you couldn't remember
                           killing Officer Harrison. Correct?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] You don't believe me, do you?

               

                                                                             13.

               

                                     BECKER
                           It's not my job to believe you.

               
                                     STARKS [Squinting to better see]
                           You're a doctor. I would think...

               
                                     BECKER [Cutting him off firmly]
                           It's not my job to believe you or to
                           understand you. It's my job to try to
                           cure you and if that's a no-go, then
                           to...take some kind of care of you.

               
                                       STARKS [Flatly]
                           Lucky me.

               
               BECKER looks at Starks -- his eyes casting shame upon the
               alleged murderer that sits before him.

               
                                     BECKER [Stupefied]
                           You shot a man three times: first in
                           his heart, then in his stomach and
                           then...point blank, in the back of
                           his head. And then you just...forgot
                           all about it. A whole life erased
                           with three easy little words: I.
                           Don't. Know. What would it be if we
                           could all not know what we didn't
                           want to have to face.

               
               BECKER glances at his WATCH and gets up -- still blurred in
               Starks' P.O.V. It's only as he's walking off that Starks
               notices he has a limp.

               

                                                         FADE TO:

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

               From STARKS' P.O.V., we follow him walk down the hospital
               halls, even hazier from the medication than before. FORMS
               blur into one another and, on either side of him is a crazy
               world with crazy patients who've lost their way in it.

               
               STARKS reaches for the WALL and runs his HAND over it, trying
               to keep his balance. He's walking towards BECKER who stands
               at the end of the hall, talking to other PATIENTS.

               
                                     STARKS [Softly]
                           I don't belong here. I don't...

               
               STARKS falters but stays up. He turns to see a shell of an
               OLD MAN looking right through him with wooden eyes. STARKS'
               eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man's haunting sight
               that he doesn't see what's ahead of him.

               

                                                                              14.

               
               He bumps right into a HYSTERICAL PATIENT whose sudden,
               earsplitting SCREAMS peal interminably through the air.

               
                                     STARKS [Mumbling]
                           I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm
                           sorry. I didn't mean it.

               
               STARKS' fumbled efforts to help the PATIENT only feed his
               hysteria more. The SCREAMING is intolerable.

               
                                     STARKS [Forced to yell]
                           Will you listen to me? I'm not going
                           to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean
                           to bump...I'm sorry.

               
               ORDERLIES and NURSES, followed by DR. BECKER, surround them
               now, violently pulling STARKS off the patient. BECKER,
               familiar with the PATIENT (HAROLD), tries to calm him.

               

                                     BECKER
                           It's ok, Harold. It's ok.

               
               STARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker's as
               they restrain him and give him more drugs.

               
                                     STARKS [To Becker]
                           I don't belong here...

               
                                     BECKER [Angrily, to the ORDERLIES]
                           Get him to his room.

               

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT


               
               STARKS is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears
               disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer and
               closer...

               
               What follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react.

               
               DR. GRIES, NURSE HARDING AND DAMON -- enter Starks' room.
               They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and
               a GAG.

               
               STARKS has no idea what's happening to him as they drag him
               out, and his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either.

               

                                      NURSE HARDING
                            Come on, army boy. Time for some
                            therapy.

               

                                                                              15.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT


               
               The first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is
               NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR.
               GRIES and DAMON.

               
               A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus
               hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus
               designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly-
               stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would
               first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped
               around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests
               its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.

               
               STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying
               nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement.
               Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them
               as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks,
               sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to
               him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Wait. Wait a minute... Please.

               
               BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks,
               trying to bring the faces above him into focus...

               

                                     STARKS
                           I, I don't belong here.

               
               BECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back.

               

                                     BECKER
                           No. I don't think you do either.
                           [Beat] But neither of us can do
                           anything about that.
               BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with
               METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably
               about Starks' treatment.

               
               A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall
               enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS,
               already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside.

               
               The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.

               

               INT. CADAVER DRAWER


               
               STARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath.
               They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body.
               The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his
               heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle.

               

                                                                              16.

               
               We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man
               who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all
               intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death.

               
               Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's
               happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost
               like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in
               the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger...

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               It's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS
               stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with
               formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern
               before they change into something else. Only after STARKS
               blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW
               from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in
               the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time
               between BLINKS.

               
                1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it,
                spilling from...

               
                2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last
                breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH...

               
                 3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him.

               
               BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and
               realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks
               up from his hands and sees in similar flashes...

               
                1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS
                stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes
                from...

               
                 2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one...

               
                3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her
                hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its
                blood on her face just before she lies back down among
                the dead, content to be one of them.

               
               The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a
               trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART
               pumping so fast it could be a drum...

               
               The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes
               shut.

               

                                                                              17.

               

               INT. CADAVER DRAWER


               
               Just then, as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to VIBRATE,
               something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the
               drawer. PING! Right on his eye. The drop of WATER is enough
               to send this man right over the edge.

               
               STARKS' EYES roll back into his head and start to flutter,
               shaking the SCREEN right along them until...

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE


               
               STARKS stands outside his body, looking at the wall of
               drawers he is in. He bends down to look more closely at a
               STAIN on the floor -- DRIED BLOOD -- and as he runs his HAND over
               it and stands back up, he is back in the...

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               IMAGES RACE PAST HIM too fast for him to catch anything but
               fleeting clips of them. The IMAGES are his MEMORY and, no
               matter how badly he wants to slow them down, he can't...

               

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

               

               INT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT


               
               STARKS sees JACKIE, 8, sitting by a window in the diner. She
               turns her head towards the ENTRANCE and, as she looks there,
               so does Starks. That is when he first lays eyes on a woman, a
               WAITRESS -- worn but still lovely -- leaving the diner. He is
               taken with her and, for the first time since he's been in the
               Jacket, seems calm. Just then, however, the reverie is
               shattered...

               

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT


               
               The drawer is yanked open to reveal STARKS' still, drenched
               face. BECKER, GRIES and the ORDERLIES stand above him.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Take him out of it.

               
               The ORDERLIES unstrap the JACKET from his body. Blood from
               his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab. STARKS' eyes
               remain closed.

               

                                     BECKER
                           William. William, can you hear me?

               

                                                                              18.

               
               We hear BECKER's voice as it sounds to STARKS...MUTED.
               STARKS' EYES open only enough for him to see the PEOPLE'S
               FACES morph chillingly into one another's.

                           That's not enough, is it?

               
               BECKER looks at STARKS' battered body.

               
                                     BECKER [Wearily, indifferently]
                           It's enough for now. Take him to the
                           infirmary and let him recover there.

               

               INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, NEXT MORNING


               
               STARKS sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other,
               more vocally INSANE patients. He runs his hand uncertainly
               over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around --
               not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins.

               
               The OLD MAN from the previous day is moving slowly with the
               aid of his walker. He is far less threatening to STARKS
               today...just a senile man about to walk into a wall.

               
                                     STARKS [Getting up to help him]
                           Let's get you a destination other
                           than this wall.

               
               RUDY MACKENZIE -- 40s, smart eyes, fidgety, with an innocent
               face -- watches STARKS help turn the OLD MAN around.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears
                           us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to
                           bother answering so he makes us think
                           he can't talk. I know. I tried it on
                           my mother for two months once before
                           she fished out my tongue. Literally.

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?

                                     MACKENZIE (cont'd)
                           Welcome to the village, William
                           Starks.

               
               STARKS doesn't offer his hand, just looks back at MacKenzie.

               
                                      STARKS [Looking away]
                            I'm not really in the mood to talk.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           That's too bad. I don't believe in
                           disposable language either -- you
                           know, the small talk, the little
                           talk. Chit. Chat. Useless. The game's
                           something else though. Think about
                           it: What can we trade with each other
                           in the air between us? This...
                           [running his hand through the air] is
                           our court. [Beat, so eager it's sad]
                           I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

               
               STARKS looks at MACKENZIE and sees that the constant flow of
               words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his
               eyes. A dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight.

               
                                     STARKS [Relenting]
                           What are you in here for?

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           I tried to kill my wife.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Don't you go to jail for that?

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           I tried something like 30 times.
               There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to
               that.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           She's bigger than me, and she's
                           stronger than me. And I never planned
                           on doing it. It was always in the
                           heat of the moment. I didn't beat her
                           or anything. Hell, she beat me. But
                           when we'd start fighting, I'd go for
                           the knife. Then she kept threatening
                           to have me put away, and [looking
                           around] she finally did.

               
               As he talks, MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks' arms. Dr.
               LORENSON observes STARKS and MACKENZIE talking and starts
               walking towards them.

               

                                                                             20.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah, well 30 times probably would
                           make you seem crazy.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Or just plain stupid. You'd think by
                           the twentieth time, I'd have found an
                           alternative method. Maybe a more
                           effective one, if you know what I
                           mean.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing
                           today?

               
               MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies.

                                     MACKENZIE
                           It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson.
                           [Finally turns to face her, grimly]
                           The world around me, it's shrinking.
                           There's not even room for light to
                           make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da-
                           da-bum! I feel like the horseman of
                           doom is coming for me, Doc. Only
                           today, he's not carrying flowers.

               
               LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           What? It's better than fine.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           And you, Mr. Starks?

               
                                       STARKS [Already on the defense]
                           I'm fine.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could
                           talk to Mr. Starks privately?

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Of course you can, Doc. William, it
                           was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for
                           playing.

               
               Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously
               and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye.

               

                                                                             21.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Hey...when they talk you out to the
                           woods tonight and invite the wolves,
                           dance with them. [Beat] They don't
                           eat you when there's music playing.

               
               STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words
               were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie
               just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away --
               dead arm in tow.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           So you're ok?

               
                                     STARKS [Still distracted]
                           What?

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           I asked you if you're ok.

               
                                     STARKS [Suspiciously]
                           I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You
                           think there's anything wrong with me?

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           I don't know. You're not my patient.

               
               STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           You look like you've lost some
                           weight. Are you eating?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I am. One of the few things I
                           remember doing is eating. So I guess
                           I must be exercising it off in my
                           dreams.

               
               STARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON
               looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You done with your small talk?

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           Sure.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Good.

               
               STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't
               escape LORENSON's observation.

               

                                                                              22.

               

               INT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAY


               
               STARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit
               of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them,
               when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside
               one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it
               open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock.

               
               The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second
               stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the
               way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head
               just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink.

               
               DAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out.

               

                                     DAMON
                           I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen
                           you coming there.

               
               STARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now.

               
                                     DAMON [Leaning down close to him]
                           Were you worried about me? [Smiling]
                           That's so sweet. Thanks.

               
               With that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               STARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the
               night interrupted by first faint, then approaching,
               FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until
               DAMON and HARDING enter his room.

               
               They pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them
               one.

                                     NURSE HARDING
                           You gonna get the fuck up?

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               STARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own
               torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               They're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a
               C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET...

               

                                     BECKER
                           I'm glad to see you're cooperating
                           this time, Mr. Starks.

               

                                                                              23.

               
               STARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would
               really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with
               them. They might even knock someone out...

               
               DAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a
               move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that
               it's all right.

               
               DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps
               on one of Starks' bare feet.

               
               STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and
               bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE
               JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to
               smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the
               JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends
               Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and
               HARDING leap to restrain Starks.

               
               BECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into
               focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps
               BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the
               floor.   BECKER puts them on.

               

                                       DR. GRIES
                             Hold him while I get the
                             tranquilizer.

               

                                       DAMON
                             Fuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot.

               
               DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down.

               

                                       BECKER
                             No. That's not necessary.

               
               BECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor.
               He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at
               the force he just used.

               

                                       BECKER
                             Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let
                             him go!

               
               As soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER --
               pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably
               about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what
               he's capable of doing...

               
               BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks' eyes.

               

                                                                              24.

               
                                      BECKER [An inch away from his face]
                            What, Starks? What are you going to
                            do? End me just because I'm an
                            inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just
                            like you did with Officer Harrison?

               
               STARKS' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a
               look of self-doubt crosses his face.

               

                                     BECKER
                           The only thing your mind is missing
                           is a conscience.

               
               STARKS lets go of him and, as soon as he does, DAMON and
               HARDING restrain him. BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD from his
               face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out.

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Wait...Dr. Becker, how long do you
                           want us to leave him in for?

               
               BECKER doesn't answer. He doesn't even turn around. DR. GRIES
               goes after him.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Just strap him in for now.

               
               And DAMON and HARDING start to...

               

               INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE, SOME TIME


               LATER

               
               BECKER turns around from the window and we see that his cheek
               is BANDAGED. He opens a drawer, takes out some SCOTCH and
               pours himself a SHOT. He swallows some pills with it.

               
               After he drinks it, he looks up to see GRIES standing
               opposite him, watching.

               

                                       DR. GRIES
                           You ok?

               

                                       BECKER
                           I'm fine.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother
                           you...

               

                                     BECKER
                           Then don't.

               

                                                                          25.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           But... what about Starks?

               

                                     BECKER
                           What about Starks?

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Should we be...

               

                                     BECKER
                           Should we be what? Trying to change
                           him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           But the Jacket? I mean...should we be
                           leaving him in like that?
                                     BECKER [As if stunned by the question]
                           Leaving him in? [Beat] The medication
                           I'm given him is intended to adjust --
                           maybe even reset -- his violent
                           proclivities. You know, peel away
                           some of those layers of hate. The
                           Jacket's merely a safe place for that
                           to happen. The grounds and the halls --
                           where I can't monitor side effects I
                           can't predict -- aren't.

               
                                     DR. GRIES [Still doubtful]
                           But, but...what about...

               
                                     BECKER [Mocking Gries]
                           But...but what about the gun? I mean,
                           should he have been firing away like
                           that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You
                           can't fuck up a life that's already
                           been fucked up. [Turning away] There,
                           there's the insurance you're looking
                           for.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           I'm not looking for anything.

               
               BECKER shakes his head, laughing inside at the world's
               stupidity.

               

                                     BECKER
                           [Beat] It's Christmas Eve, Justin.
                           Don't you have somewhere to be?

               

                                                                              26.

               
               BECKER doesn't wait for an answer, just turns back towards
               the window and takes another sip of his drink.

               

                                                           CUT TO:

               

               INT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               NURSE HARDING turns on the television as DAMON sits in one of
               the lounge chairs.

               

                                     NURSE HARDING
                           Ah, man, look, It's A Wonderful Life.

               

                                     DAMON
                           You got any booze?

               
               HARDING takes out a FLASK from her BACKPACK.

               

                                     NURSE HARDING
                           'Course I do. [Smiling] And it is the
                           season for giving so let's get to it.

               
               DAMON smiles and rubs his hands together eagerly.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               A shot of the WALL OF DRAWERS, with no one in the room, just
               someone in the wall...

               

               INT. CADAVER DRAWER


               
               STARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place once
               more. But nothing happens for some seconds. He breathes
               anxiously, not knowing what to expect. His heart beats
               steadily: THUMP...THUMP, until, finally, with each beat, a
               SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecks...then, two
               dots...then, two circles...then, the WHITES of a pair of
               EYES with a terrific meanness in them.

               
               The EYES blink, then disappear like they were never there.

               
               The pace of STARKS' heart quickens, and the inexplicable
               madness surrounds him once more...

               

               EXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK


               
               The SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but he's in the middle of
               the murder scene, watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the floor.
               He turns to look over his shoulder and sees...

               

                                                                              27.

               

               EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT


               
               Through a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA, we see FIRE,
               FLESH, and RUIN littering the sand. Slowly the
               terrifying images shift to a naturalistic, real-time
               documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring.

               
               As STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a
               counseling voice...

               

                                     MACKENZIE (O.S.)
                           When they take you out to the woods
                           tonight and invite the wolves, dance
                           with them.

               
               The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away.

                                     MACKENZIE (O.S.)
                           They don't eat you when there's music
                           playing.

               
               The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear
               vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him.

               
                 1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK and a small child's HAND

               

                 2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME)


               
                 3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH

               
                 4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water, not too deep...


               

                 5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH


               
                 6) EXT. DESERT, IRAQ: A sublime sunset...


               
               STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES.
               They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the
               whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL
               WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE
               SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand.

               
               STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches
               out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold
               of the moment with this simple gesture.

               
               The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we...

               

                                                        CUT TO:

               

                                                                              28.

               

               EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin
               and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time --
               emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is
               remarkably pretty.

               
               From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there.
               STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed
               from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is
               that she's tired.

               
               She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both
               are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to
               hide any indication that she is.

               

               INT. WAITRESS' CAR


               
               She gets in her old car and starts it. As it warms up, she
               looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees he's still
               there.

               
               He starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car.

               

               EXT. PARKING LOT, DINER, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE


               
               The WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Where do you think you're going?

               
               STARKS looks at her. He doesn't know anymore than she does.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           You gonna answer me?

               
               STARKS just stares.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           If you're deaf, read my lips...I
                           don't need a psycho following me
                           today.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I'm not deaf.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Good.

               
               She turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut.
               She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her.

               

                                                                           29.

               
               After a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns
               the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and
               heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS.

               

               EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, SOME SECONDS LATER


               
               She comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs at
               Starks.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           [As if she owes him an explanation] I
                           forgot my purse.

               
               STARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks
               again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any
               winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans
               and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much
               because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't
               look like he belongs there.

               
               She reverses towards him.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           In case you hadn't figured, it's
                           Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get
                           a cab here.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Thanks.

               
               She looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           All right. [Beat] You got somewhere
                           you need to go, Mister?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm not sure.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Let me ask you that again. This time,
                           look around and consider your
                           options.

               
               Being cold and freezing are his options.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           [Beat] You got somewhere you need to
                           go, Mister?

               
                                     STARKS [Nodding slowly]
                           Yeah, I do.

               

                                                                              30.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Great, get in.

               

               INT. WAITRESS' CAR


               

                                     WAITRESS
                           So, where do you want me to drop you?

               
               STARKS rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it
               over. She watches him curiously.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm not sure.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           You don't have anywhere to stay?

                                     STARKS
                           I don't think so.

               
               The WAITRESS takes out a FLASK and a sizable SWIG from it;
               she swallows it smoothly, like someone used to doing so.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Well, where are you from?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really
                           know.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Of course you don't know.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Why "of course"?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Because in my life, it wouldn't make
                           sense for me to pick up some normal
                           guy with a place where he's from and
                           a place where he's going to. It'd be
                           too simple. I probably wouldn't know
                           how to handle a situation like that.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Well, you definitely didn't pick
                           normal or simple this time either.

               
               She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious. He looks back
               innocuously; there's something innately safe about him.

               

                                                                              31.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           At least you're honest. That's some
                           kind of start.

               
               STARKS sees her take another DRINK from the flask. She pulls
               out a CIGARETTE, and STARKS lights it for her with some

               MATCHES.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           That's great. You're not sure where
                           you're from or where you're going,
                           but at least you've got manners.

               
               She laughs, noticeably more relaxed now after the drink.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Well, you got a coat or something?

               
                                      STARKS [Looking down at his clothes]
                            No. Doesn't look like it.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Well, how'd you get here?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I was dropped off.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Do you have a motel or something?
                           Money?

               
               STARKS feels his pockets.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff?
                           Belongings?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. [Beat] Not around here.

               
               She casts a long sideward glance at STARKS, taking him and
               her circumstances in for herself. He looks back gently.

               

                                      WAITRESS
                            All right, we'll get to my place and
                            call around, see where I can take
                            you. [Beat] Just don't think of
                            trying anything.

                                      (MORE)

               

                                                                              32.

               
                                      WAITRESS (cont'd)
                            I have the biggest defense for gun
                            control living upstairs from me.
                            She's armed and angry even when she's
                            asleep.

               

               INT. WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING


               
               She is on the PHONE, calling various shelters.   Her apartment
               has some pieces of mismatched furniture, along   with a string
               of lopsided CHRISTMAS LIGHTS strewn around the   WINDOWS in the
               room. They, more than anything else, light the   place.

               
                                     WAITRESS [Pleading tone]
                           I could have him there in 15 minutes.
                           [Beat, disappointed] Hmm. Yeah,
                           thanks. Merry Christmas to you, too.

               
               She hangs up the phone.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Great. That was our last option. What
                           am I going to do with you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for
                           bringing me this far.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Where are you going? You'll freeze
                           out there. You don't even have a
                           coat.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'll manage.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           No, you won't. You'll die of cold out
                           there and then I'll have to feel
                           guilty. And I've already got more
                           guilt than I know what to do with.
                           [Beat] Do you want something to
                           drink?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No, I'm ok.

               
               She leaves to the KITCHEN to fix herself a drink and STARKS
               stares after her. Suddenly, a SMASHING SOUND is heard as
               something falls in the kitchen. STARKS' whole BODY TENSES UP
               as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the Jacket.

               

                                      WAITRESS
                           Shit! That was one of my good
                           glasses!

               

                                                                              33.

               
               As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly
               gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and
               pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she
               did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her
               weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She
               takes a long SIP.

               
                                     WAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken]
                           Hey, you ok?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           You know what? It's Christmas Eve.
                           And you look clean -- I mean, you're
                           normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her
                           own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and
                           I have a couch.

               
               And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back --
               her EYES even more tired from the liquor.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm not gonna hurt you.

               
                                     WAITRESS [Softly]
                           I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm
                           gonna go take a bath. Make yourself
                           at home. You know, fix yourself
                           something to eat if you're hungry or
                           anything. There's nothing to steal,
                           but don't be a jerk and take
                           something anyway. And don't snoop,
                           ok?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the
                           way.

               
                                     WAITRESS [Shakes her head]
                           No, no. Let's not do the name stuff,
                           'cause you see, I don't want to meet
                           you. I may want to help you tonight,
                           but I don't want to know you. Honest.

               
               STARKS nods as she walks out.

               

               EXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING


               
               STARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD...

               

                                                                              34.

               

               INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING


               
               STARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with --
               just some JARS and plenty of VODKA.

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATER


               
               STARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them
               when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           What's this?

               

                                     STARKS
                           The best I could do with what was in
                           your fridge.
               She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a
               SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other.

               
               Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way
               she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since
               someone's done something like this for her.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I only lit it because it was so cold
                           in here. I'm sorry if...

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow]
                           Thanks.

               
               She turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him...

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           You want a drink?

                                     STARKS
                           Sure.

               

               INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               As she makes their DRINKS, a curious LOOK crosses her face,
               just for a second.

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, A LITTLE WHILE LATER


               
               They've sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           This is pretty good. Considering...

               

                                                                              35.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Thanks.

               
               They eat quietly for a second. STARKS looks at her, then down
               at his food, still subtly stunned by it all.

               

                                     STARKS
                           So you're a waitress, right? I
                           mean...from the uniform you were
                           wearing.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Yup. That's me.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You like it?

                                     WAITRESS
                           [Beat] I do it.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Have you always been a waitress?

               
                                     WAITRESS [Remembering sadly]
                           No. I used to be a nurse.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Why'd you stop?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Shit happens, and your life changes.
                           'Bout the best explanation of a lot
                           of things that happen. [Beat] So how
                           come you don't know where you're
                           coming from?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know, but I think part of
                           it's...

               
               STARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with her.

               

                                     STARKS
                           That I don't really know what's real.

               
               She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on
               her lips.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Well, good for you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Why?

               

                                                                              36.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           [Beat] Real is overrated.

               
               STARKS smiles back uncertainly.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You don't think that's crazy?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.

               
               She holds up her glass somewhat sadly.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Sometimes I don't know the difference
                           myself. And, you know something? I
                           think I like it better that way.
                           [Finishes her drink] You want another
                           one?

               
               She goes to the KITCHEN, and STARKS clears their PLATES.

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT


               
               STARKS goes in the KITCHEN as she comes out with their
               drinks. He hears her turn on the RADIO. She lands on an
               OLDIES station that's playing "Girl of North Country" by Bob
               Dylan.

               

               INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               STARKS smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and
               likes, the song. It's the first familiar thing for him in
               days.

               
               He walks out slowly to the living room, where the WAITRESS
               sits on the couch, drinking. STARKS moves closer to the
               radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short
               while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything else.

               

                                     BOB DYLAN
                           If you go when the snow flakes storm
                           When the rivers freeze and summer
                           ends.
                           Please see she has a coat so warm
                           To keep her from the howlin' winds...

               
               STARKS listens close -- smiling a small, sad smile. Over the
               HARMONICA, we pull back and see two very lonely people
               passing time together the way people sometimes need to be
               able to.

               

                                                                            37.

               

                                     STARKS
                           This is a great song.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           You remember it?

               
                                      STARKS [Nodding slowly]
                            It's like I feel like...I know who I
                            am. I just can't remember anything
                            that made me this person.

               
               When STARKS looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown
               that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it.

               

                                     STARKS
                           But hey, who can forget those words?
                           The man just wants simple and good
                           things for his woman -- that she be
                           warm and happy. How hard can that be
                           to remember?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           May be easy to remember, but not easy
                           to get. Being warm, maybe -- but,
                           look, you don't even have a coat and
                           I still have to chop wood to make a
                           fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you
                           tell me if that's simple.

               
               The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flash drowsily to their own tempo.

               
                                      WAITRESS [re: the lights]
                            Why don't I try to get them to stop
                            blinking?

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, AN HOUR OR SO LATER

               She is visibly drained, after the day and the drinks.

               

                                     STARKS
                           They told me I joined the army when I
                           was seventeen. That's when my father
                           died and, before that, it was
                           apparently just me and him since I
                           was born 'cause my mom split.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           So you never knew your mother?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I guess not. But, as of now, I never
                           knew either.

               

                                                                              38.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           I'm sorry.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah. [Beat] How about you?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Never knew my father. I grew up with
                           my mother. Actually, I grew up around
                           my mother. She was great though. I
                           mean, the way she was with her
                           friends... She was this woman who had
                           so much life in her, she had to find
                           ways to kill some of it just to be
                           like the rest of us. [Beat] She died
                           young.

                                     STARKS
                           How?

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           She fucked herself up day after day
                           and then, one day, she fell asleep
                           with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I
                           came home from work and she was gone.

               
               The TEARS still run after all these years.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm sorry.

               

                                     WAITRESS
                           Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for
                           the last ten years.

               

                                     STARKS
                           That when you stopped being a nurse?

               
               She is surprised that he gleaned the connection -- and that he'd
               been listening so closely.

               
                                     WAITRESS [Exhausted]
                           Yeah, that's when I stopped being a
                           nurse. I never thought I could stop
                           being one, I wanted it for so long,
                           but... you just can't do it anymore
                           when you lose someone like that. You
                           can't take care of other people.

               
               She closes her eyes and finally passes out. STARKS watches
               her face, lit serenely by the FIRE and the Christmas lights.
               It bears her grief even in sleep.

               

                                                                              39.

               
               He covers her with a BLANKET then looks around and spots the
               only PERSONAL EFFECTS in the room on her mantle. He walks
               towards them, tripping slightly on a CORD from the LIGHTS. He
               stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall.

               
               As he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away
               from where his hand landed on the wall: HIS OWN DOG TAGS,
               given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a
               single NAIL tacked into the wall.

               
               Stunned, he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the
               metal. He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few
               PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother,
               JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to
               swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the
               situation.
               STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him
               figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER
               and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on
               his way to the PILE.

               
               The label on the first BILL reads "Jackie Price." On the
               second, the same. And the third...until at the bottom of the
               pile, STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on its
               DATE: December 3, 2004.

               
               STARKS is absolutely stunned.
               STARKS looks over at JACKIE and, just then, the HARSH SOUND
               of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and
               the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst moment. He
               is being taken out of the JACKET...

               It's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out...

               
               He winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across
               Starks' face. DR. GRIES checks his pulse and cleans his face
               as best as he can with a WET TOWEL.

               

                                      DR. GRIES
                            William, can you hear me?

               
               His VOICE echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it
               does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in
               Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the
               JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin.

               
               STARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in,
               afraid of what they've done to this man...

               

                                                                              40.

               

               INT. CADAVER DRAWER


               
               STARKS clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes. FIVE
               SECONDS OF TOTAL BLACKNESS and SILENCE and he's back in...

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' (JACKIE'S) APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               Only now, he's kneeling beside her sleeping FACE, just
               looking at it. STARKS doesn't know what's going on but her
               serene, sleeping face steadies him. He can only call out the
               name he thinks she might respond to...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Jackie? Jackie?

               
               Sure enough, she answers with a STIR in her sleep.

                                     JACKIE
                           Hm...

               
               We see, in STARKS' eyes, the unbelievable connection: she is
               the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992.

               
                                     STARKS [Swallowing, softly]
                           Jackie? [Beat] What year is it?

               
                                     JACKIE [In a drunken slumber]
                           What?

               

                                     STARKS
                           What year is it?

               
                                     JACKIE [Barely opening her eyes]

                           2004.

               
               STARKS looks around as JACKIE moves in her sleep, almost
               falling off the couch. STARKS picks her up and, in her sleep,
               she WRAPS her arms around his neck.

               

               INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               STARKS tenderly lays her down on the bed...

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               STARKS picks up his DOG TAGS from the console, looks around,
               spots the TELEVISION and fumbles a bit as he figures out how
               to turn it on. STARKS sits down, throws back the rest of
               JACKIE'S DRINK and another shot and looks around nervously,
               unable to explain what's happening to him...

               

                                                         FADE TO:

               

                                                                              41.

               

               INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING


               
               JACKIE sits in her sleep as she wakes up, clearly hung over.

               

               INT. BATHROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING


               
               As JACKIE closes the MEDICINE CABINET, she sees her hungover
               reflection in it.

               
               She puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore some
               color and life in her. As she comes up, that's when she
               remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in
               her sleep.

               
                                     STARKS [O.S., echoing distantly]
                           Jackie? [Beat] What year is it?
               She SHOOTS UP from the sink, staring at her reflection.

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, SECONDS LATER


               
               JACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper strewn
               all around him and the TV still on. He's holding the TAGS.

               
               She kneels down close to his face and stares at him for
               awhile before STARKS is jarred. He defensively GRABS HER
               WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN, startling her.

               
                                     JACKIE [Desperately]
                           Who are you?

               
               STARKS lets his GRIP loosen.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I'm William Starks.

               
               A short look of SHOCK cross her face before she leaps up.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Get the hell out of my house!

               
               JACKIE grabs the nearest object -- the IRON FORK from the
               FIREPLACE set -- and holds it, shaking, against STARKS. STARKS
               stays calm; he hardly expected a different reaction.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What'd you do? Snoop all over the
                           place? You had no right. You had no
                           right to go through anything.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense.
                           It doesn't even make sense to me.

               

                                                                            42.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           If you don't get out of my house
                           right now, I'll call the police.

               
                                      STARKS [Remembering]
                            Your mom was passed out on the side
                            of the road when I found you. Her
                            name was Jean. [Beat] She was dizzy
                            the whole time...

               
                                     JACKIE [Trembling]
                           Why would you do something like this?
                           I tried to help you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can
                           prove it.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What? Now you're gonna show me some
                           kind of driver's license?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No, I don't have anything to show
                           you. I'm here from a mental hospital.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Well, you belong in one.

               
                                      STARKS [Solemnly]
                            [Beat] You and your mom were in a
                            truck and she kept a rifle in the
                            back of it...

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Stop it! Stop it!
               JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her
               eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat]
                           but I'm not lying to you.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           You can't be William Starks. He's
                           dead.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] What?

               

                                                                              43.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've
                           been to his grave.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] What?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           His body was found New Year's Day,
                           19...1993. At Alpine...

               
                                     STARKS [Finishing for her]
                           Alpine Grove. That's the mental
                           hospital. How do you know that?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I looked it up.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How?

               
               Then he remembers -- understanding with a chill that what she
               is saying could entirely be true.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I gave you my dog tags.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           No, you didn't. They found William
                           Starks' body dead in the snow.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How'd he die?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I don't know. But he did die.
               STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through
               her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the
               apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table,
               lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then
               laughs nervously as she looks up.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I know what this is...I picked you up
                           when I was drunk and you probably
                           thought I'm just fucked up enough to
                           fall for this. But the thing is I
                           know what I'm doing when I drink. I
                           just usually don't care. Right now, I
                           do though. And I want you out. Now.

               

                                                                             44.

               

               

               

                                     STARKS
                           It's December 25th, 1993 today.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           No, it's not. [Beat] It's December
                           25th, 2004.

               
                                     STARKS [Desperate]
                           That can't be. That's...just, I
                           mean... You're telling me I died in
                           less than a week in the time I'm in.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I'm telling you I don't care what
                           time you think you're in. You're not
                           William Starks. [Beat] I don't
                           believe in many things, but I believe
                           in death. And it doesn't give back
                           what it takes. So whoever you are...I
                           did a nice thing, you've made me
                           regret it enough already, so please,
                           just leave.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'll leave. But look at me. Look at
                           my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met
                           you and your mother. I told you then
                           that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There
                           was no one for miles around so I know
                           you know there's no way I could have
                           known that from a pair of dog tags
                           you had lying around.

               

                                       JACKIE
                           Please...

               
               STARKS looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave.
               JACKIE, a little calmer, looks at the door like he's still on
               the other side of it and calls out softly, and sadly...

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Happy Birthday.

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               STARKS looks around him and, we see, from bottom up, the
               exterior around Jackie's house melt away as STARKS suddenly
               faces the massacred village in Iraq. Shocked at what's
               happening to his body, he looks up, petrified. His body is
               wound as tightly as a knot.

               

                                                                              45.

               

               EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT, 1991


               
               Again, we're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN
               NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images.

               
               Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER -- seething in
               anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY, presumably
               belonging to the MAN not five feet away. Next to Starks is an
               angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY, ordering STARKS to follow him. STARKS
               is watching himself in the scene.

               

                                     MEDLEY
                           You walk on. They pick up their guns
                           and fire at you, you stay. They pick
                           up and fire at each other, and you
                           walk on!

                                     STARKS
                           He's got his gun pointed at a kid.

               

                                     MEDLEY
                           That is not our problem.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah, well, none of this is our
                           fuckin' problem.

               
               STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER
               threatening to shoot a child. We hear him YELLING in Arabic.

               
               What STARKS doesn't see is another IRAQI SOLDIER (2) aiming
               his GUN at STARKS.

               

                                     MEDLEY
                           We are leaving this site right now.

               
               STARKS doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim.

               
                                      STARKS [To the first Iraqi soldier]
                            Hey!

               
               At the force of the word, the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the
               LITTLE BOY flees.

               
               STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun
               slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER. Neither speaks the
               other's language but they're both saying everything with
               their eyes. Neither moves his off the other.

               
               Just then, though, we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a
               clear aim at STARKS.

               

                                                                             46.

               
               He takes his SHOT before anyone else does. STARKS goes down
               as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off.

               
               He falls to the ground. As the rest of the picture fades to
               black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still
               haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to the

               CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER.

               
               And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the
               drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended...

               

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

               

               INT. MORGUE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY


               
               DR. GRIES, DR. BECKER, DAMON and NURSE HARDING enter the
               room.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You left him in all night?

               

                                     NURSE HARDING
                           Shit, he's probably dead.

               
                                     DR. GRIES [Defensively]
                           I tried to ask you if we should leave
                           him in yesterday...

               

                                     BECKER
                           Don't get all worked up, Justin. I
                           expected some common sense on your
                           part and clearly I was expecting too
                           much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           We never should have done this to
                           him...

               

                                     BECKER
                           Well, what are we gonna do about it now?

               
               Nothing is Gries' answer. Still, Becker seems to share the
               concern.

               
               BECKER motions for them to open the drawer. They pull him
               out. STARKS looks cold and wrecked.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead?

               
               BECKER feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one.

               

                                                                              47.

               

                                     BECKER
                           No. [To Harding and Damon] Get him
                           upstairs.

               

               INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY


               
               DR. LORENSON walks into the ward to check on STARKS. The
               attending NURSE is walking around the ward.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Where's William Starks.

               

                                     NURSE
                           I'm not sure. Dr. Becker had him
                           moved.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               DR. LORENSON walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital,
               peering into every room, looking for Starks.

               

               INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               DR. LORENSON spots BECKER walking out the DOORS of the
               hospital and RUNS after him, in only his white coat...

               

               EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, DAY (CONT'D)


               
                                     LORENSON [Calling out after him]
                           Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait!

               
               DR. BECKER stops walking and waits a moment, registering the
               voice, before he turns around to face Dr. Lorenson.

               
                                     LORENSON [Out of breath]
                           Where's William Starks?

                                     BECKER
                           He's recovering on the third floor.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Are you kidding me? He's not
                           psychotic!

               

                                     BECKER
                           Then how would you describe him,
                           Beth? Merely rebellious?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom.
                           His behavior's hardly suggested he
                           needed neuroleptics.

               

                                                                            48.

               

                                     BECKER
                           And you know that from what, a couple
                           two-minute stares across a room?

               
                                     LORENSON [Firmly]
                           He didn't need anti-psychotics, if
                           that's even all you're giving him...?

               
               BECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his
               CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the
               BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him.

               
                                      BECKER [Steadily]
                            After he slashed me with a hospital
                            instrument, I determined, in my
                            professional opinion, that Mr.
                            Starks, needed a little placating.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           [Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked?

               

                                     BECKER
                           You sure you want to begin making
                           that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I
                           took five stitches during a routine
                           therapy session.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I'm sure he took some, too.

               
                                     BECKER [Smirking, unphased]
                           Happens sometimes when you've got to
                           restrain them. You watch the rest of
                           us work. You know that.

               
                                     LORENSON [Appealing to him]
                           Our patients are sick.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Yes, they are.

               
               LORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           He's not gonna end up like Casey,
                           Tom. Whatever happened to him is not
                           going to "happen" to Starks. I don't
                           know what you're trying to do here
                           ...but he's not a lab animal, Tom.
                           You can't reprogram him no matter the
                           drugs or the treatment.

               

                                                                             49.

               

                                      BECKER
                            Jesus, you really don't let up, do
                            you? Just because you failed your
                            patient doesn't necessarily mean the
                            rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to
                            tarnish your war hero's image, but he
                            is psychotic.

               
               LORENSON looks back, starting to grasp Becker's misshapen
               beliefs.

               

                                      BECKER
                            Now, if you'll excuse me, it's
                            Christmas, and I have a family I'd
                            like to see.

               

               INT. ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY


               
               STARKS, IV in arm, lies asleep in bed, recovering...

               

               INT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT


               
               JACKIE walks in a hospital -- with many aspects parallel to
               the mental hospital. White on white and, for Jackie
               particularly, the presence of painful memories.

               

               INT. ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY


               
               LORENSON walks closer to STARKS and carefully examines the
               BRUISES and BURNS on a body that's been badly beaten. His
               eyes bear his guilt.

               JACKIE waits until a nurse, CLAIRE, greets her perfunctorily.

               
                                      CLAIRE [Not looking up]
                            How can I help you?

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Hi, Claire.

               
               CLAIRE looks up, astonished to see her. She smiles warmly.

               

                                     CLAIRE
                           Jackie, hi. How are you, honey?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I'm ok. [Beat] I need a favor.

               

                                                         CUT TO:

               

                                                                              50.

               

               INT. STARKS' HOSPITAL ROOM


               
               STARKS is asleep when a DARK FIGURE walks, like a GHOST, past
               the WINDOWED DOOR of his room. STARKS opens his eyes and
               snaps his neck in its direction -- fearful of everything at
               this point. When he looks, there's nothing there; he's not
               sure there ever was. The room starts to blue as he looks
               around it, not knowing if he is crazy...

               

                                                           RETURN TO:

               

               INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, VERMONT


               
               JACKIE peruses HEADLINES and ABSTRACTS pulled up on the web:

               
                   "ALPINE GROVE INVESTIGATION into the mysterious death of
                   William Starks..."

               
                   "The body of WILLIAM STARKS, the former war hero who was
                   charged with the murder of OFFICER EDWARD HARRISON, was
                   found on the grounds of ALPINE GROVE on January 1, 1993.
                   STARKS was believed to have died from a wound to the
                   head."

               
               The words and PHRASES that confirm Starks' story RISE from
               their couched places on the computer screen.

               
                   "Local Doctor charged with medical malpractice." "Dr.
                   Thomas Becker resigns..." "It involved the recreation of
                   a womb-like environment." "Former patients testify to
                   being put in instrument known as the 'Jacket'"...
                   "Patient Rudy MacKenzie testifies..."

               
                    "WILLIAM STARKS, laurelled war hero..."

               
               As JACKIE keeps scrolling, her face wears her disbelief that
               what STARKS was saying may have been true. Then, she sees,
               archived in a state newspaper, a mention of Dr. Lorenson and
               a particular patient, "Eugene Yazdi."

               
                   "Local Boy, Eugene Yazdi, Overcomes Absence Seizure
                   Syndrome to Win Mathematic Decathlon...with the aid of
                   Local Doctor, Dr. Loel Lorenson." "Panelists for
                   National Epilepsy Conference include Dr. Lorenson,
                   Alpine Grove Hospital."

               

               INT. STARKS' HOSPITAL ROOM, DECEMBER 26TH


               
               A NURSE is checking on STARKS as he slowly wakes up.

               

                                      STARKS
                            What the hell kind of drugs are you
                            people giving me?

               

                                                                              51.

               
               STARKS is asking the NURSE, but it's BECKER's voice that
               answers though Starks can't see him.

               

                                      BECKER [O.S.]
                            Just something to help you sleep.

               
               STARKS panics when he hears the voice. He looks around
               nervously but the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT pouring into the room is
               blinding. He swallows as he looks at the NURSE'S FACE as she
               continues adjusting his pillows.

               
                                      STARKS [Swallowing nervously]
                            Did you say something?

               
               The NURSE shakes her head lightly and just then BECKER steps
               out of the LIGHT.

                                      BECKER
                            I said the drugs were to help you
                            sleep. [Beat] Did you sleep well?

               
               Becker is remarkably calm, further confusing Starks' sense of
               reality.

               
                                      STARKS [Doubtfully]
                            But I wasn't asleep. Was I?

               

                                      BECKER
                            Yes. You were. You were asleep for
                            nearly a whole day. It's December
                            26th, William.

               
               STARKS sits up groggily, remembering what happened to him and
               wondering how much, if any of it, was real.

               

                                     STARKS
                           It's December 26th?

               
               STARKS examines himself -- looking at his arms, spotting the
               BRUISES on them.

               

                                      BECKER
                            That's right, William.

               
                                      STARKS [Slowly figuring it out]

                            1992?

               
               BECKER nods. STARKS sits up -- his predicament and the room
               slowly coming into focus.

               

                                                                              52.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Yes. [Caustically] And that's the sun
                           and you're on earth. [Beat] And I
                           know you know better.

               
               STARKS begins to piece if together. BECKER, as we begin to
               see, is right. It is 1992 in Alpine Grove.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know better. All I know is
                           that you left me in there.

               

                                       BECKER
                           In where?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Uncertainly] In that thing...the
                           Jacket.

               
               The NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting Starks
               really is delusional. Becker doesn't even flinch as STARKS
               tries to get a better look at Becker's face.

               

                                     BECKER
                           We were forced to use restrains if
                           that's what you're referring to.

               

                                     STARKS
                           That wasn't a fucking restraint.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Actually, that's exactly what our
                           equipment is.

               
               STARKS' EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the I.V.
               in his arm, lingering on it long enough that Starks braces
               himself for an ATTACK of some sort. But Becker just looks
               back innocently as he adjusts it.

               

                                       BECKER
                           Relax.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Don't act like I don't know what's
                           real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's
                           crazy here.

               

                                     BECKER
                           [Pointedly] Of course you're not.

               
               Then he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it.

               

                                                                              53.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You're just suffering from delusions
                           that are unfortunately part of your
                           condition.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Don't give me that. I know what's
                           real, goddamnit! You strapped me in
                           something and stuck me in a drawer.

               
               BECKER nods diagnostically. The NURSE's nonchalance about it
               as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I didn't dream it. I may have been
                           asleep but it wasn't a dream.
               BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I had a patient a few years ago. His
                           name was Ted Casey...

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't give a shit about your
                           patient!

               

                                     BECKER
                           I wasn't pausing to see if you did.
                           [Beat] But, incidentally, you should,
                           because you're birds of a feather.

               
               STARKS squints as he searches out Becker's face.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year
                           old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me
                           to have a look at him because, after
                           his deeds were done... he climbed
                           into the trees of the forest where he
                           killed her and woofed like a dog. He
                           couldn't even remember his name when
                           I spoke to him, but, curiously
                           enough, he could speak back. [Beat]
                           Ted never went to prison because
                           everyone -- including me -- was
                           convinced he was sick. So he came
                           here.

               
               BECKER leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening.
               STARKS is.

               

                                                                           54.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Then one day a little girl came with
                           her mother to visit a relative and I
                           caught Ted stealing looks at her --
                           the kind you really have to steal if
                           you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked
                           Ted then if he could remember what
                           the little girl who he had... slain
                           ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a
                           look I'll never forget, and, when he
                           answered, it wasn't with a color or
                           any sort of physical description I'd
                           expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember
                           it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those
                           were actually his last words I think.

               
               BECKER's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and
               remorse as he recounts Ted's tale.

               

                                     STARKS
                           We are not birds of a feather.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think
                           you're in a tree... woofing like a
                           dog. And I'm just trying to help you
                           the only way I can think of.

               
               BECKER gets up and, as he moves out of the light, STARKS sees
               his BANDAGED CHEEK, reinforcing his memory of what
               happened...

               
                                     STARKS [Provokingly]
                           What happened to your cheek, Dr.
                           Becker?

               

                                     BECKER
                           I was careless. Happens sometimes.

               

                                                        FADE TO:

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992


               
               STARKS looks out on the SNOW-COVERED GROUNDS from his room on
               the third floor. He seems pacified for the moment.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               Everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad
               mechanics of managing madness. CATATONIC PATIENTS and dated
               equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a NURSE who walks
               among them, we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and GLAZED
               EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them.

               

                                                                                55.

               
               His ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as she
               passes. STARKS has successfully made it out of his room. She
               turns one corner as STARKS hustles to turn another...

               

               INT. DAY ROOM, ALPINE GROVE


               
               STARKS is almost   there. As RANDOM ORDERLIES pass him, STARKS
               lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head
               down so low they   can't see his face. They pass, and STARKS
               starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside.

               
               As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with
               only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally, like
               he no longer remembers the risks. Instead he remembers what
               Jackie told him.

               

                                     JACKIE [O.S.]
                           They found William Starks' body dead
                           in the snow.

               

                                     STARKS [O.S.]
                           How'd he die?

               

                                     JACKIE [O.S.]
                           I don't know. But he did die.

               

               EXT. GROUNDS, ALPINE GROVE


               
               STARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and
               lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs
               to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's
               VOICE takes him by surprise.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Hey. You're not supposed to be out
                           here.
               STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where
               his body was found. The terrible question asks itself on his
               face: Is this when Starks is killed?

               
                                     STARKS [Turning around sharply]
                           What are you going to do to me?

               

                                       LORENSON
                           Well...

               
               As LORENSON reaches into his POCKET for something, STARKS
               anxiously holds his breath. It's BLACK when it comes out and...
               a SKI HAT when it opens up. STARKS lets out his breath,
               relieved.

               

                                                                           56.

               
                                     LORENSON [Nonchalantly]
                           I thought I'd just ask you to come
                           back inside with me.

               

                                     STARKS
                           And if I didn't want to come?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I guess I'd ask you why.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Because I don't think I'm crazy.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You're not crazy.

               
               STARKS is surprised by Lorenson's agreement.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You suffer from delusional disorder.
                           That doesn't mean you're... crazy. It
                           just means you're confused. And
                           you're here, instead of in jail,
                           because that was determined to have
                           played a role in your killing of a
                           police officer.

               
                                     STARKS [Correcting him]
                           Alleged killing of a police officer.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You were convicted of the crime.

               

                                     STARKS
                           That conviction doesn't convince me
                           of anything. Until I know that I did
                           it, I'm not going to accept that I
                           did.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You may never remember at all. [Beat]
                           Your mind's grasp of reality and the
                           real events that have happened to you
                           has been damaged.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. The real events that have
                           happened to me have been fucked up.
                           Not my mind.

               
               LORENSON seems to realize -- at least for an instant -- that he
               is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and
               cogently, staring back at him.

               

                                                                              57.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           [Beat] William, I'd like to ask you
                           something if I can.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Since when do people around here have
                           to ask permission to do anything?

               
                                     LORENSON [Suspiciously]
                           How's your treatment progressing with
                           Dr. Becker?

               
               STARKS still doesn't know how much Lorenson knows, and if he
               should trust him.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Fine. [Beat] Why made you ask?

               
               LORENSON answers first with his eyes looking over Starks'
               body. STARKS merely stares back tersely.

               
                                      LORENSON [Carefully]
                            I just hope you'd let me know if that
                            wasn't the case.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Why, what would you do?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I could try to...make it stop.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. I don't want it to.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           So it's helping?
                                     STARKS [Choosing his words carefully]
                           [Beat] It's making me feel like a
                           different person.

               
               LORENSON -- sensing she's not going to get any more from
               Starks -- turns around to go back inside. It's only as she
               turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous she
               is. But you'd never guess it from her tone...

               
                                      LORENSON [Casually]
                            You comin'?

               
               STARKS looks towards the FENCES locking him in from every
               direction. LORENSON waits until she hears STARKS' FOOTSTEPS
               following her. She waits until STARKS has reached her.

               

                                                                      58.

               

                                      LORENSON
                            You should be careful. You could be
                            killed if they found you out here.

               

                                      STARKS
                            Believe me, I know.

               

               INT. PATIENT CAFETERIA, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, 1992


               
               STARKS and MACKENZIE are eating opposite each other.

               

                                      STARKS
                            What were you talking about the other
                            day?

               

                                      MACKENZIE
                            I wasn't talking about anything.

               

                                      STARKS
                            Yeah, you were. What you said about
                            them taking me out to the woods...

               
               MACKENZIE clams up slightly at the mention of it...

               

                                      STARKS
                            What do you know about the Jacket?

               
               MACKENZIE's eyes start to twitch nervously.

               

                                      MACKENZIE
                            I know you need one when it's really
                            cold.

               

                                      STARKS
                            [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me.
                            Listen. I'm going to die.

                                      MACKENZIE
                            Mortality's actually a great thing to
                            be familiar with. It means you're
                            sane on some level.

               

                                      STARKS
                            [Gravely] No, I mean in four days,
                            I'm supposed to die.

               

                                      MACKENZIE
                            [Beat] How do you know?

               

                                      STARKS
                            The Jacket.

               

                                                                              59.

               
               MACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention
               of it.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Oh no, you're pretty young. Your
                           body'll be able to handle a lot more
                           of it than you think...

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I
                           was in it that my body's gonna be
                           found in four days.

               
               Just then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in
               her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks
               towards them.

                                     HARDING
                           What are you two yappin' about?

               
               STARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict
               a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every
               object could be a threat to his life as this point.

               
                                     MACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut]
                           [Beat] We're talking about our
                           ability to go forward in time, to go
                           into the future. [To Starks] That is
                           what we're talking about here, right?

               
               STARKS is startled MacKenzie gets it.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah, it is.

               

                                     HARDING
                           You know something? You're two
                           fucking freaks is what you are.

               
                                     STARKS [Smiling]
                           Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you
                           think we're doing in this place?

               
               MACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out.

               

                                     HARDING
                           I want the two of you to shut the
                           fuck up and eat your food.

               
               HARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns.

               
                                     STARKS [Under his breath]
                           I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie.

               

                                                                              60.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           It's gonna be sticky.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Why?

               
               MACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in
               its sudden jerks accompanying every word.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it
                           now. When she started getting
                           suspicious about me was when they
                           stopped using it on me. Women!

               

                                     STARKS
                           So what am I supposed to do?

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           You could still always give Becker an
                           itch. 'Course you might get killed
                           when he goes to scratch it, but seems
                           to me you're saying that's about to
                           happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful
                           not to walk yourself right into
                           something.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY


               
               Dr. LORENSON and DR. GRIES are walking briskly to a meeting.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           We're late.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I wish they'd skip the formality of
                           this annual review and just cut our
                           budget. Our silence on the matter
                           should be enough to appease the civic
                           conscience without wasting an hour we
                           don't have.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Maybe it's not such a waste.

               
               LORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record
               straight.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           It's the ticking of a box on a sheet
                           of paper no one cares about.

               

                                                                             61.

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           They don't care about all the things
                           we do right. [Beat] But they might
                           ...they might care about what we're
                           doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they
                           should come here to look for.

               
               LORENSON can see GRIES is trying to tell her something.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           What should they be looking for?

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           They should just be looking harder.

               
               LORENSON grabs GRIES' arm, sensing the import of her words.

                                     LORENSON
                           Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it?
                           He's doing stuff, isn't he?

               

                                     DR. GRIES
                           Later. I'll tell you about it later.
                           We got a session to catch now.

               

               INT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY


               
               STARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more
               threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around --
               presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS
               humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it
               comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,
               fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,
               administering medication from a dated CART.

               
               STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS
               or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused
               on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.

               
               The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards
               the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up
               speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as
               the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.

               
               He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She
               starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up
               the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.

               
               The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his
               balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he
               understands pain.

               

                                                                             62.

               
                                      STARKS [To Sally]
                            You ok?

               
               As she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike
               him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the
               BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS
               he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes
               perilously close to STARKS' head.

               
               The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.
               Is this when he dies?

               
               The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time.
               STARKS gets him by the NECK, expertly applying PRESSURE
               POINTS and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. STARKS
               himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. He lets
               out a suspended BREATH, instinctively touching his FOREHEAD
               to make sure he's not cut. He looks back at SALLY.

               

                                     SALLY
                           Are you ok?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone?
                           Where is everyone?

               
                                     SALLY [Defensively]
                           There's a state rep visiting so
                           they've moved everyone around. But
                           I've been alone before...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Where are the other orderlies?

               

                                     SALLY
                           In the therapy session downstairs.
                           That's what the rep's sitting in
                           on...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Ok, listen. I want you to get out of
                           here and lock the door behind you.
                           I'll go get some doctors.

               
               SALLY looks at STARKS, wondering whether she can trust him.
               Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers
               that she can.

               

                                                                              63.

               

               INT. MAIN ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992


               
               The STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is
               recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF
               (Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are
               presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters...

               
                                      STARKS [Calling out]
                            Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker.

               
               BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response.

               

                                      BECKER
                            Mr. Starks, this session is for our
                            civil patients. Damon, please take
                            Mr. Starks back to his ward.
               STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.

               
                                      STARKS [Derisively]
                            No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap
                            me in a Jacket or even gag me, but
                            please don't leave me out of therapy.
                            This is where I feel like I make the
                            most progress.

               
               BECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an
               AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less.

               

                                      BECKER
                            Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a
                            chair for yourself.

               
               As STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as
               they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically
               ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the
               group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have
               the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down.

               

                                      BECKER
                            Mr. Jensen, please continue.

               
               JENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group
               seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's
               about to...

               

                                      JENSEN
                            Well, [beat] I've been approached by
                            the Federal Trade Organization.

               
               BECKER's not listening to a word JENSEN says. But STARKS is.

               

                                                                           64.

               
                                     BECKER [Calm as ever]
                           And what have they approached you
                           about, Mr. Jensen?

               

                                     JENSEN
                           They want me to head the Organization
                           for the Organized.

               
               The other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE REP
               listens limply.

               

                                     BECKER
                           The Organization...for the Organized?

               

                                     JENSEN
                           That's right. Have you heard of them?

                                     BECKER
                           No, Mr. Jensen. I have not.

                           That's because there is no such
                           Organization, you idiot.

                           That is categorically not true. Bl-bl-
                           blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE.
                           I've been asked to lead them. But, if
                           you'd heard of them, then they
                           wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?

               
                                      BECKER [Wearily]
                            What do the rest of you think?

               
               The GROUP stares at one another silently.

               
                                      STARKS [Loud and emphatic]
                            Well, [beat] I know they exist.

               

                                     BECKER
                           And how is that?

               
               STARKS looks at JENSEN, who looks back avidly. MACKENZIE eyes
               Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do.

               

                                     STARKS
                           When I was in the Gulf, the
                           Organization was recruiting the
                           Organized.

               

                                                                             65.

               
                                     BECKER [Incensed]
                           Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because
                           if it's not, it doesn't help Mr.
                           Jensen.

               
                                      STARKS [Looking right at Jensen]
                            It is a fact. Bona fide, and
                            classified.

               
               LORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously.

               

                                     JENSEN
                           I knew it! I knew it! Those little
                           fuckers are everywhere.

               

                                     STARKS
                           They recruit only the best, Mr.
                           Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have
                           to say this...

               
               Not even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence...

               

                                     STARKS
                           But these people [pointing to the
                           Doctors] know about it. In fact, when
                           Presidents of this country and heads
                           of state leave office, they come
                           here, to Alpine Grove. They're among
                           us right now! [Looking right at
                           Becker] Isn't that right, Dr.
                           Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they
                           picked you.

               
               JENSEN looks on nobly.

               

                                     STARKS
                           They're always ordering us to stay
                           calm, but how can we be calm?

               
               STARKS suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message
               to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Looking suddenly directly at Becker]
                           All they do is give orders. That's
                           all they have to do. And no one will
                           ever know. All it comes down to is an
                           order. [Beat] They've got hands
                           everywhere.

               
               STARKS stands up, ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen. The OBSERVERS
               look to BECKER for order.

               

                                                                              66.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Long live the Organization for the
                           Organized!

               

                                     BECKER
                           Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr.
                           Starks!

               
               But, at that, Jensen's completely lost it. His excitement
               erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and
               eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF in the head.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Sit down, Mr. Jensen!

               
               Too late. OTHER PATIENTS are on their feet, HANDS jubilantly
               up in the air. And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless
               order is soundly delivered in Becker's NOD to Damon.

               

                                     RANDOM PATIENTS
                           Dr. Thatcher! Dr. Becker!

               
               DAMON and HARDING grab STARKS while the other members of the
               STAFF slowly calm the other patients. LORENSON is too busy to
               notice them taking Starks out. STARKS winks at MACKENZIE, who
               smiles somewhat sadly back.

               

                                                        CUT TO:

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992


               
               HARDING and DAMON stand above Starks, who lies on the brutal
               slab, already hemmed in the Jacket.

               

                                     DAMON
                           Starks, you're like a mule. You're
                           real stubborn. But there's ways of
                           fixin' that. All you need is a good
                           stick. [Beat] Here's your stick.

               
               DAMON slams him in the drawer.

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               STARKS' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in
               there with him. The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of
               nowhere, a DROP falls on his eye. PING! STARKS winces. He
               clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall.
               His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by
               the DRIPS -- making a score fit only for hell. He closes his
               eyes and begins to die...

               

                                                                              67.

               

               EXT. CRIME SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK, 1992


               
               STARKS and TENNY -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in
               silence in TENNY'S CAR. (We recognize the murder scene.) RED
               POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS
               doesn't see them yet.

               
               STARKS and TENNY are talking to one another. TENNY's voice
               takes a dangerous tone.

               

                                     TENNY
                           You ever been to jail?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No.

               
               TENNY nods, distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand
               down his leg to the GUN he's hidden there.

               

                                     TENNY
                           It's worse than war. It's worse than
                           anywhere you've ever been.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think
                           prison's so bad you don't want to
                           remember it...

               
               TENNY carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured
               and cautious with each word, each move.

               

                                     TENNY
                           Well, I've never been to war, but I'm
                           sure as hell not going back to
                           prison.

               
                                      STARKS [Finally spotting Harrison]
                            What's he pulling us over for?

               
                                     TENNY [Still preparing himself]
                           Recreation.

               
               OFFICER HARRISON walks up to their car.

               

                                     OFFICER HARRISON
                           Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step
                           out of the car, with your hands at
                           your side please.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Why?

               

                                                                              68.

               
                                     OFFICER HARRISON [Sternly]
                           Step out of the car.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Ok, sir. I was just asking what for.

               

                                     OFFICER HARRISON
                           This is a stolen vehicle you're
                           driving. Now put your hands in the
                           air, out where I can see 'em.

               
               That's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S
               HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation
               explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON
               goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of
               the car to check on him.

                                     STARKS
                           Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?

               
               TENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows,
               assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as
               he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in
               hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS.

               

                                     TENNY
                           Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you
                           ain't even worth a fucking bullet.

               
               TENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and
               shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER
               HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES

               THE HIT.

               
               STARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue
               anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in
               his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of
               the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET...

               
               STARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out,
               looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground, as he did in the
               scene before.

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               STARKS stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter
               as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's
               back in there. Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN'S FOREHEAD
               that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the LIGHT
               gradually dims...

               

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2004


               
               STARKS enters the diner, calming down even more as he spots
               JACKIE. She looks up, holding PLATES in her hand. She's
               understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she
               sees him. She greets him with a small smile.

               
               She drops off her orders and then walks up to him.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I'll be off in 15 minutes. Can you
                           wait till then?

               

               EXT. RAVINE, VERMONT, DAY, 2004


               
               STARKS and JACKIE smoke in the cold, standing next to the
               hood of her car.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           The Jacket. That's what they call it,
                           right?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yeah.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           It was banned, you know... and it led
                           to an investigation of Dr. Becker's
                           mistreatment of some of his patients.
                           That's when they found out how badly
                           he was drugging his patients...

               
                                      STARKS [Starting to make sense]
                            So he was giving me all kinds of
                            drugs...

               
                                     JACKIE [Nodding]
                           Apparently. He was taking a lot of
                           them, too. It said he was trying out
                           behavior modification treatments that
                           were banned back in the 70s -- "womb
                           treatment" is the name he gave to
                           what he did to you...

               
                                      STARKS [Cutting in]
                            Womb? A fuckin' womb? What kind of
                            animal did he come out of?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           But no one knew until after...

               

                                     STARKS
                           After I...

               

                                                                           70.

               
               JACKIE nods.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              [Beat] You bled to death.

               

                                        STARKS
                              What?

               

                                        JACKIE
                              I don't know how you got the cut to
                              your head, but you died bleeding from
                              it.

               
                                        STARKS [Digesting]
                              And you're sure my body was found on
                              January 1st?
               JACKIE nods.

               

                                        STARKS
                              Do you really believe me?

               

                                        JACKIE
                              I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was
                              crazy after you left that day. I died.
                              I still think I could be crazy. But
                              then I replayed that night in my head --
                              the parts of it I could remember --
                              and it was like...I don't care if I
                              was, or am. I haven't felt that way
                              in a room with someone my whole life.
                              [Beat] And when you left, all I
                              wanted was...

               
               JACKIE looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety
               is obvious. STARKS takes hold of her and holds her face close
               to his so that their foreheads touch.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              [Softly] I want to trust you. Should
                              I trust you?

               

                                        STARKS
                              Yes.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              Then we need to figure out what
                              happened to you. It's the only thing
                              we can do.

               

                                        STARKS
                              I know.

               

                                                                           71.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Alpine Grove still exists. I looked
                           it up on the net. We should go there
                           and see if there's still anyone
                           around who might have known what
                           happened to you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           If they don't take me out before
                           then. [As an afterthought] What's the
                           net?

               
               JACKIE looks at him and laughs.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY


               
               They are driving through VERMONT to ALPINE GROVE. STARKS
               looks out the window and watches her drive.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I didn't kill Officer Harrison.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I know.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How? Did they figure it out after I
                           died?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           No. They never figured it out. I did.
                           Most murderers don't stop to help a
                           drunk woman and her little girl on
                           the side of the road. Not without
                           hurting them.

               

               INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               STARKS and JACKIE sit opposite DR. MORGAN, the current young
               face of the hospital. MORGAN has a boyish face and a matching
               gullibility.

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           I'm sorry I can't tell you more about
                           your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our
                           own medical examiners determined only
                           that he died from a blunt trauma to
                           the head but that was right around
                           the time the Alpine Grove's staff
                           changed and I'm afraid we didn't have
                           the best record system before then.

               

                                                                   72.

               

                                     STARKS
                           His body was found on January 1,
                           1993, but do you know if that was
                           long after he had died?

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew
                           more.

               

                                     STARKS
                           What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr.
                           Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr.
                           Gries, I think.

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at
                           the hospital. If she was here at the
                           time your father was, then I'm sure
                           she'd be of more help to you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with
                           Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away
                           three, four years ago.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Do you have any kind of forwarding
                           address for Dr. Becker?

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           Your father was here 12 years ago. I
                           doubt the hospital would have that,
                           if Dr. Becker is still even alive.
                           [Beat, a little suspiciously] Is
                           there a particular reason you need
                           to know how your father died?

               
               STARKS doesn't waver when he answers.

               

                                     STARKS
                           He was the only family I remember.

               
                                     DR. MORGAN [Nodding]
                           I'll see what I can find out about
                           Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson
                           will know something.

               

                                                                              73.

               

               INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 2004


               
               Dr. MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward. STARKS
               looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than
               it ever was in 1993.

               

               INT. RECEPTION AREA, LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               As they arrive outside Lorenson's office, MORGAN turns to
               them.

               

                                     DR. MORGAN
                           Let me just tell her we're here.

               
               DR. MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS' HAND as they
               wait. It's hardly more than a couple seconds when LORENSON
               appears in the doorway. She looks at STARKS curiously and the
               two share a very lengthy, intense STARE.

               
               DR. LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks
               suspiciously. For his part, STARKS doesn't look as unfamiliar
               with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Hello. I'm Beth Lorenson.

               
               She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks...

               
               STARKS hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand. There is
               something very eerie about the exchange. STARKS quickly lets
               go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE...

               

                                     LORENSON
                           And you are...?

               
               JACKIE looks back uncomfortably.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I'm just William's friend.

               
               LORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then calmly
               turns to Dr. Morgan.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I think we'll be fine from here.
                           Thanks, Stanley.

               

                                                                             74.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               LORENSON leans against her desk while STARKS and JACKIE sit
               in the chairs. As they talk, each seems cautious in his
               exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or doesn't
               know.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           My God you look exactly like him.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I never knew my father. Did you?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most
                           memorable patient.

                                     STARKS
                           Why?

               
               LORENSON considers her answer.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           At the end, he made me change my mind
                           about a lot of things.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You thought my father was crazy?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           No. I don't think he was crazy. He
                           needed help...but he wasn't crazy.
                           [Beat] Your father actually helped me
                           with a case of mine.

               
               LORENSON waits to see if STARKS knows what she is talking
               about.

               

                                     STARKS
                           What case?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I was working with a boy named
                           Eugene.

               
               STARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Who was Eugene?

               
                                     LORENSON [Peaked]
                           He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you
                           familiar with the case?

               

                                                                     75.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Just a little, when we were looking
                           up information about William's
                           father. How did he help?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           It's complicated, but [looking at
                           Starks] in a way, your father let me
                           know how I'd get through to him.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           How?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           He just said...that I'd shock Eugene
                           and then things would change for him.

                                     JACKIE
                           I don't understand.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I still don't either, even after all
                           these years.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Do you know how my father died?

               
                                     LORENSON [Unconvincingly]
                           I don't know how much I remember but
                           I seem to think it was from a... cut or
                           blow of some sort or another.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How'd he get it?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           [Beat] I don't know.

               

                                     STARKS
                           But Dr. Morgan said you were around
                           when my father was...

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a
                           lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know
                           more about your father's. [Sincerely]
                           I didn't know about everything that
                           went on here.

               
               LORENSON says it like she's hiding something.

               

                                                                           76.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Well, do you think Dr. Becker would
                           have any idea?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           How do you know about Dr. Becker?

               

                                     STARKS
                           My dad wrote some things down before
                           he died.

               
               LORENSON looks like she's suddenly remembering something.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           That's right. He did.

               
               STARKS looks at Lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what
               Lorenson is talking about.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           So maybe Dr. Becker would know.
                           [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the
                           statute of limitations has run out
                           for charging the hospital with any
                           liabilities.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Why would we do that?

               
               STARKS just stares at LORENSON, not knowing if he died by
               this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust...

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Because Becker resigned after the
                           charges brought against him by State
                           Patient Advocacy Groups.

                                     LORENSON
                           I see you've done your homework.
                           [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot
                           of changes since then. At the time,
                           we didn't have the...resources to
                           help our patients the way we needed
                           to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are
                           different.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I wouldn't be so sure. Like you said
                           about back then, you might not know
                           everything going on around here.

               
               DR. LORENSON looks right at STARKS.

               

                                                                              77.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           It's important for you to know who
                           your father was, isn't it?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Yeah, it is.

               
                                     LORENSON [Eerily]
                           It's almost as if your life depended
                           on it. Isn't it?

               

                                      STARKS
                           Exactly.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Well... [beat] let me know how your
                           search turns out.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] We will.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY


               
               STARKS and JACKIE walk briskly down it, away from Lorenson's
               office.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't believe a thing she just
                           said.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Me neither. Who was the boy she was
                           talking about, Eugene?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I have no idea.

                                     JACKIE
                           You think Lorenson kills you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Maybe. I don't know. Seems more
                           likely Becker does, but at the very
                           least she knows how I died.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Let's see if they have an address for
                           Becker. I also want to figure out
                           more about the kid you helped her
                           with.

               

                                      STARKS
                           Why?

               

                                                                              78.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              Because that's the part I believe is
                              true. You probably did help her
                              somehow with the boy and Eugene's
                              name did come up over and over again
                              on the abstracts I pulled.

               
               STARKS nods.

               

                                        STARKS
                              [Beat] There's one more thing I want
                              to see.

               

               INT. CORRIDOR [LEADING TO BASEMENT], ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               STARKS, determined, now leads JACKIE. As they reach the end
               of the hall, we see DAMON -- now in his 50s -- look after them
               curiously before he goes back to his work with a PATIENT.

               

               INT. BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               JACKIE watches STARKS ignore the "Authorized Personnel Only"
               SIGN as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               The morgue looks exactly as before.

               
               STARKS is momentarily jarred in the room. He looks to the
               wall on which the JACKET hung and sees only the BARE HOOKS
               that used to hold it up.

               

                                        STARKS
                              This was the room. They used to hang
                              the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie]
                              This is where it happened. This is
                              the room I'm actually in right now.

               
               JACKIE isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be
               convinced...

               

                                        STARKS
                              I can show you. It's probably in
                              there.

               
               STARKS walks to the CADAVER DRAWERS and rests his hands on
               the one they put him in. Then, with great difficulty --
               physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there is
               anything left.

               
               He pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.

               

                                                                             79.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...

               
               STARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the
               stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD --
               and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when
               he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were
                           the only things I could move. [Beat]
                           Dead bodies don't bleed. And they
                           certainly can't claw so hard they
                           dent metal.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE

               STARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE, when STARKS spots
               DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON
               stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously.

               

                                     DAMON
                           You folks ain't supposed to be down
                           here.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           We were just leaving.

               
               DAMON doesn't take his eyes off Starks.

               

                                     DAMON
                           Do I know you from somewhere?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You may have known my father, William
                           Starks.
               DAMON smiles, remembering...

               

                                     DAMON
                           That's right! Goddamn, you're the
                           spitting image. I didn't know he had
                           a son.

               

                                     STARKS
                           He didn't either.

               
                                     DAMON [With a dirty laugh]
                           I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when
                           he had you. [Beat] You could be his
                           ghost.

               

                                                                           80.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Did you know my father?

               

                                     DAMON
                           Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop,
                           right?

               
               STARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You wouldn't happen to know how he
                           died, would you?

               
                                     DAMON [Slightly apprehensive]
                           No, I don't. I just remember them
                           finding his body.

                                     STARKS
                           You don't know any more, Damon?

               
                                     DAMON [Shocked]
                           How'd you know my name?

               

                                     STARKS
                           My father used to talk about you.

               

                                     DAMON
                           Oh yeah, what'd he say?

               
               Damon's eyes betray his unease.

               

                                     STARKS
                           He said you were a sadistic fuck that
                           belonged in jail.

               
               DAMON is shocked, and cowed. So much that he shakes as he
               looks for his bearings.

               

                                     DAMON
                           Look here, I don't like you getting
                           in my face and saying this bullshit
                           to me...

               

                                     STARKS
                           That's too bad.

               

                                     DAMON
                           I thought you said you never knew
                           your father.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I didn't. [Beat] Did you have
                           anything to do with his death?

               

                                                                              81.

               

                                     DAMON
                           I don't know what you're talking
                           about, man. I swear. This is some
                           weird shit you're telling me... and I
                           don't know how come you're doing it.

               
               STARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and
               distraught before him.

               

                                     STARKS
                           He died because he bled to death from
                           a blow to his head. Someone had to
                           have given him it.

               

                                     DAMON
                           I never touched your father! I swear!
               Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven
               FEAR. STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he remembers...

               

                                     STARKS
                           You know something, Damon? You're
                           like a mule. You're real stubborn.
                           But there's ways of fixin' that. All
                           you need is a good stick. [Beat]
                           Here's your stick. Live with it.

               
               STARKS looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against
               the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away.

               

               EXT. CEMETERY, ALPINE GROVE GROUNDS, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS,
               December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that
               of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE
               comes up behind him.

                                     JACKIE
                           How long do we have?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           They told me Becker's in Shelbourne
                           now. I looked him up and he was
                           listed.

               
               STARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to
               him. And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How far away is that?

               

                              82.

               JACKIE kisses his SCARS -- from the war and the Jacket -- and
               STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make
               love for the first time.

               

               INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               JACKIE is lying in STARKS' arms, running her FINGERS over one
               of the SCARS on his chest. STARKS strokes her hair.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What about Captain Medley? He never
                           told them what happened to you over
                           there. His testimony...that coward
                           wanted them to think you were crazy.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase
                           my sanity and you erase anything I'll
                           ever say.

               
                                     JACKIE [Frustrated]
                           Well, doesn't what he did to you make
                           you mad?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Of course it makes me mad. It makes
                           me more than mad. Just like
                           remembering the face of the man who
                           killed that officer and knowing
                           nothing more about him. But what's it
                           gonna do for me to find them now? I
                           can't fix everything in three days.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           You've got to get yourself out of
                           that place. They're going to kill you
                           if you don't.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I might not be able to.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           It's not a prison, it's a hospital.
                           There's got to be some way out of
                           there and you've got to find it...

               
               She doesn't finish because it's too hard to. STARKS nods,
               wiping her tears and kissing her.

               

                                                         FADE TO:

               INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 2004


               
               The sore sound of the DRAWER being opened stirs Jackie --
               awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep. She reaches
               across the bed, but STARKS is no longer there. She runs her
               hands over the bed like he's alive in the sheets.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992


               
               DR. LORENSON is administering medicine to a patient in the
               ward, when she sees -- almost like a shadow -- a STRETCHER
               being wheeled down the hall. She finishes with the patient
               and runs to the end of the hall in search of it...

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992


               
               STARKS lies recovering under a small light above his hospital
               bed. His body bears marks of the brutalization. As we pull
               back, we see DR. LORENSON standing guard over him at the foot
               of his bed.

               

               EXT. WARD, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, NEXT MORNING


               
               STARKS sits by a window -- I.V.'s in his arm -- smoking feebly,
               still severely weak from the Jacket, while DR. LORENSON
               observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You'll die if you keep smoking those
                           in your condition.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'll die either way.

               
               LORENSON pulls up a chair and sits opposite him.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I can't try to help you unless you
                           let me. [Beat] I know about the
                           Jacket.

               
               STARKS waits to see what this means.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I'm sorry for what you were put
                           through, and I'm sorry I couldn't
                           stop it earlier. But I promise you
                           that I will from now on...

               
                                      STARKS [Cutting him off]
                            I don't want you to.

               
               LORENSON doesn't understand.

               

                                                                           85.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           What do you mean?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You have no idea what's going on.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           No, I do. That's what I'm saying to
                           you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket
                           is my only chance in this place.

               
               LORENSON just thinks it's another delusion.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           How can you say that in your physical
                           condition? Do you realize that it's
                           because you were put in it that
                           you're as...weak as you are now?
                           Becker's a man who's not well
                           himself.

               
               STARKS searches for words that won't sound as crazy as he
               knows he appears. They don't exist.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You don't understand.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Then help me understand. You know,
                           you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets
                           have begun to experience curious
                           symptoms. What you have might well be
                           a syndrome and, if so, it's not one
                           we know enough about to be treating
                           it this vigorously.

               

                                     STARKS
                           This has nothing to do with that.

               
                                     LORENSON [Exasperated]
                           Then what? What? [Beat] I can't guess
                           it. You have to help me.

               
               STARKS fixes his eyes on Lorenson. He has nothing to lose but
               still he treads carefully. The words that follow come almost
               unwittingly.

               

                                      STARKS
                             ...What you do not know is the only
                             thing you know.

                                                                           86.

               
                                      STARKS (cont'd)
                             [Beat] And what you own is what you
                             do not own...
                             And where you are is where you are
                             not.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           [Beat] Where is that from?

               
               It's as though STARKS hears his words for the first time.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Come on. Tell me what you do know.

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I've seen a time that's not
                           this time. And I'm only able to see
                           it when I'm in the Jacket.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Well, what time is it?

               

                                     STARKS

                           2004.

               
               LORENSON nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You don't believe me.

               
                                     LORENSON [Testing him]
                           Well, what year do you think it is
                           now?
                                     STARKS [Exasperated]
                           I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.
                           Same as every sane person.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me
                           about the future. 2004. What does it
                           look like?

               

                                     STARKS
                           It doesn't look all that different.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           The future doesn't look different?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. Not for people like me. [Beat]
                           Not in the places I come from.

               

                                                                              87.

               

                                        LORENSON
                              What about the world?

               

                                        STARKS
                              I didn't see that much of it -- same
                              as now. I only saw it as part of my
                              own life.

               
               LORENSON looks at STARKS, unintentionally patronizing.

               

                                        LORENSON
                              Do you think you're traveling in
                              time? Is that it?

               
               STARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson
               simply with his air of calm resolve.

                                        STARKS
                              Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc.

               
               LORENSON searches for another approach.

               

                                        LORENSON
                              [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie
                              maybe?

               

                                       STARKS
                              Maybe.

               
                                        LORENSON [Matter-of-factly]
                              Did he tell you he tried to kill his
                              wife?

               
               STARKS nods.

               

                                        LORENSON
                              MacKenzie locked himself up in his
                              house for two months and nearly
                              starved himself to death before he
                              was brought here. All because his
                              wife left him for another man.

               
               STARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his I.V. almost
               falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and
               STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON.

               
                                      STARKS [Adjusting it himself]
                            Maybe that just makes him weak, not
                            crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat]
                            Still doesn't make me think I am.

                                      (MORE)

               

                                                                              88.

               
                                     STARKS [Adjusting it himself]
                           And, judging by the fact that you
                           just told me about another patient,
                           it doesn't even make you think I am,
                           so what don't you work on persuading
                           yourself first.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Why don't you help me?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Because I don't have time.

               

                                      LORENSON
                           Why not?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm about to die unless I do
                           something to stop it.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           And how do you know that?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Because of the future. I know what's
                           going to happen.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           William, that is just another facet
                           of my delusions.

               
               Then, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He
               pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can.

               

                                     STARKS
                           And what about your work with Eugene --
                           the kid? Is that another facet of my
                           delusions?

               
               LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at
               the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in
               her features.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           How do you know about Eugene?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You told me about him. I saw you and
                           I think you thought I knew something
                           about him. So you told me.

               
               LORENSON doesn't know what to say.

               
                                     LORENSON [Somewhat angrily]
                           How do you know about Eugene!?

               

                                                                              89.

               
                                     STARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief]
                           You told me. It's like two parts of
                           you talking through me. Look, judging
                           from your reaction, there's no other
                           way I could know about him.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           There obviously is, so what don't you
                           just tell me how you found out about
                           him.

               
               STARKS looks at her convincingly.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Some part of you suspects -- even if
                           you don't know for sure -- that what
                           I'm saying is true.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I don't know how you know about
                           Eugene, but these ideas are part of
                           your delusions.

               

                                     STARKS
                           NO! They're not my delusions! Look,
                           just leave my business with Becker to
                           me!

               

                                     LORENSON
                           One thing's got nothing to do with
                           the other.

               

                                     STARKS
                           One's got everything to do with the
                           other. So unless you want my blood on
                           your hands...leave what's between me
                           and Becker between me and Becker.

               
               LORENSON backs off, jarred by Starks' assertions and fearful
               of his debilitating vehemence.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992


               
               MACKENZIE sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the
               hallway is clear of the STAFF. Then he scuttles quickly -- all
               the time close to the wall -- to Starks' room.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992


               
               MACKENZIE gets inside, ducks as a NURSE passes and then taps
               lightly on the wall, announcing himself gladly.

               

                                                                              90.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Hey, I brought you some smokes.

               
               STARKS doesn't waste any time.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Lorenson said your wife left you for
                           another man and that's when you lost
                           it.

               
               MACKENZIE almost imperceptibly winces -- confirming the truth
               for Starks -- before he has to sit down.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank
                           you"?

                                     STARKS
                           Is it true?

               
               MACKENZIE tosses him the CIGARETTES and lights himself one.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           She left me, I tried to kill her, I
                           tried to kill myself. She was mean, I
                           was weak, I was cruel so she left, I
                           didn't plan it, didn't see it...FINE!

               
               MACKENZIE suddenly stops, distraught. When he resumes, it's
               in an oddly more normal tone than he's ever used before.

               
                                     MACKENZIE [Softly]
                           I didn't want to see it. I'm in here
                           because they say I have a nervous
                           condition. [Beat] Well, here's my
                           question, who wouldn't be nervous if
                           they really looked at their life?
                           [Beat] Whose life is that good?

               
               STARKS doesn't have an answer.

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           Not this luckless little mammal's.
                           What difference is it to them? [Beat,
                           slows down] You believe what you want
                           to believe. One version is easier
                           than another so you make it your own.

               
               As MacKenzie runs his hand over his forehead, he looks hurt,
               and sad, but strangely not a bit crazy.

               

                                                                              91.

               

                                      MACKENZIE
                            I'll tell you this though. However
                            nuts I am, I wasn't nuts enough not
                            to know how wrong it was to put a
                            human being in something like that.

               
               MACKENZIE's twitching continues as he recollects it.

               

                                      STARKS
                            MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are
                            crazy?

               

                                      MACKENZIE
                            [Shrugging] What if we are? There're
                            crazier things than thinking up
                            fictions for yourself. [Beat]
                            Everyone does it, don't they? Even
                            Becker. That roller coaster car pops
                            more pills than all of Ward 3.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Becker does? Are you sure?

               

                                     MACKENZIE
                           I've been here for 11 years. It's my
                           neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's
                           as drugged up as the rest of us...I
                           guess he has to be to put up with all
                           this.

               
               STARKS nods and MacKenzie puts his head down, suddenly
               vulnerable and embarrassed. STARKS lights TWO CIGARETTES.

               

                                      STARKS
                            Thanks for the cigarettes. You
                            still got a lot of problems,
                            MacKenzie, but you're ok.

               
               MACKENZIE and STARKS smoke together quietly.

               
               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, DECEMBER 29th, 1992


               
               STARKS is trying to see if the windows open through the bars
               covering them. It's especially hard with the I.V. still
               connected to one of his arms.

               

                                      BECKER
                            At least it's some kind of bars we've
                            got you behind.

               
               STARKS turns, startled.

               

                                                                              92.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Hello, William. I understand you've
                           been asking for me almost every hour.
                           I would've been here sooner but you
                           gave our little state visitor quite a
                           bit to talk to me about.

               

                                     STARKS
                           That's too bad.

               

                                     BECKER
                           It is. But when it comes down to it,
                           you just have to patient with them.
                           They'd rather have their vacation,
                           too, so they just push dealing with
                           our "practices" off to the New Year.

                                     STARKS
                           They make it hard for you to get away
                           with your business, huh?

               

                                     BECKER
                           Temporarily.

               
               STARKS lights a cigarette and, with that gesture, adopts the
               unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears
               little resemblance to his usual demeanor.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Makes it a little easier for me to
                           get away with mine.

               
               BECKER looks at STARKS seriously.

               

                                     BECKER
                           And what's that?

                                     STARKS
                           My business?

               

                                     BECKER
                           Yes.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Getting away with things. Like
                           whatever I may or may not have gotten
                           away with Officer Harrison.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You killed him?

               
               STARKS simply delivers one slow nod.

               

                                                                              93.

               

                                     STARKS
                           And wound up in a better cage. [Beat]
                           But I still want to make a deal.

               
               BECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS proceeds
               with the calculation of someone who is guilty.

               

                                     STARKS
                           See, the deluxe lab animal treatment
                           I've been receiving -- well, I don't
                           think it's worked. I woke up today
                           and realized... [eerily lowering his
                           voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So
                           really, what was the point? Torture?
                           I think that's still sort of illegal
                           in some states -- though we'll have to
                           check on Vermont. And, how's this for
                           the cherry on top: it seems my
                           physician is a pill-popping freak.
                           [Beat] Last time I checked, that
                           makes some pretty good copy for a lot
                           of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly]
                           "I don't remember everything they did
                           to me. I just remember the worst
                           parts." I think I should be sitting
                           down when I say it, don't you think?

               
               It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I think...I have to think about it.

               
               BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly
               makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him.
               STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared
               to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when
               he's killed.

               
               But BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm,
               tearing his skin with it.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I think your story needs a little
                           fleshing out before it's ready to go.

               
               BECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I'll say a prayer for you in Church
                           today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can
                           pick up where the medicine left off.

               

                                                                            94.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You sure you know where to find one?

               

                                     BECKER
                           I've managed to every Sunday of my
                           life. [Beat] Some of us are God-
                           fearing men, Starks.

               

                                     STARKS
                           And what does that mean?

               

                                     BECKER
                           Means we believe in doing his work
                           and fear what the world would be like
                           if we didn't at least try to.

               
               STARKS smirks at the hypocrisy he sees.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Becker, how do you sleep at night?

               

                                     BECKER
                           You in here. [Beat] Works like a
                           drug.

               
               BECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes his
               eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over.

               

               INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, EVENING


               
               LORENSON, dressed to leave, stops to talk to NINA, one of the
               evening nurses.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Nina, William Starks is to stay in
                           ICU all night. If anything is
                           supposed to change, I want to be
                           called about it.

               

                                     NINA
                           Sure, Dr. Lorenson.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, 1992


               
               LORENSON comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a
               thin, young mother, TALIA YAZDI, and her eleven year-old
               mute, and seemingly retarded son, EUGENE, waiting for her
               outside her door.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Hi. [Beat] Sorry I'm late.

               

                                                                              95.

               

                                     TALIA
                           It's ok. [To Eugene] Hi, Eugene.

               
               EUGENE returns her greeting with a blank stare.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, SOME TIME LATER


               
               LORENSON sets her things down on the kitchen table as TALIA
               starts to tidy things around the apartment.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Talia, I need to ask you something.

               
               TALIA looks at LORENSON.

               

                                     TALIA
                           What is it?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Have you told anyone about my
                           sessions with Eugene?

               
                                     TALIA [With an accent]
                           Of course not. [Off Lorenson's still
                           doubtful look] I swear I haven't. I
                           wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you.
                           You know that.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Has anyone been asking about him?

               

                                     TALIA
                           No. I would have told you.

               
               LORENSON nods. She believes her.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992


               
               STARKS spots DAMON standing cautiously in the hall.

               

               INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992


               
               We see (but don't hear) HARDING speak to NINA as DAMON slips
               into STARKS' ROOM. NINA seems sufficiently distracted.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, SECONDS LATER


               
               DAMON flashes a KNIFE at STARKS.

               

                                     DAMON
                           No funny business or we can make this
                           a lot fucking harder for you.

               

                                                                              96.

               
               One look at the KNIFE and the SAME QUESTION burns once more...

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Weakly] No funny business.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992


               
               DAMON hustles Starks down the hall as fast as they can before
               the NURSE or any other staff member spots them.

               

               INT. OFFICE/LIBRARY, LORENSON'S HOME, NIGHT


               
               EUGENE sits opposite LORENSON, who quietly observes him,
               jotting some notes down on her pad. She is intermittently
               holding up PICTURES for Eugene, asking him to repeat their
               names as if she were teaching him to read.

                                     LORENSON
                           Eugene, this is a "TRAIN."

               
               EUGENE starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and
               without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only
               with a blank stare. Lorenson quickly moves beside Eugene and
               watches him from up close, apparently not altogether
               surprised at what's happening.

               
               EUGENE doesn't even blink. The only sounds we hear from him
               are a couple, barely audible guttural noises. LORENSON --
               exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently
               addresses the boy.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Come on back down here. Wherever you
                           are...try to come on back. You'll
                           like it, I promise.

               
               Just then, TALIA walks in with TEA, JUICE and COOKIES for
               Eugene and Lorenson. She spots her son in his absent, staring
               state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid
               tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them.

               
               TALIA gently touches LORENSON'S hand. LORENSON looks at her
               warmly. TALIA knows how hard she's trying.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992


               
               BECKER soundlessly watches as HARDING and DAMON finish
               strapping Starks in the Jacket.

               
               DAMON slams the DRAWER shut, sending STARKS back in.

               What STARKS lacks in strength, he counteracts with his
               OVERWHELMING WILL. The SCREEN TREMBLES with it. One TERRIFIC,
               WHITE LIGHT and we...

               

                                                        CUT TO:

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS sits by himself in Jackie's car, parked in a gas
               station. He looks around, trying to make sure it really is
               her car. He looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and
               an empty BOTTLE of VODKA.

               
               He looks outside and sees a few people walking into the FOOD
               MART of the gas station. He trembles with cold as he looks
               down at his plaid shirt.
               Then, JACKIE unexpectedly appears outside the DRIVER'S WINDOW
               opening the car door and nearly spilling her COFFEE when she
               spots STARKS next to her.

               
               Seeing it's him though, she smiles warmly.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           You just scared me, that's all.

               
               She leans over to him and gives him a kiss, handing him the
               coffee.

               

                                      STARKS
                           Me, too.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Here, drink this. I'll get the heat
                           going.

               

               EXT. MAIN STREET, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004


               
               JACKIE speeds through the streets of Shelbourne, presumably
               on their way to Becker's house.

               

               EXT. BECKER'S NEIGHBORHOOD, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004


               
               They've slowed down a little.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY


               
               JACKIE reads from some directions on a PAPER as their CAR
               slows down on one particular street, towards one particular
               house.

               

                                                                              98.

               

               EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY


               

                                        JACKIE [O.S.]
                              I think this is his house.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS looks at the house, bedecked with a lopsided SNOW MAN
               on the front lawn.

               

                                        STARKS
                              You're sure?

               

                                        JACKIE
                              Yeah. I called the number yesterday
                              to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired

                              M.D.

               
               STARKS gets out of the car.

               

               EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS knocks on the door. No answer.

               

               EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY


               
               JACKIE tries to look through the windows to see if anyone's
               there. No one is. It looks small and dark inside.

               

               EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS knocks again, looking down anxiously at his feet.
               JACKIE walks up to him from around the side of the house.
               They don't have the time to wait.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              They're not here.

               

                                        STARKS
                              They're not.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              [Beat, lost] No.

               
               JACKIE notices how COLD Starks looks.

               

                                        JACKIE
                              Maybe they're out.

               
               STARKS nods.

               

                                                                              99.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows
               and sees NO CARS or PEOPLE on the street. JACKIE watches him
               despairingly.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           How much time do we have?

               
                                      STARKS [Distracted]
                            I don't know.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What? What are you thinking?

               

                                     STARKS
                           There're no cars on this street.

               
               JACKIE looks around; there really aren't.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can
                           that be?

               
               STARKS turns to JACKIE, thinking.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know. Maybe that's because
                           this whole thing is a dream. How can
                           you have a street with no cars on it?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I don't know. But this isn't a dream.
                           I'm real, and so is where we are.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Then why isn't there anyone around?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           [Beat] I don't know.

               
               STARKS runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in
               desperation.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What are you doing?

               
               STARKS doesn't answer.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           William! William!

               
               STARKS opens his eyes. She sighs in relief.

               

                                                                             100.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have
                           to come back.

               
               STARKS starts to shake his head in disbelief, when suddenly,
               he realizes...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Of course he will. [Beat] What day of
                           the week is it?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           It's Sunday.

               
                                      STARKS [Nodding]
                            It's Sunday.

                                     JACKIE
                           So?

               
               STARKS looks ecstatic with hope.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Look where these people live.

               
               A small, beautiful, removed place.

               

                                     STARKS
                           They've got lives to be grateful for.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           William, you're not making sense.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet
                           that's where Becker is.

               EXT. STREETS, SHELBOURNE


               
               JACKIE and STARKS head back to the only MAIN STREET in the
               town. As they approach the town church, they start to see a
               ROW of cars parallel-parked on the street.

               
               JACKIE pulls up to the entrance of the CHURCH.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY


               
               STARKS watches JACKIE get out of the car and walk up to the
               doors of the CHURCH.

               

               EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004


               
               JACKIE boldly opens the CHURCH door.

               

                                                                            101.

               

               INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004


               
               JACKIE sees the town seated in the Church. The PRIEST looks
               up at her briefly and some people turn around, but she closes
               the DOOR before she causes a major interruption.

               

               INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004


               
               We move to the third or fourth row, where, from behind, we
               see a head of GREY HAIR. He slowly turns around, casting a
               look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face.
               Though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened.

               

               EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004


               
               JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of Church.
               They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him.

               
               DR. BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his
               GRANDSON. JACKIE registers his formidableness with some
               surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly
               a shade less intimidating than he was before. Only his hand
               has a permanent shake now.

               
               STARKS doesn't waste any time. He heads straight for him.
               Almost sensing him, BECKER looks in his direction. The casual
               look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of DISBELIEF.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You still go to Church. How's that
                           work? Your God just doesn't notice?
                           That it? [Beat, serious] How you
                           doin', Dr. Becker?

               
               BECKER stops walking and looks at Starks. His GRANDSON looks
               at him.

                                      BECKER'S GRANDSON
                           Grandpa?

               
                                      BECKER [Still looking at Starks]
                            Sean, why don't you wait for me by
                            the car? I'll be there in a minute.
                            [Turning to the kid] Ok?

               
               His grandson, momentarily appeased, heads for the car.

               
                                     BECKER [To Starks]
                           Can I help you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know, Dr. Becker. Can you?

               

                                                                             102.

               
               That's enough to confirm for BECKER who STARKS is.

               
               All around them, people leaving Church socialize routinely --
               unaware of the haunted history being made between them.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Who are you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I think you know. Your eyes say you
                           do.

               

                                     BECKER
                           [Beat] You're his son?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat]
                           What? You look like you've seen a
                           ghost. You can come here and touch
                           me, old man. I'm the real thing.

               

                                     BECKER
                           How...how are you here?

               
               STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the
               other's past.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You died, Starks. Years ago, in the
                           hospital.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't
                           you?

               

                                     BECKER
                           No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I
                           probably helped push you to kill
                           yourself, but I didn't do it.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I didn't kill myself. I died from a
                           blow to the head. How'd it happen? I
                           have to know.

               
               BECKER looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I don't know how you died. The last
                           time I put you in the Jacket was just
                           after you told me you remembered
                           killing that police officer...

               

                                                                   103.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I didn't say I remembered killing
                           him. I just repeated some words to
                           get myself back in there.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I know. [Beat] I knew that when you
                           came out.

               

                                     STARKS
                           How?

               

                                     BECKER
                           Because...because you came out and
                           said something you couldn't have
                           possibly have known. You came back
                           and repeated three names...

               
               BECKER falters as he recalls his offenses.

               

                                     BECKER
                           Of people like you. People I was just
                           trying to help. They couldn't get
                           worse so I thought, with medication,
                           they might get...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Medication? What kind of meds do you
                           chase with nights in a cadaver
                           drawer?

               

                                     BECKER
                           It was part of the treatment I
                           intended...I didn't know what the
                           effects would be...

               

                                     STARKS
                           So, what, you guinea pig sick people
                           to find out?

               

                                     BECKER
                           The three of you weren't regular
                           patients. You were criminals that
                           ended up at Alpine Grove.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No, we were patients.

               
               BECKER concedes after all this time.

               

                                     BECKER
                           You and the others didn't seem that
                           way then.

               

                                                                          104.

               
               STARKS is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to
               work out: if Becker tells him those names now, he essentially
               indicts himself.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Who were the others?

               
               BECKER remembers with a hint of remorse.

               
                                     BECKER [Racked with remorse]
                           Nathan Piechowski, Jackson
                           MacGregor, and Ted Casey. [Beat] I
                           didn't ask for you -- for any of
                           you. You were all sent to me.

               
               STARKS looks at Becker, in astonishment.

                                     BECKER
                           What is it?

               
               STARKS just stares at Becker, waiting for the realization to
               hit him, too.

               

                                     BECKER
                           How did you come to know their
                           names?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You just told me. The last time I
                           was with you was when I was in the
                           Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr.
                           Becker.

               

                                     BECKER
                           I don't understand...

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're
                           haunting yourself right now. [Beat]
                           I guess sometimes we indict
                           ourselves if no one else does. You
                           didn't make history like you wanted
                           to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out
                           different, didn't it?

               

                                     BECKER
                           I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and
                           then you put me in the Jacket.

               

                                                                            105.

               
                                      BECKER [Stoically]
                            I was sorry when I heard you died.
                            I was, but...how was I to know you
                            didn't shoot that police officer?

               

                                     STARKS
                           The same way you just said I didn't
                           without my ever telling you. [Beat]
                           And that still doesn't excuse what
                           you did. Just because you had keys
                           to a cage didn't mean you had
                           animals inside. [Beat] You've
                           earned your guilt, Becker.

               
               STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away
               towards the car.

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, DAY, 2004


               
               JACKIE and STARKS sit inside the parked car as STARKS touches
               his head.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           That's all you got from him? That
                           bastard helped take your life away
                           from you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No, he didn't.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What? How can you say that? He's
                           the one that put you in that
                           goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's
                           probably the one who killed you.

               
               And with those words, JACKIE starts to break down.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No one's killing anyone.

               
               STARKS takes her hand and runs it over his head.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Touch me. I'm okay.

               
               STARKS looks at her with love, understanding and, for the
               first time, a sense of peace. He strokes her hair to calm her
               down.

               

                                                                          106.

               

                                     STARKS
                           If everything hadn't happened the
                           way it has, then I wouldn't be here
                           right now, sitting in a car with
                           you, touching your face.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Why are you saying that? [Beat] We
                           don't have long, do we?

               
               STARKS looks at her without answering. JACKIE wipes her eyes,
               fastens STARKS' seat belt, and seeing that Starks' EYES have
               started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the
               barely audible sound of the DRAWER opening, and their time
               ending, is heard.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Where are we going?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           To the hospital.

               

               EXT. HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DAY, 2004


               
               JACKIE and STARKS speed on the highway. As STARKS sleeps,
               JACKIE keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure
               he stays with her.

               

               INT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004


               
               JACKIE helps STARKS -- who's severely weakened at this point --
               to the nurse's station. CLAIRE is there.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Claire, I need help.

               
               CLAIRE helps JACKIE, and they take him into a room. From
               afar, we hear CLAIRE asking about him.

               

                                     STARKS
                           What's happening to me? Why am I
                           getting so much weaker?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Because your body can only take so
                           much of what they're putting you
                           through.

               

                                     CLAIRE
                           Jesus, what's happened to him?

               

                                                                             107.

               

               INT. ROOM, HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004


               
               JACKIE helps CLAIRE do for STARKS what they can; it doesn't
               seem like much at this point.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Lorenson's the only one that could
                           let me out of there. I need something
                           to persuade her that I was there. Get
                           me something to take to her.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Ok. Ssh. Rest.

               

               INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, 2004


               
               JACKIE stands above a PRINTER as it prints the information
               she's looked up about Dr. Lorenson. The PAPER gets jammed,
               and that's when JACKIE completely loses it. She WRESTLES with
               the printer as if it were responsible for what's happening.

               
               Then she realizes she's not alone. She looks back and sees
               CLAIRE, watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in
               her eyes.

               
                                      JACKIE [In a panic]
                            He's not...?

               

                                     CLAIRE
                           No, no. [Beat] Not yet. But he
                           doesn't have long. Are you sure you
                           don't want a doctor to look at him?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           No! It won't do any good. [Beat]
                           Please, Claire. They won't
                           understand.

               
               CLAIRE acquiesces with her eyes.

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE


               
               STARKS is trapped: back on the day when Officer Harrison was
               murdered.

               

                                                         FLASHBACK TO:

               

               EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, LATE AFTERNOON, 1992


               
               (Cont'd from the scene after STARKS left Jean and Jackie's
               place):

               

                                                                          108.

               
               STARKS is walking back on the same highway just after the sun
               has set, and just after he helped JEAN and JACKIE, on that
               fateful day...

               
               This time we see a CAR stop for him from a much closer
               distance. TENNY pulls up towards STARKS and rolls down the
               window on the passenger side. STARKS bends down to be able to
               see the driver.

               

                                     TENNY
                           Hey, Mister, you need a ride?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Where are you going?

               

                                     TENNY
                           I'm going to Canada but I can let
                           you ride with me up to the border.

               
               STARKS considers this.

               

                                     TENNY
                           Can you drive?

               

                                        STARKS
                           Sure.

               

                                     TENNY
                           Great, get in. We'll switch off in
                           a bit.

               
               We pull back and see the same SHOT, from a distance, of
               STARKS putting his BAG in the back and getting in. As he
               opens the CAR DOOR, we hear the MUSIC playing inside. As they
               drive off, the MUSIC fades further and further in the
               distance as we...

               INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT


               
               It's the night that they slept together, and the departure we
               never saw. We see, from Starks' POV, JACKIE sleeping
               serenely in the bed.

               
               We catch one glimpse of STARKS in the moonlight, standing
               naked in the doorway, before he turns and then...disappears --
               having been taken out of the Jacket at that point.

               

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, VERMONT, 2004


               
               JACKIE is by STARKS' side, lying on the hospital bed, next to
               him, smoothing his sweating head.

               

                                                                           109.

                           William, please, honey, wake up.
                           For me.

               
               STARKS' eyes flutter open.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Can you hear me?

               
               STARKS nods; JACKIE tries to continue without choking up.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I found out about Eugene. The little
                           boy. He's the key. That's who you
                           have to tell her about when you get
                           back there. It's the only way to
                           prove this to her.

               
               JACKIE's VOICE fades as we...

                                                        RETURN TO:

               

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, VERMONT, 2004 (SOME TIME LATER)


               
               STARKS is awake, watching JACKIE sleep wearily on his chest.
               He sees the TOLL this has taken on her, just as he senses he
               is about to be taken out of the Jacket. He nudges her gently.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Jackie?

               
               JACKIE stirs her eyes to look at him.

               
                                      STARKS [Somewhat urgently]
                            Where do you live?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           What?

               

                                     STARKS
                           When we first met, when you were 7,
                           where was the house you lived in
                           with your mother? Do you remember
                           your address?

               

                                                                               110.

               

                                       JACKIE
                             112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a
                             whisper] You're not coming back,
                             are you?

               
               STARKS, faint, struggles to get out of the bed.

               

                                       STARKS
                             You gotta stop thinking like that.

               

                                       JACKIE
                             Then, where are you going?

               

                                       STARKS
                             Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm
                             gonna be sick.
               STARKS   moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room.
               JACKIE   moves to help him and he motions for her to stop.
               STARKS   falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at
               Jackie   -- like it might be for the last time.

               
                                      JACKIE [In a whisper]
                            You come back to me...

               
               STARKS nods, then goes in and closes the door behind him.
               JACKIE stares after him -- alone in the total silence of the
               room. She listens for the slightest noise and that's when she
               actually hears the sound of the DRAWER being opened for
               herself.

               
               She realizes he's gone. She RUSHES after him, opens the door
               in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of
               Starks. JACKIE falls to her knees, right there, on the
               bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to
               realize how unfathomably deep her heart is...

               INT. ALPINE GROVE, 2004


               
               STARKS is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's
               office -- still severely weakened.

               
               He walks slowly to the OFFICE DOOR and feebly knocks.
               LORENSON answers and STARKS falls into her arms.

               
                                       LORENSON [Stunned]
                             Oh dear God.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE


               
               LORENSON has laid STARKS down on the COUCH in her office.
               STARKS can barely talk. He spews as much of it as he can out
               in his feverish state...

               

                                                                             111.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm William Starks. I'm not his son.
                           And...and the kid you work with.
                           Your friend's son...Eugene...

               
               LORENSON is stilled by the words STARKS just spoke.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I know. I know it all. Save your
                           strength. I already know everything
                           you're going to say. [Beat] You're in
                           the Jacket right now, aren't you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           How...how do you know?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You told me this was how it
                           happened.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I did?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Yeah.

               
               STARKS clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him
               out.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Who...who kills me?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You have nothing to fear, William.

               
               But when we look to see STARKS' reaction, he's not there...

               INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING


               
               BECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly
               decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not
               his SCARF, and walks out of his office with a decided
               urgency.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992


               
               BECKER pulls STARKS out of the drawer and looks down ruefully
               at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT,
               seeks the outline of Becker's face in the light.

               
                                     STARKS [Whispering]
                           Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I
                           know what you did to your patients.

               

                                                                             112.

               
               BECKER looses the straps around Starks' neck to help him
               speak.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson
                           MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You
                           didn't cure them. You killed them.

               
               BECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien.
               After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands
               trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when,
               instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He
               silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking
               unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a
               stretcher.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING


               
               As the SUN starts to rise, we see STARKS -- now cleaned up --
               recovering in his bed. He is unconscious. From his window, we
               look down and see Dr. Lorenson's car pulling into the lot...

               

                                                          FADE TO:

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING


               
               LORENSON, still wearing her winter gear, walks into Starks'
               room, anxiously checking his VITALS. Her anxious expression
               reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and
               sees an empty chair with only Becker's SCARF on it.

               
               LORENSON goes to the window in time to see BECKER getting
               into his car.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, LATER THAT MORNING


               
               STARKS lies unconscious in the bed. The NURSE, SALLY, stops
               by the room to check on Dr. Lorenson.

               

                                     SALLY
                           Would you like anything, Dr.
                           Lorenson?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           A cup of coffee would be great,
                           Sally. Thanks.

               

                                     SALLY
                           Is he gonna be ok?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I hope so.

               

                                                                          113.

               

                                       SALLY
                           Me, too.

               
               LORENSON looks after her as she leaves.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, MORNING, 1992


               
               LORENSON wakes up as STARKS stirs in his sleep, slowly waking
               up.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You're going to be ok, William. We
                           just need to get your fever down
                           and we'll be able to hopefully
                           stabilize you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Who are you kidding, Doc? You or
                           me?

               
               LORENSON doesn't answer.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Can I get some paper and something
                           to write with.

               

                                       LORENSON
                           What for?

               
                                      STARKS [Solemnly]
                            I'm starting to think I'm really
                            gonna die soon. So I'd like to write
                            some things down.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I'm not gonna let that happen.

                                     STARKS
                           You still don't believe me, do you?

               

                                     LORENSON
                           I do believe you...

               

                                     STARKS
                           No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...

               
               LORENSON still gets taken aback by Starks' knowledge of
               Eugene.

               

                                     STARKS
                           No one knows you're working with him
                           so how would I have found out? He's
                           your friend's son, right?

               

                                                                             114.

               
               It's true; no one could have known about Lorenson's private
               life. STARKS coughs, clearly in great pain.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           William, I can't indulge these
                           delusions, even when you're in this
                           state.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Listen to me. That's all I ask.

               
               LORENSON has no choice.

               

                                     STARKS
                           He's having absence [pronounced
                           "absance"] seizures when he stares
                           off into space like he does. He has
                           them so often that that's why he
                           hasn't learned to speak properly.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Who told you this?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You did, in the future. You figured
                           it out because a part of you already
                           knows this. That's how it works.
                           [Beat] I'm just telling you something
                           you already know, even if you haven't
                           realized it.

               
               STARKS closes his eyes, gathering what strength he can.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I don't know when it'll happen but
                           soon I think, you'll shock the boy
                           and it'll wake him up.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           What are you talking about?

               

                                     STARKS
                           You'll figure it out and you'll do
                           good by him.

               
               That's all STARKS can manage before LORENSON sees he's about
               to pass out again.

               

                                                         CUT TO:

               

               INT. LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992


               

                                                                             115.

               
               LORENSON answers the KNOCK at her door. It's EUGENE and

               TALIA.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Hey.

               

                                     TALIA
                           What is it?

               
                                      LORENSON [Finding it hard to explain]
                            Nothing. [Beat] I don't know. I
                            thought of something I could try.

               
               LORENSON looks at TALIA helplessly. TALIA nods and leads
               Eugene inside. LORENSON can't help but look down the hall to
               make sure no one's there.

               INT. STUDY/OFFICE, LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992


               
               LORENSON sits across from EUGENE, holding up a picture of a
               DOG. Between them is a tray of MILK and COOKIES.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Come on Eugene, try to say it with
                           me. This is a "DOG".

               

                                     EUGENE
                           D--d---d----.

               
               But Eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to
               make the word. An absence seizure takes hold of him as he
               looks out unconsciously into space.

               
               LORENSON moves closer to him.

               
                                      LORENSON [Softly]
                            What's happening to you?

               
               LORENSON checks Eugene's pulse and leans in close to the
               boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just
               looks hard enough.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Are you having a seizure? Is that
                           really what's going on?

               
               LORENSON spots a corner of Eugene's EYE twitching slightly,
               and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the
               nearby LAMP and holds it above his head so she can get a
               better look at him.

               

                                                                             116.

               
               Just then, TALIA opens the door, startling Lorenson. She
               knocks over the MILK and, as it spills on the LAMP CORD -- now
               on Eugene's lap -- it causes an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Eugene catches
               it. TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear.

               
               The moment passes and Eugene -- more responsive than he has
               ever been before -- looks at his mother and Lorenson. He
               doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake,
               like never before.

               
               EUGENE picks right up where he and Lorenson left off.

               

                                     EUGENE
                           Dog. [To Talia] Hi.

               
               TALIA and LORENSON look at him and each other at shock.
                                     STARKS [O.S., distantly]
                           You're going to...shock the boy and
                           then things will change for him.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You ok, Eugene?

               
               EUGENE holds Lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments.

               
                                      LORENSON [Stunned himself]
                            Yeah, you are ok.

               

                                     TALIA
                           What's happening?

               
                                     LORENSON [Putting the pieces together]
                           He got a little shock. [To himself]
                           And it's reset him. Not permanently
                           probably...but at least for a little
                           while. They use it on epileptic
                           patients sometimes...

               

                                     TALIA
                           But he's not epileptic.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           No, but he is having seizures.

               
               TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's
               merely surprised.

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992


               
               STARKS looks up from his PAPER -- now covered in WORDS -- to
               see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but
               much better than before.

               

                                                                           117.

               

                                     STARKS
                           It worked, didn't it?

               
               LORENSON nods.

               

                                     STARKS
                           This is really happening, isn't it?

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           [Beat] What do you need me to do?

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] Thank you.

               
               STARKS folds the LETTER.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I need to get this letter to
                           someone.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           I can't take you out of here in
                           your condition...

               

                                     STARKS
                           And I can't stay here in my
                           condition. I am going to die
                           tonight. It's already been decided.

               

                                     DR. LORENSON
                           No, it hasn't.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up
                           'till today is done. Everything
                           starting with tomorrow is up for
                           grabs.

               

               EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992


               
               LORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DAY, 1992


               
               LORENSON and STARKS are driving on the same, now familiar
               highway.

               

                                     STARKS
                           You know how to get there?

               

                                                                             118.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           Sure. It's an easy address. A
                           little far out there, but easy
                           enough.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Good.

               
               Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him
               and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON
               notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live.

               

               EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992


               
               DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house.

               

                                     LORENSON
                           You want me to come with you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           No, I'll be ok.

               
               STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on
               it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still
               understandably soft.

               
               STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He
               opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the
               devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on.

               
               JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years
               old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the
               disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman
               he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to
               break down.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Hi.

               
                                     JACKIE [Surprised]
                           Hey. [Beat] I remember you.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I remember you, too.

               
               STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful,
               and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate --
               when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible
               from this innocent, still promising image.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Jackie, how have you been?

               

                                                                             119.

               
               JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           I've been ok.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Good. How's your mom?

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Ok, I guess.

               
               STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to
               crumble.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Do you think I could see her?
               She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in
               his eyes.

               

                                       JACKIE
                           Sure.

               
               JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get
               her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting
               outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.

               
               Some seconds later, JEAN appears -- gaunt but in a slightly
               better state than we saw her before.

               

                                     JEAN
                           Can I help you?

               

                                     STARKS
                           Hey, Jean. Nice to see you.

               
               JEAN looks a little confused.

               

                                     JEAN
                           I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully
                           familiar, I just can't quite place
                           it...

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Mom, this is the guy that drove us
                           home that afternoon we were stuck
                           on the highway. The guy you yelled
                           at for no good reason...

               

                                       JEAN
                           Oh, yeah.

               

                                                                             120.

               
               She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks,
               decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices
               LORENSON waiting by the car.

               

                                      JEAN
                            There something you need?

               

                                      STARKS
                            You could say that.

               
               STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing
               this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave.

               

                                      JEAN
                            Jackie, go play in the snow.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Why?

               

                                      JEAN
                            Just do it.

               
               JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches.

               

                                      STARKS
                            I can't stay long. [Motioning to
                            Lorenson] That's my doctor and I
                            gotta get back to the hospital.
                            Everything I want to say is in this
                            letter. [Beat] You can check as
                            much of it as you can.

               
               STARKS hands her the LETTER.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I won't be around when you read
                           it...but I hope you believe it.
                           It'd be a real shame if you didn't.

               
               JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.

               

                                     STARKS
                           [Beat] I should be on my way.

               
               JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he
               looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what
               strength he has left...

               

                                     STARKS
                           Bye, Jackie.

               

                                                                             121.

               
               These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to
               say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows
               himself out.

               

                                      STARKS
                            Happy New Year to both of you.

               

                                      JEAN
                            Thanks. You, too.

               

               EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992


               
               As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in
               the cold -- but not from it.

               

               INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

               JACKIE abruptly runs after him.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Hey, wait!

               
               STARKS stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from
               his face as he can before he turns around to face her.

               

                                      STARKS
                            [Beat] You be good to yourself,
                            Jackie.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Ok.

               
               Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she
               did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly
               in the cold.

               
               STARKS takes JACKIE'S HAND and holds it in his own softly and
               affectionately. JEAN and DR. LORENSON look on curiously as
               STARKS looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the
               heavens for the means to get through this.

               
               As STARKS lets go at last, JACKIE looks back at him, sensing
               the connection even if she doesn't know it yet.

               
               STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car.
               LORENSON moves to help him, but STARKS tells her not to with
               his eyes. He makes his way to the car on his own.

               

               MONTAGE:

               

               INT. LIVING ROOM, JEAN AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992


               

                                                                             122.

               
               JEAN sits down and starts to open the LETTER. Starks' voice,
               as we hear it now, is presumably from parts of the LETTER
               he's written to her.

               

               INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DUSK, 1992


               
               LORENSON looks over to STARKS, who stares painfully out the
               window. They drive on in silence.

               

                                     STARKS (V.O.)
                           I was 25 years old the first time I
                           died. It didn't end anything though.
                           [Beat] Sometimes I think we live
                           through things only to be able to
                           tell them, to bear witness, to say
                           this happened.

               INT. ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992-1993


               
               STARKS walks back through the gates of the hospital,
               despondently returning inside, with LORENSON at his side.

               

                                      STARKS (V.O.)
                            And it wasn't to someone else. It
                            was to me. And I lived despite it.
                            Sometimes I think we live to beat
                            the odds. And sometimes I agree
                            that life can only begin with the
                            knowledge of death. That it can all
                            end, even when you least want it
                            to.

               

               INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING


               
               MACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as LORENSON
               helps STARKS down the hall. He holds up his hand in the
               gesture of hello, or goodbye.

               
               STARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile.

               

                                      STARKS
                            I'm telling you my story because
                            it's the only way I can try to help
                            your daughter, and you, have a
                            better one of your own.

               

               INT. BECKER'S HOME, SHELBOURNE, 1992


               
               We see BECKER taking his DRUGS. In his dark den, on his worn
               desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he
               administers to himself whatever aid he can...

               

               INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992


               

                                                                            123.

               
               JEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last
               words.

               

                                     STARKS (V.O.)
                           It's scary...and lucky...how much we
                           can forget. Scary because we think
                           the past gives us our bearing, and
                           lucky because in those moments I'm
                           talking about, you realize it
                           doesn't. And it never had to.

               

               INT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992


               
               TENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a
               drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a
               BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar...

               INT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992


               
               JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking
               for something specific in them. She stops finally when she
               finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts
               them around her neck.

               

                                     STARKS (V.O.)
                           I am not a crazy man, even though
                           they mistook me for one. I live in
                           the same world as the rest of you.
                           Only I saw more of it.

               
               Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them
               under her sweater.

               

               INT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992


               
               CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV
               broadcasting news about MIKE TYSON'S RAPE CONVICTION.
               Medley's barely watching the footage...

               

               INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, 1992


               
               Dr. Lorenson helps Starks back to bed. STARKS looks up at
               Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes.
               LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more
               weakened self.

               

                                     STARKS (V.O.)
                           And the seeing is the only way you
                           can hear what the truth around you
                           is saying: you can always start
                           believing in things you don't
                           already believing in. And, while
                           you're alive, it's never too late.

               

                                                                             124.

               
               Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks'
               room and the screen darken at the same time.

               

               INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992


               
               TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the
               night, through the now familiar passage to the basement...

               
               STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is
               walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his
               forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT.

               
               They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS
               appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON
               beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS.

               
               In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT...

               

                                     DISTORTED VOICE
                           No! Wa...atch out!

               
               But STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER
               on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF
               GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks'
               head.

               
               BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain
               their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the
               PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right.

               
               The details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the
               WOUND they said he died from.

               

               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992


               
               STARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped
               into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head
               onto the floor.

               
               The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight
               onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently,
               as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the
               JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one.

               
               When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and
               the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles
               kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the
               room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in.

               
               As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on
               the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the
               room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS
               in.

               

                                                                             125.

               

               INT. JACKET/TUNNEL


               
               It's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been
               before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as
               though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he
               sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a
               tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally
               retrieved his memory without it haunting him...

               

                                      STARKS (V.O.)
                            I promise you, Jean. No matter how
                            bad the days and things around you
                            look, they look better awake than
                            they do asleep. I can offer you
                            some proof: when you die, there's
                            only one thing you want to have
                            happen...sometimes so badly it
                            comes true, I guess. [Beat] You
                            want to come back.

               

               PANELS:

               
               The PANELS we saw briefly are completed further now.

               
               1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK as a small child's HAND touches it.

               

               2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME): STARKS,

               aged 9, running up the stairs, knocking a PICTURE on the wall
               with his elbow...

               
               3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH of Starks' father, a
               much older version of himself.

               
               4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water that's not to deep and,

               on its surface, the reflection of a TEENAGE BOY'S FACE before
               he touches it and sends it rippling...
               5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH: STARKS (20s) dressed in a black

               suit, holding an URN, letting the ASHES fly into the water...

               
               6) EXT. DESERT: A SANDSTORM WHIRLS round before it's replaced

               with... EXT. VERMONT: A FIELD of snow.


               

               EXT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, MENTAL HOSPITAL


               
               We see now that it was DR. LORENSON who put Starks in.
               Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there,
               she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one
               way to look after Starks.

               

               INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, VERMONT, 1992


               

                                                                             126.

               
               JEAN puts down STARKS' LETTER and walks out of the kitchen
               and watches JACKIE sitting absently on the couch, looking
               past the TV.

               
               JEAN kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her
               daughter in the eye. JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN
               wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her
               lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly
               missed a tragedy.

               

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

               

               EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2005


               
               Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades
               up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing
               in the parking lot outside the diner once more.

               
               This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly
               longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the
               same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM
               and an unmistakable air of vitality.

               
               Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same
               attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even
               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a
               BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is
               someone we see she wants to be near.

               
               Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,
               alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
               leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the
               world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her
               being.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Hey there. [Beat] You ok?

               
               STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion.

               

                                     STARKS
                           I think so.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           You're bleeding pretty bad there.

               
               STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD
               on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she
               moves closer to calm him.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just
                            a cut. We can get it fixed.

                                      (MORE)

               

                                                                             127.

               
                                      JACKIE (cont'd)
                            But we need to get you to the
                            hospital now. How'd you get that?

               

                                      STARKS
                            I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.

               
               STARKS looks at her -- immensely relieved and grateful.

               
                                      JACKIE [Laughing a little]
                            Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's
                            New Year's Day. You're not going to
                            get a cab. Especially not here. And
                            you're gonna freeze if you stand out
                            here in the snow much longer. I'm on
                            my way back to my shift at the
                            hospital...

               

                                      STARKS
                            You work there?

               
                                      JACKIE [Gesturing to her uniform]
                            Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let
                            me give you a ride...

               
               STARKS falters slightly as he walks. JACKIE helps him make it
               to the car, much like before...

               

                                      STARKS
                            Thanks.

               

               INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2005


               
               STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL PHONE
               suddenly rings.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Sorry, one sec.

               
               JACKIE answers it, smiling.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Hey! How are you? [Beat] Thanks. I
                            was just thinking about you, too.

               
               STARKS listens nervously to her conversation and the
               affection in her voice.

               

                                      JACKIE
                            Listen, I gotta go, mom, 'cause I'm
                            late... but, thanks. Happy New Year to
                            you, too. I'll call you later. [Beat]
                            Ok, bye.

               

                                                                            128.

               
               JACKIE hangs up and looks at Starks -- feeling a little
               awkward after the call.

               

                                     JACKIE
                           Sorry about that. It was my mom.

               
               STARKS smiles back warmly at her; he gets it more than she
               knows.

               

                                     STARKS
                           Nothin' to worry about there.

               

               EXT. OVERHEAD, VERMONT HIGHWAY, 2005


               
               Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other,
               more modern cars on the highway.

                                     JACKIE (O.S.)
                           How you doin'?

               

                                     STARKS
                           I'm doing fine.

               
               The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues,
               uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then
               louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the DRAWER
               creaking as it's opened once more...

               

                                         THE END

               FADE IN:

               INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY

               CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.

               The credits begin to roll.

               Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in 
               preparation for a formal reception.

               Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.

               Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.

               Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.

               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.

               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with 
               decorative garnish.

               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting 
               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, 
               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and 
               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, 
               sour look.

               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared 
               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet 
               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing 
               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The 
               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.

               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.

               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, 
               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From 
               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A 
               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.

               EXT. ESTATE - DAY

               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a 
               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, 
               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He 
               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.

               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the 
               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.

               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly 
               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. 
               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling 
               the staff to clean up the mess.

               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS

               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.

               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.

               Hot water is poured into a bath.

               Carriages begin to arrive.

               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.

               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.

               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat 
               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens 
               a corset around his mid-section from behind.

               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.

               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver 
               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch 
               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.

               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet 
               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold 
               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and 
               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.

               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his 
               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.

               CLOSE UP

               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.

               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.

               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.

               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.

               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.

               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails 
               to the knees is fitted to his torso.

               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.

               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.

               His cheeks are pinched.

               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.

               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He 
               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a 
               waffle:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like a herd of cattle, 
                         Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman 
                         who lights up the room... simply by 
                         leaving it.

               He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, 
               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold 
               in the looking glass.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join 
                         us downstairs after completing this 
                         one-sided flash of wit?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle 
                         Otto. No one really listens to anyone 
                         else. If you attempt it, you will 
                         see why.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         You judge everything too severely. I 
                         wonder what would happen if you were 
                         to cast that critical eye inward?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You do not wonder at all. You merely 
                         ask in order to state your own 
                         opinion.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         We are all concerned about you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ahh, here it comes.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Your life does not seem to have any 
                         direction. At the age of 25 a man is 
                         too young to do anything well. At 35 
                         he is too old. Now is your time to 
                         take action. Tell me, what is it you 
                         want to DO with your life?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (wearily)
                         I do not know.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                              (just as weary)
                         Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
                              (he slaps Leopold's 
                              face twice rather 
                              quickly)
                         Wake up! This is your one and only 
                         life. Every man has the chance to 
                         make a difference. DO something!

               Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am most grateful for your 
                         surveillance and for your sympathy. 
                         I assure you there is no need for 
                         concern. I am as effectual and 
                         attentive... as my position allows.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Life is not position, Leopold. It is 
                         action.
                              (he straightens 
                              Leopold's tie)
                         I will see you downstairs promptly. 
                         In the appropriate frame of mind.

               He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. 
               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. 
               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.

               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He 
               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...

                                     THE VALET
                              (grandly)
                         Go spread joy.

               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian 
               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance 
               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is 
               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting 
               God.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically 
               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly 
               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.

               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing 
               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out 
               of frame.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 
               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away 
               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows 
               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams 
               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky 
               teeth.

               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of 
               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he 
               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except 
               her enormous bosom.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like an angel, Miss 
                         Fairchild. You light up the room. I 
                         thank you.

               Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, 
               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.

               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She 
               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. 
               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good evening. I do not believe I 
                         have had the pleasure.

               The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes 
               he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.

                                     CARLSON
                         ...Julia Carlson.

               Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (slightly tipsy)
                         You are not from the area, are you?

                                     CARLSON
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              her head "No")
                         Are you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is my estate.

                                     CARLSON
                         Really?
                              (looking around the 
                              room)
                         Well it's not home but it's much...

               Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There 
               is a hubbub amongst the guests.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.

                                     CARLSON
                         The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't 
                         it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is a scandal nonetheless.

               Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson, do me the honor?

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (smiling seductively)
                         Truly I would be in your debt. Any 
                         admonition would be erased simply by 
                         presenting a partner as lovely as 
                         yourself.

                                     CARLSON
                         No, no. Really, I...

               Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, 
               takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.

               They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA-
               BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, 
               shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suppose we really ought to sing 
                         along.

                                     CARLSON
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, golly.

               They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their 
               emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes 
               freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                              (breathless)
                         Thank you for the dance. It was 
                         lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Not at all. It was most enlightening.

               There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes 
               midnight.

                                     CARLSON
                         I really must be going.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I won't hear of it.

                                     CARLSON
                              (moving away from him)
                         No, I'm quite late as it is.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shall see you to the door...

                                     CARLSON
                              (stopping him 
                              resolutely)
                         You're very sweet. I had a wonderful 
                         time.
                              (she watches him, 
                              memorizing his face. 
                              Then firmly)
                         Goodbye.

               Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He 
               watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard 
               door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.

               EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

               Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the 
               dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes 
               back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She 
               is once again writing in her notebook.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson?

               Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. 
               Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, 
               MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting 
               a weird glow.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God...

                                     CARLSON
                         What are you...? You frightened me.

               Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch 
               it...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What sort of mechanism is this?

               Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!

                                     CARLSON
                         It's perfectly all right. It's...

               Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. 
               Carlson FREEZES.

                                     CARLSON
                              (carefully, 
                              deliberately)
                         Listen to me. Please. Move very 
                         slowly. Step out of the machine. 
                         Step out and I'll explain whatever 
                         you want to know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this? Who are you?

               His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.

                                     CARLSON
                         Oh, God.

               She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, 
               accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls 
               from the machine.

                                     CARLSON
                              (suddenly frantic)
                         Get out of there! Get out now!

               The machine LIGHTS UP.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson... I...

                                     CARLSON
                         No!!!

               The compartment door snaps shut.

                                     CARLSON
                         Shit!!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. N.Y.C. LABORATORY - 1995 DAY

               The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an 
               Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of 
               enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She turns to her co-workers, warning them.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She looks back at Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR. 
               DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Good God!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Everybody stay calm... Lock the front 
                         door.

               Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious 
               Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         No, no, no. You mustn't touch him. 
                         The consequences could be 
                         catastrophic.

                                     DR. KAU
                         He could be hurt, or even dead.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         ...All right. Touch him.

               They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on 
               the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         ...But I'm stuck and it's only a 
                         dance and he IS the seventh Duke of 
                         Albany...

               They all look at one another, then back at Leopold.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Carlson...!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (racing from the room)
                         Give me a minute...

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!

               INT. LAB - KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               KATHERINE COLES, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically 
               into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard 
               not to sound upset.

                                     KATE
                         Who's upset? People fall in love, 
                         they have to climb back out.
                              (she laughs but she 
                              is not smiling)
                         So, what? We'll just be friends now, 
                         Right?

               She stops typing and listens for a while. She runs her hand 
               through her hair.

                                     KATE
                         I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
                              (using her middle 
                              finger she pushes up 
                              her glasses)
                         No. I'll just think of this as 
                         surviving another dating accident. 
                         Take care or good luck or whatever 
                         I'm supposed to...

               The line goes dead.

                                     KATE
                         ...say... Goodbye.

               Dr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly 
               becomes very centered.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         She's back.

                                     KATE
                              (rising)
                         That's impossible! She wasn't supposed 
                         to return until...

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Kate. It's Carlson. Something went 
                         wrong.

               He hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down.

                                     KATE
                         ...The 7th Duke...

               INT. LAB - DAY

                                     KATE
                              (all business, reading 
                              from a printout)
                         ...of Albany. He was the... IS the 
                         son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no 
                         actual importance until he vanished 
                         at the turn of the century without a 
                         trace. It was a sensation. In the 
                         30's they even made a movie about 
                         him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (absently)
                         I love Ronald Coleman.

                                     KATE
                         Despite much speculation and a nation 
                         wide investigation, a body was never 
                         found. He was never heard from again.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Until now.

               There is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We've altered the course of history.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We never should have started this...

                                     KATE
                         Calm down.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         What are we going to do? We can't 
                         keep him here. Imagine if anyone 
                         found out!

                                     KATE
                         Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, 
                         no one would believe such a stupid 
                         mistake could be made because no one 
                         would believe any of this is possible. 
                         So. We fix this. We keep this to 
                         ourselves and we fix it. Fast.

               They all nod in agreement.

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st 
                         priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, 
                         determine the reciprocal correlation's 
                         connected to the 19th century. Work 
                         24 hours a day if necessary. In the 
                         meantime... one of us will have to 
                         take charge of him.

               She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives 
               her away.

                                     KATE
                         This is a major scientific 
                         opportunity. It doesn't get any better 
                         than this. Imagine. Researching the 
                         behavior, the physical and emotional 
                         characteristics of a century ago! 
                         Utilizing technology available to us 
                         today... He's a gold mine!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.

                                     KATE
                         And while he's here, he's ours. Any 
                         volunteers?

               No one moves.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked 
                         will be responsible. Agreed?

               They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them 
               in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:

                                     DR. KAU
                         I'll do it.

               All the scientists face her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You'll look after him?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No, I meant I'll pick the name.

               She reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally 
               SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat.

                                     KATE
                         Fine.

               Leopold stirs. He blinks at the group.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where...? What has happened?!

               The doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround 
               Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally:

                                     KATE
                         Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee 
                         aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge 
                         research team. A project funded by 
                         the government of the United States.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (regarding their 
                              appearance with 
                              distaste)
                         Oh. Americans. I see...

                                     KATE
                         Yes, um... For the past six and a 
                         half years we've been conducting 
                         scientific experiments on density 
                         and flexibility in the dimensions of 
                         time and space.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came 
                         upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... 
                         particles traveling faster than the 
                         speed of light, which allowed us 
                         to... fold time so to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Yes. Bend it between the cracks of 
                         the dimensions.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yes.

               They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Now, while that wasn't the original 
                         purpose of our experiment, we opted 
                         to pursue it, well, privately, on 
                         our own.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Borrowing funds already provided.

                                     KATE
                         We journeyed to your time because it 
                         was the quickest path to follow. We 
                         debated long and hard whether we 
                         should use this knowledge at all. 
                         Believe me, it was never our intent 
                         to disturb the past...

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Merely to discover if the expedition 
                         were possible. As your presence here 
                         confirms... we are very disturbed.

               Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         The problem facing us is not only 
                         HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you 
                         see?

                                     KATE
                         We certainly don't want to 
                         miscalculate. Send you to a different 
                         era entirely.

               Leopold starts to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Rest assured, no harm will come to 
                         you. You'll be well looked after by 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What 
                         do you mean, get me back home?... 
                         Where am I?

               Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for 
               the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting 
               and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. 
               The doctors are silent.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!...
                              (slowly)
                         Would you have me believe... I am 
                         being detained, at present in the 
                         HEREAFTER?... The time to come?

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (carefully)
                         It is the year nineteen hundred and 
                         ninety-five.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...19...?

               Leopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're insane! All of you! This is 
                         impossible!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Leopold, calm down!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A voyage through time! What do you 
                         take me for? Did you bring me here 
                         by force?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We're scientist, not seditionists.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (truly panicked)
                         Let me out of here! I won't stand 
                         for this another moment!

               He's out the door.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY

               Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit 
               hallway, the doctors close behind.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, wait!

                                     DR. KAU
                         You don't know what you're doing.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Just listen to what we have to say!

               It is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs 
               upstairs.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights. 
               Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car 
               alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all 
               in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         19...?

               The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Kate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto 
               his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter 
               disbelief.

                                     KATE
                         Squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab?

                                     KATE
                         I remember reading they ate a lot of 
                         squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab... Do you have a squab?

                                     KATE
                              (quietly. On the verge 
                              of panic)
                         I don't know!

                                     DR. KAU
                         Pull yourself together!
                              (turning to Leopold)
                         Are you all right back there?

               Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, 
               magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate 
               watches him in her rear view mirror.

                                     KATE
                         You're going to be fine you know. 
                         There's nothing to worry about. I 
                         have everything under control.

               Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly to Dr. Kau)
                         We'll never get away with this.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. 
               His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly 
               rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out 
               on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes 
               his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.

               There is a KNOCK on the door.

               Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of 
               dignity.

                                     KATE
                         How are you feeling?
                              (no response)
                         I thought you might like some tea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I insist on being returned home 
                         immediately.

                                     KATE
                         I understand. We're doing our best.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I wish to speak with your employer, 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You're speaking to him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are not suggesting that you are 
                         Dr. Coles?

               She smiles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss... uh?

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles. If you like, you could 
                         call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's 
                         too much, how about just plain Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (coldly)
                         A WOMAN of science?

                                     KATE
                         Hard to believe?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But a woman's brain cannot obtain 
                         enough knowledge to posses a truly 
                         scientific mind.

                                     KATE
                              (jotting this down)
                         Interesting. Nevertheless, we've 
                         come a long way baby.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (confused)
                         Are you attempting to be humorous?

                                     KATE
                         I'm attempting to be informative 
                         it's just coming out humorous.

               Leopold regards her dubiously.

                                     KATE
                              (clinically)
                         Look, modern social science clearly 
                         states that a woman's place in society 
                         marks the level of that civilization. 
                         A science career for a woman is now 
                         almost as acceptable as being a... 
                         a... waitress. Cream and sugar?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young lady, I... Surely it is not 
                         expected that I remain here with you 
                         indefinitely... Unchaperoned?

                                     KATE
                              (pen poised)
                         Does that make you nervous?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Certainly not!

                                     KATE
                              (writing)
                         Then what are you getting so red 
                         about? It's a very large apartment... 
                         with locks on all the doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The idea! My dear Miss Coles...

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey...

                                     KATE
                              (she puts the pad 
                              down)
                         Let's get one thing straight right 
                         now. My name is Kate or Katherine or 
                         if you insist Dr. Coles.
                              (she rises)
                         Take a good long look, Leopold. I am 
                         a 20th century American woman with a 
                         Doctorate and a commission and 
                         independence. I am not your "young 
                         lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your 
                         "honey." Is that clear?

               Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey... For the tea.

                                     KATE
                         ...I'll get it for you.

               Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard 
               searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear 
               and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries 
               posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the 
               toaster.

               INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

               Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you... Has it been decided 
                         what it is I am to do while I am 
                         being held here?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, 
                         a little light housework...

               Leopold doesn't react.

                                     KATE
                              (clearing her throat)
                         I took the liberty of preparing a 
                         simple schedule to efficiently utilize 
                         your time while incorporating you 
                         into my routine.
                              (she hands him a 
                              schedule)
                         As you can see, my day begins with 
                         meditation and yoga from 6:30 to 
                         7:00.

               She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable.

                                     KATE
                         YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and 
                         change and at 7:15, we breakfast 
                         together. 7:45 we begin the days 
                         work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to 
                         observe you in your natural routine 
                         as I research the data that will 
                         enable you to return home. At 1:15 
                         we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a 
                         daily questionnaire, I type up my 
                         notes. At precisely 6:15 you will 
                         enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then, 
                         at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while 
                         making dinner as YOU write down any 
                         questions that come up during your 
                         day. At 7:00, we dine together. If 
                         you need me at any time you may ring 
                         this bell.

               She rings a tiny dinner bell. He is about to speak.

                                     KATE
                         Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have 
                         computer science class, Tuesdays I 
                         have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm 
                         usually home by 9:15. During these 
                         periods you may read any of the books 
                         I've picked out for you in your room. 
                         I organize my next days work at 10:30, 
                         11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in 
                         bed.
                              (she takes a breath, 
                              smiles at him)
                         Next day we begin again. Simple?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat, with 
                              great dignity)
                         ...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?

               Kate is forced into a stunned silence.

                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                         Kate? I'm home.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your father?

                                     KATE
                         Sort of. My brother.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Visiting?

                                     KATE
                         For the past two years. Charlie can 
                         never know about this project. We'll 
                         tell him you are a... overly 
                         distinguished colleague staying here 
                         as our guest. From Canada. Which 
                         would explain your lack of familiarity 
                         with our customs and so forth

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (aghast)
                         A CANADIAN?

                                     KATE
                         Make yourself comfortable. I'll check 
                         in on you later. I think this is 
                         going very well, don't you?

               Leopold looks at her blankly.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. If you need anything, just 
                         ring.

               Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out. 
               P.O.V. still on Leopold.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                              (shouting)
                         Charlie!

               Leopold reacts.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                              (screaming just as 
                              loud)
                         What?

                                     KATE
                              (still shouting)
                         Come here I wanna talk to you.

               Leopold listens at the door. He slowly opens it, takes two 
               steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back 
               in. He takes a DEEP FRIGHTENED BREATH and slowly deflates.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - MORNING

               Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by 
               his paintings. He is a likable twentysomething with a big 
               mouth.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I do?

                                     KATE
                              (removing his coffee 
                              from the table, 
                              setting it on a 
                              coaster)
                         RINGS! And what did I say about you 
                         smoking in the house?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You were against it.

                                     KATE
                         Correct. You're back early.
                              (She takes away his 
                              cigarette)

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey!... Are you all right? You look 
                         funny.

                                     KATE
                         Funny ha ha or funny odd?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Both.

                                     KATE
                         That all depends. How was your trip?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why?

                                     KATE
                         If it was good I'll tell you the 
                         truth. If it was rotten I'll have to 
                         butter you up first.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Butter me up.

                                     KATE
                         Have you been working out? No, I'm 
                         really starting to see results. Are 
                         you comfortable there on the couch?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Very.

                                     KATE
                         Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there 
                         the next few nights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate!

                                     KATE
                         You have to be out of here by 8 and 
                         you can't be back before 6. We have 
                         an important man working with us 
                         with very unusual needs. The company 
                         is insisting he stay here.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about a hotel?

                                     KATE
                         This man requires around the clock 
                         attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I meant for me.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you, Charlie.
                              (she kisses his 
                              forehead)
                         I owe you one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe me nine. What am I supposed 
                         to do all day?

                                     KATE
                              (as if having an 
                              epiphany)
                         You could get a job!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, the entire point of being an 
                         artist is that I don't have to work. 
                         Who is this guy?

                                     KATE
                         Well, I can't tell you much because...

                                     KATE AND CHARLIE
                         I'm not allowed to discuss what goes 
                         on at the office.

                                     KATE
                         Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be 
                         interesting to have someone else to 
                         talk to. It gets so quiet around 
                         here sometimes I feel like I've gone 
                         deaf.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does he have a label?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his 
                         name?

                                     KATE
                         He's exactly like his name.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then you owe me ten.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. 
               Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up 
               to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright 
               fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to 
               rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. 
               He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button 
               ON.

               Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before 
               an excited crowd.

               Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of 
               him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, 
               slams the power OFF.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Horrible!

               He quickly scurries out the hallway.

               He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, 
               he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he 
               purposefully steps back inside.

               He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted 
               by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. 
               He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly 
               examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.

               He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks 
               the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment 
               in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.

               Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the 
               lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     KATE
                              (explaining)
                         He's from Canada...

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie 
               banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (finally)
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         It's called Hamburger Helper.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is beyond help. Please serve the 
                         next course.

               He pushes his plate away.

                                     KATE
                         I'm afraid there is no next course. 
                         If you make a list of the foods you 
                         like, I'll pick them up at the store 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is all food here this... textured?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mine's good.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please understand, I am used to a 
                         different sort of preparation. Where 
                         I come from a proper meal is the 
                         result of reflection and study. A 
                         recipe is merely a theme which an 
                         intelligent cook can plan each time 
                         with variation.

               Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Several courses are served. Menus 
                         are often prepared days in advance, 
                         timed to perfection. It is said, 
                         without the culinary art, the 
                         crudeness of reality would make life 
                         unbearable.

                                     CHARLIE
                         In Canada?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat. Firmly)
                         In Canada.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We have a saying here. "Shake and 
                         shake the catsup bottle, none will 
                         come and then a lot'll."

               He pours catsup on his dinner.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How interesting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Since you're such an expert on fine 
                         cuisine, why don't you make dinner 
                         tomorrow night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It should be obvious to you that I 
                         am NOT a domestic. You may take my 
                         plate.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have my own, thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who died and made me Cinderella?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young man, there is a distinct 
                         impertinence to your voice.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's part of my charm.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Suppress it.

                                     KATE
                              (changing the subject)
                         Leopold... Since you're our guest 
                         here, there are several cultural 
                         events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie 
                         has season tickets to the ball game. 
                         Perhaps you'd like to take that in?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Or the Opera or the Ballet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, there's no rule that says 
                         everyone has to be interested in 
                         baseball.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, but I believe there is a rule 
                         that says everyone has to have HEARD 
                         of it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, your brother Charles 
                         attitude and demeanor are 
                         unacceptable. If I am to stay on 
                         here you must have a serious talk 
                         with him regarding respect and 
                         civility.

                                     KATE
                         CHARLES, could you help me with the 
                         dessert in the kitchen?

                                     CHARLIE
                         In the kitchen?

                                     KATE
                         IN the kitchen. Excuse us.

               Kate and Charlie leave. The camera remains on Leopold, sitting 
               alone, calmly sipping his wine. VOICE OVER FROM THE KITCHEN:

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't believe this guy!

                                     KATE
                         Try to be nice to him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm always NICE!

                                     KATE
                         Please Charlie, as a favor to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He gives me the creeps.

               Leopold reacts. He listens self-consciously.

                                     KATE
                         He's different that's all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What was that crack about domestics?

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, this is important to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not going out with him, are 
                         you?

                                     KATE
                         Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm 
                         not a lost cause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys 
                         you bring home.

                                     KATE
                         I've done countless favors for you! 
                         Now I'm asking for just one little 
                         thing...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (overlapping)
                         Oh, all right! All right! All right!

               They emerge from the kitchen, beaming.

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         We forgot the dessert.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know,... I don't know if I 
                         mentioned it... but that is one fine 
                         looking suit.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - 6:30 A. M.

               Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to 
               sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." Dressed in yoga 
               clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs 
               the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings. Kate flinches 
               but does not open her eyes.

                                     KATE
                              (too sweetly)
                         What is it, Leopold?

               The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine.

                                     KATE
                              (eyes closed, screaming 
                              like a fishwife)
                         WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!

               Leopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed 
               and out of the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing 
               a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the 
               blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is 
               BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every 
               cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly amidst the 
                              chaos)
                         I cannot seem to find the tea...

               CLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open 
               closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No... No... No. Good God, no!... 
                         Perhaps...

               He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell.

               INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks 
               her schedule and bangs on the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your time is up! What's he 
                         got, a girl in there?

               INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap" 
               marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He 
               picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. 
               It SPRAYS.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He 
               discovers the clapper has been stolen.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks 
               up and stops suddenly.

               Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of 
               Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, 
               bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses 
               foppishly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I should like to read about modern 
                         currency during my bath tonight. See 
                         that the tub and basin are scrubbed 
                         up. Remnants remain of this afternoons 
                         shave.

               Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of 
               clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing 
               skis.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds.

               INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

               He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. 
               Each are wearing a walkman.

               He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously 
               until they look up.

               INT. STUDY - DAY

               Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian 
               customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. 
               A beat.

               Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles 
               papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. 
               She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty 
               room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, 
               she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the 
               window and looks out.

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the 
               brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. 
               He moves to the window and looks out.

               EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly 
               pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.

                                     KATE
                         In our last session you intimated 
                         there was a symmetrical system 
                         regulating the social order of 
                         conformity spanning your era. I found 
                         this particularly intriguing If I 
                         can just find it in my notes...

               A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then 
               turns back, excited.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fire brigade!

               Kate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks 
               water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is insufferable! I refuse to be 
                         spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled 
                         about any longer. I have yet to 
                         venture outside this cell. Before I 
                         go mad a more suitable arrangement 
                         must be found.

                                     KATE
                         Found it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (startled)
                         A resolution?

                                     KATE
                         No I meant I found my notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.

                                     KATE
                         I can hear you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (under control now)
                         Miss Coles, as we are to remain here 
                         together, there are certain conditions 
                         I insist are met and maintained. I 
                         no longer wish to be peeped at, 
                         mocked...

                                     KATE
                         I never...

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly)
                         Or interrupted. Jot this down. 
                         Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner 
                         at 8. A horse should be made available 
                         from 1 to 3.

                                     KATE
                         A horse? In New York City?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about 
                         your style of dress. I do not care 
                         for it.
                              (Kate looks up)
                         I cannot believe it is the prevailing 
                         taste for women to appear masculine 
                         and unkempt. If this is the fashion, 
                         have it altered.

               Kate rises.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That is all for the present.

               He grandly hands her a napkin.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         CRUMBS, my dear!

                                     KATE
                              (infuriated)
                         Thank you!

               Brushing herself off, she heads to the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted 
                         with many women in my time, yet I am 
                         compelled to say that the modern 
                         woman is by far the least attractive 
                         I have ever encountered.

                                     KATE
                              (rising to the occasion)
                         And I have a news flash of my own.

               Leopold waits.

                                     KATE
                         You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!

               She storms out.

               INT. LAB - EARLY MORNING

               Dr. Drake enters Dr. Kau's office with two pints of Haagen 
               Dazs.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough 
                         Swirl or Peach?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Peach.

               They dig in.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Any luck?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No 
                         information exists detailing what 
                         happened to Carlson. I've been working 
                         for weeks and I'm not any closer 
                         than when I began... How are you 
                         doing?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         My cholesterol level is up 70 points.

               Kate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr. 
               Drake's desk. Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through 
               her hair, and in her mouth.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Thank you, Kate... How're you managing 
                         with Leopold?

                                     KATE
                         Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Nothing. I was just asking.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight. 
                         Everything's under control.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Keep up the good work.
                              (after she's gone)
                         She seemed a little scattered. Do 
                         you think everything's all right?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Katherine Coles is the most capable 
                         person we have on this project. If 
                         anyone can handle the delicacy of 
                         this situation, Kate can.

                                     DR. KAU
                         So there's nothing to worry about?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Absolutely not.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

                                     KATE
                         GONE? GONE WHERE?!
                              (Charlie shrugs)
                         Charlie we've got to find him!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (working on a VERY 
                              STERN portrait of 
                              Kate at her computer)
                         Are you crazy? This is the first 
                         time all week my eyes aren't darting 
                         to the top of my sockets every five 
                         minutes.

                                     KATE
                         When did he leave?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know. An hour ago? He said 
                         he wanted to take a walk.

                                     KATE
                         And you let him?? He's not allowed 
                         to go outside!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is he being punished?

                                     KATE
                         We've got to find him! You stay here 
                         in case he finds his way back. And 
                         while you wait you'd better pray 
                         he's all right. If anything happens 
                         to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING 
                         we've worked for will have been 
                         destroyed.

               She heads out the door. Charlie follows.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, calm down.

                                     KATE
                         And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?
                              (she grabs her coat 
                              and purse)

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's the big deal? Who is this 
                         guy?

               Kate takes a LONG pause.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold... is not really from Canada.

               EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON

               Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. 
               Suddenly:

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         OH MY GOD!!!

               The pigeons take flight.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING

               Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both 
               ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING 
               brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, 
               caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. 
               A motorist pulls along side of him.

                                     WOMAN MOTORIST
                         You stupid fucking son of a bitch. 
                         Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.

               Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads 
               into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears.

               INT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT

               Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with 
               mounting anger.

                                     CABBY
                         What're ya waiting for lady? An 
                         invitation?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

               She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm.

               EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

               Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. 
               Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled 
               BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He 
               enters a deli.

               INT. DELI - NIGHT

               Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has 
               none.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the counter man)
                         $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You gotta problem with that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It seems rather pricey to me.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So don't buy one.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shan't.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So shan't!

               He moves on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, I... I would be happy to sample 
                         one however I'm afraid I haven't the 
                         finance with me just now. If I could 
                         establish a credit with you, I will 
                         have someone come round with the 
                         funds tomorrow.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a 
                         hamburger today, is that it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little confused)
                         I believe so. Yes.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Get the fuck outta here.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I remind you, merchant, that I 
                         am the customer in this establishment 
                         and as such require your attention 
                         and the utmost respect. I do not 
                         accept this modern convention of 
                         desecrating one's patrons with such 
                         contemptuous disregard.

                                     YUPPIE WOMAN
                         You tell him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Need I add that without our patronage 
                         you would not own that unwashed 
                         counter behind which you spew your 
                         filthy mouth?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Where do you get off? You don't even 
                         have any money.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Not in my store you're not.

               He comes out from behind the counter. He's big.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very superior)
                         Do you intend to physically escort 
                         me out...?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Did you see what he did? Did you see 
                         that?

               No one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. 
               Thunder is heard.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT

               Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, 
               Alphabet City.

               EXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M.

               Pouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten 
               and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and 
               hastily backs up along side Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Leopold, get in.

               Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and 
               helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat.

               INT. CAR - 4 A.M.

                                     KATE
                              (nearly in tears, 
                              trying to dry him 
                              off)
                         Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're 
                         all right. I didn't think I'd ever 
                         find you. You had us all so worried. 
                         Oh, Leopold!

               She hits him hard.

                                     KATE
                         Don't you ever go out again without 
                         my permission, do you hear me? I was 
                         frantic. You could have been killed 
                         a hundred times over. I never would 
                         have known.

               She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She 
               pulls herself together and looks at him.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, are you all right?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (looking deep into 
                              her eyes for the 
                              first time)
                         I wish to go home.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (badly shaken)
                         No... I wish to go home.

               Kate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight 
               ahead.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                     CHARLIE
                              (on the phone)
                         I don't know. It's just Leopold. 
                         Like Cher. Or Goofy.

               Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. 
                         You look horrible.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, don't start. I haven't been 
                         this angry at you since you got me 
                         into that pyramid thing last year. 
                         If you make a wisecrack I'm going to 
                         burst into flame.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look 
                         horrible.

                                     KATE
                         I'm too tired for this now. I'll 
                         just save it up and kill you tomorrow. 
                         Help Leopold out of his things and 
                         lets get him to bed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I've something to say. To the both 
                         of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. 
                         After witnessing mere weeks of this 
                         age it is painfully apparent I am 
                         outside of my acquaintance... I don't 
                         know how to proceed. I frankly... am 
                         in need of assistance. I'm sorry. 
                         I'm not very good at this. In the 
                         event you have missed it, I am 
                         apologizing.

               There is a long pause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         About time.
                              (he shakes Leopold's 
                              hand reluctantly)
                         Welcome back.
                              (he leaves)

                                     KATE
                         Don't mind him. His heart would be 
                         in the right place if he had a heart. 
                         Surliness runs in my family.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand. It practically races 
                         through mine.

                                     KATE
                              (shocked)
                         Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one 
                         that's not at my expense. That's 
                         good.

               They look at each other just a second too long.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We'd better get to bed... That is...

                                     KATE
                         Yes... I start work...
                              (she looks at her 
                              watch)
                         in three and a half hours.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, dear.

               They self-consciously head to their respective rooms.

                                     KATE
                         It's fine. I'm used to it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You mustn't get too used to it. You'll 
                         find life passes you by awfully 
                         quickly.

               Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and 
               is moved. She catches herself quickly however.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you for...

                                     KATE
                              (waving it away)
                         Oh!

               They stand at their bedroom doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, goodnight then.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?... I don't have a clear 
                         handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong 
                         keeping you confined to the apartment 
                         all this time. I don't know when 
                         you'll be able return home... Tomorrow 
                         I'll start preparing you for the 
                         outside world. And... We'll find 
                         your way back. I promise.

               Leopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the 
               doors to their respective rooms.

               INT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING

               Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         Yes?

               Leopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at 
               Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was 
                         merely... I didn't...

                                     KATE
                         Is there something you want, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I merely wanted to see... that is, 
                         inquire, on your availability, for 
                         an outing... My assimilation and so 
                         forth.

                                     KATE
                         Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of 
                         us. I'll be out in a minute.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, of course. Splendid.

               He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob. 
               He finally finds it and goes out.

               Kate smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller 
               Center, 5th Avenue.

               EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY

               Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip 
               Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you certain this is correct?

               Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods 
               approvingly.

                                     KATE
                         Certainly I'm certain.

               Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend 
               it. Kate leads him into Barney's.

               INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

               Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit. 
               He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now really. Isn't this better?

               Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes.

               INT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY

               Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               Kate walks ahead. Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken 
               wheel, hasn't the knack and bangs into everyone and everything 
               in the aisle.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UPS: Leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans, cereals 
               for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene 
               supplies.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The check out line. As their groceries are being rung up, 
               Leopold spots The Sun, a newspaper with the headline: Woman 
               Sees Satan in her Microwave Oven. Leopold eagerly shows Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you seen today's paper?

                                     KATE
                         Put it back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Back!

               Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm. 
               Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, why is it you are not 
                         married?

                                     KATE
                         Women are longer defined by the men 
                         they're married to, Leopold. I have 
                         a career. I haven't found a man who 
                         fits in with that yet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yet people still marry?

                                     KATE
                              (defensively)
                         I've heard of cases.

               They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate. 
               Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suspect there is something wrong 
                         with you.

                                     KATE
                         There's nothing wrong with me!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps it is the way you present 
                         yourself.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         There is some sort of problem when a 
                         woman reaches thirty and insists on 
                         remaining single.

                                     KATE
                         You think I'm THIRTY?!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         Do I look THIRTY to you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was an arbitrary number.

                                     KATE
                         You chose it specifically opposed to 
                         a lower number.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I didn't mean it.

                                     KATE
                         ...Thirty!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I apologize... How old are you?

                                     KATE
                              (sharply)
                         I'm thirty! But you're the first 
                         person whoever told me I looked it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm sorry.

               Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a 
               good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside. 
               Kate continues down the block.

                                     KATE
                         And it's not that I insist on 
                         remaining single. Believe me. Everyone 
                         dreams of finding somebody to share 
                         their life with. To give someone all 
                         the love they've been hoarding since 
                         they were a kid. I'm no different. 
                         But one has to be sensible. I have a 
                         career and a life that's filled 
                         with...

               She looks around. Leopold is gone.

                                     KATE
                         Not again...

               She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ROBERTA'S, 
               an upscale boutique.

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               Kate races in. Leopold talks with a saleslady.

                                     KATE
                         What do I have to do? Put a leash 
                         around your neck?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the saleslady)
                         She is the woman to whom I was 
                         referring. You see the problem?

                                     SALESLADY
                              (giving Kate the once 
                              over)
                         Yep.

                                     KATE
                              (staring down at her 
                              clothes then back at 
                              the two of them)
                         What?... What?

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others 
               with irritation.

                                     KATE
                         This is ridiculous. I don't have 
                         time to...
                              (she shrieks)
                         Do you know what this dress costs? 
                         Let's get this over with. I'm coming 
                         out. Nobody laugh.

               Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE 
               that she is STUNNING.

                                     KATE
                         Satisfied?

               Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.

                                     KATE
                         ...What?

               She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands 
               behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You have a lovely face.

               Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at 
               herself for a long while.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (quietly)
                         We'll take the dress.

               They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously 
               part.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and 
               hands him the remote control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         The drug of the 20th century.

               She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's 
               spellbound.

               INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits 
               on the sofa watching the TV.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm coming.

               He does not move a muscle.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and 
               watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys 
               this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold 
               grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.

                                     KATE
                              (making notes)
                         It's a guy thing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. 
               Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. 
               She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to 
               capture a better look at his face.

               After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand 
               and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. 
               Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She 
               looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.

               Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to 
               the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly 
               mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.

               She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins 
               pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.

               INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes 
               area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and 
               several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for 
               solutions.

                                     KATE
                         ...Now within that astronomical 
                         structure, Dr. Drake here is searching 
                         for a pathway between your time and 
                         the present. He'll find it too if 
                         his arteries don't harden first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Astounding.

                                     KATE
                         Once that is discovered, the search 
                         begins for the exact time and date 
                         travel will be possible.

               They move to Dr. Kau's area.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Dr. Kau)
                         How are you proceeding?

               Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Don't take it personally. Once Dr. 
                         Kau starts working, you just have to 
                         wait until her batteries run down. 
                         We're all pretty much like that.

               They head into Kate's office.

               INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The complexity of this equation is 
                         astonishing? Can you really comprehend 
                         all that?

                                     KATE
                              (simply. Almost 
                              apologetically)
                         I'm a genius.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.
                              (a beat)
                         That is to say, you all are.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you. And may I say that 
                         sometimes, in DIM light, you're not 
                         so bad yourself.

               They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.

                                     KATE
                         Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm 
                         late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I accompany you?

                                     KATE
                         You mayn't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am not certain I understand therapy.

                                     KATE
                         No one does. That's why therapists 
                         can charge so much.

               As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high 
               heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What exactly transpires during 
                         therapy?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold. A gentleman does not ask 
                         those questions. Come on, we'll get 
                         you home.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am perfectly able to travel homeward 
                         myself.

               Kate looks at him skeptically.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Really! I have finance and our 
                         address. I shall take a cabbie.

               Kate hesitates.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are late. I insist. I am NOT a 
                         child. Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         All right. Don't bite my head off.

               She shakes her head and walks out the door.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet 
               behind, Leopold cautiously follows.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR

               Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, 
               grimaces noticeably at the smell.

               Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into 
               the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.

               He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around 
               to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands 
               NOSE to NOSE with the nun.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't seem to...

                                     NUN
                              (impatiently)
                         Oh, for heaven's sake...

               The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as 
               the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.

               He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in 
               the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly 
               against the glass.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING

               Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray 
               Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a 
               distance.

               INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING

               Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on 
               the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of 
               breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.

                                     MRS. PINCUS
                         I was worried. I thought you weren't 
                         going to make it.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling happily)
                         Miss my lesson? This is the only 
                         thing I have to look forward to all 
                         week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?

               Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her 
               purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.

               An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps 
               her hands together loudly.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         All right, kids. Pair up!

               The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their 
               gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying 
               the floor.

               The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick 
               their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, 
               elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while 
               Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music 
               plays.

               The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate 
               dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a 
               beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING 
               look spread across her face.

               The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the 
                         music.

                                     KATE
                              (sweating)
                         I am!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Dancing should not be work. It should 
                         be a vacation the body takes from 
                         the mind. Let the music wash over 
                         you.

                              (frustrated)
                         It is!

                         Repeat after me: I've got the muusic 
                         in me.

                                     KATE
                         I've got the muusic in me.

                                     INSTRUCTOR & KATE
                              (overlapping)
                         I've got the muusic in me!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Keep telling yourself that.

               Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.

               Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.

               LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling 
               couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her 
               imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, 
               muttering to herself, dancing alone.

               INT. LAB - MORNING

               Dr. Kau SLAMS a large book on Dr. Plodder's desk startling 
               him.

                                     DR. KAU
                         I've located her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You didn't! Is she all right?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No. She's really not.

               Photograph of a SWEATSHOP 1896. The conditions are APPALLING. 
               Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, 
               worn out, stares helplessly into the camera.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It was taken a year after she arrived. 
                         Look at her face! We have to get her 
                         back.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Christine, this morning I spoke with 
                         the head of funding. They're talking 
                         about canceling the project.

                                     DR. KAU
                         What?! They can't do that!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         There's still time. Nothing has 
                         happened yet that can't be undone. 
                         We'll get her back. We'll put this 
                         behind us and we'll get her back.

               The doctors stare at the photograph. Powerless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold work at their easels. Leopold sighs 
               HEAVILY.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is there something on your mind?

               There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is rather difficult for me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         ...Uh huh...?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have been in the salon contemplating 
                         the reception I have received by the 
                         various tradesmen I have visited. 
                         I've determined I am lacking the 
                         dexterity of modern intercourse.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Of what??

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Social skills.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I realize our association has been 
                         rather distant and I bear you no ill 
                         will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can imagine my relief.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fact is... I need help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I would appreciate the masculine 
                         point of view.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.

               Leopold looks worried. Charlie puts down his brush.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? Let's see... I guess we could 
                         start by removing that great big 
                         stick from up your... Let's start 
                         with your walk.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My walk?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't walk right.
                              (gently)
                         You strut.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very defensive)
                         STRUT?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Strut strut strut. You walk into the 
                         bathroom it's like I'm watching a 
                         parade. Walk across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You 
                         asked for my help. Trust me on this.

               As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head 
               and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes 
               March. Leopold becomes more and more agitated. As the song 
               crescendos:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That's enough! Really! You walk.

               Charlie hops up, casually walks around the room and begins 
               to hum a more relaxed version of Stars and Stripes.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (between choruses)
                         See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.

               Leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song 
               and mimics Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's better. Now, try to enjoy 
                         your walk. It's a beautiful day. The 
                         sun is shining, the peasants are 
                         singing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               VOICE OVER: Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The Stars 
               and Stripes. As the song builds:

               Charlie enters leading Leopold throughout the room. Leopold 
               matches Charlie EXACTLY step by step so tightly they appear 
               to be one person marching happily about.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Chinatown, Little Italy, chess in Washington Square Park.

               EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

               Leopold and Charlie explore the city. Leopold works diligently 
               on his walk. A beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit. 
               Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Interesting?

               Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles. 
               Charlie pats Leopold on the back. Stops. Pats his back again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, are you wearing a corset?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Naturally.

               Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around 
               Leopold's shoulder. Leopold attempts the same pulls away.

               INT. BLOCKBUSTER RECORDS - NIGHT

               With a headset on, Charlie listens to music. Leopold watches.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What'd ya say was the name of this 
                         number?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty.

               Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's 
               ears. Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song. 
               Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears. His mouth 
               opens wide.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.

               After a bit, Charlie turns the music off. Leopold's shoulders 
               go down but his mouth stays wide open. Astonished.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball 
               hits Leopold squarely on the head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What in the world...?

               A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE. 
               Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.

                                     MAN
                         Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?

                                     WOMAN
                         She's another Babe Ruth. We had no 
                         idea. Are you okay?

               Leopold regards them curiously.

                                     WOMAN
                         What do you have to say for yourself, 
                         Elizabeth?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm sorry!

               Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't 
               speak. After a long moment:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is this your child?

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

               Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at 
               Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     WOMAN
                         C'mon honey, lets go.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I want my ball.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just a moment!
                              (bending down to 
                              Elizabeth, firmly)
                         Pick a hand.

               She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. 
               Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from 
               his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My mother's name was Elizabeth.
                              (then to her parents)
                         She's a beautiful child. You're very 
                         lucky.

                                     MAN
                         What do you say, Elizabeth?

               Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face.

                                     MAN
                         Thank you.

               Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost 
               in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza 
               pies, and pot pies.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand pumpkin pies, pizza 
                         pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone 
                         would explain Eskimo pies.

               He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange 
               a worried look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You smoke Camel's, you wear Old 
                         Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew. 
                         It's revolting.
                              (to Kate)
                         The pudding tonight is excellent. 
                         Another thing I've noticed, everyone 
                         is in a great rush today. Instant 
                         Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, 
                         Minute Maid. You'll find there's 
                         much to be said for moderation and 
                         languor.

               He eats another spoonful.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Mmmm. Is it tapioca?

                                     KATE
                         It's margarine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking the spoon out 
                              of his mouth)
                         It's marvelous.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     KATE
                         Me too. Work to do. Where are you 
                         going?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine. 
                         It's this coffee house we go to.

                                     KATE
                         Say hello to Dennis for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dennis is this really good looking 
                         friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's 
                         alive because SHE doesn't know how 
                         to flirt.

                                     KATE
                         As a rule I don't like to associate 
                         with really good looking people. It 
                         makes me feel really... I don't 
                         know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice 
                         guy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And he always picks up the check.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         That's a wonderful idea! Leopold 
                         mentioned how he wanted to meet... 
                         People of quality was it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ahhhhh?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         If you'd rather I didn't go...

                                     KATE
                         Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to 
                         hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going 
                         to think you don't want him to go.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh it's not that. It's just that 
                         it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. 
                         I'm not sure you'd have such a good 
                         time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A little ribald humor? I'm not as 
                         big a stick in the mud as you might 
                         think! I'd enjoy a gay night out, 
                         kicking up my heels.

               There is an awkward pause. Leopold is so enthusiastic and 
               sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Finish off your Parquet and we'll 
                         go.

               Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house. 
               Charlie looks in the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There they all are. Now one more 
                         thing. Throw the words "like" and 
                         "you know" into a sentence whenever 
                         possible. It's how people talk today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Proper speech does not cease to exist 
                         simply because it is ignored.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Please?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles, you needn't fret. I have 
                         the walk down pat. I will not give 
                         myself away. Like.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looking in the window)
                         Oh shit!
                              (correcting himself)
                         Shoot.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Patrice. See that girl? The blonde 
                         one? She's so inconceivably hot.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Patrice, a tall blonde sits at a large round table, talking. 
               She is very beautiful.

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         She's very pretty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She's mine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Congratulations.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her 
                         first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay. I guess we should go in. I 
                         don't suppose we could tell everyone 
                         you don't speak English?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course not. Let's go inside.

               Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very 
               reluctant Charlie.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie's friends are sitting at a table talking. They are a 
               relaxed and friendly group. Charlie and Leopold approach.

                                     ALL
                              (ad lib greetings)
                         Charlie! Where've you been? etc.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend, 
                         Leo.

                                     BILL
                         Hey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Hey.

                                     DENNIS
                         Waz up?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Waz up?

                                     PATRICE
                         How are ya?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How are ya?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a beat)
                         Leo's staying with us for a while.

               Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next 
               to Patrice instead. Patrice takes out her cigarettes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I?

                                     PATRICE
                         Help yourself.

               Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his 
               own.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you, my dear.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (at a loss)
                         Um?...
                              (all look at Charlie)
                         ...I have nothing to say.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You did not tell the truth about 
                         Patrice, Charles.

                                     DENNIS AND BILL
                         CHARLES??

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I tell you, LEO?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         He informed me you were inconceivably 
                         HOT, but I think you're lovely. 
                         Exceptionally lovely.

                                     PATRICE
                         Thank you, Leo.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to the waitress)
                         Check please.

               INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

               The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and 
               the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the 
               fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the 
               same bench.

               Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at 
               Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Just drop it Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I 
                         am not interested in her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hah!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         In any case the problem is not with 
                         me but with you.
                              (quietly)
                         You have no idea what it takes to go 
                         about courting a woman. From what 
                         I've witnessed tonight, it is 
                         symptomatic of your entire generation.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (almost speechless)
                         You are some piece of work, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now I do not wish to get personal...

               Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old 
               woman. She rolls her eyes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But you have been of great assistance 
                         to me and I feel this is one area 
                         where I can be of some real help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm fascinated. Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now, why was I successful with this 
                         young lady and why did you so 
                         miserably fail?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What makes you think she likes you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well she gave me the number of her 
                         telephone and I assumed it meant...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         As I see it, the girl hasn't an 
                         inkling of your intentions. And it's 
                         no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry 
                         Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A what?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A Merry Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I am not!!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Everything plays like a farce to 
                         you. The more wit, the less courage. 
                         I believe the modern woman desires 
                         passion, protection, sensitivity. No 
                         woman wants to be romanced by a 
                         buffoon.
                              (the old woman shakes 
                              her head)
                         Banter and repartee are fine but you 
                         must add to that a different sort of 
                         playfulness.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think I should pounce?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm saying you must treat her with 
                         respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude 
                         pass. A woman of Kate's stature would 
                         never respond to an artificial tactic.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You said Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I did not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?

               The old woman nods.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We are discussing your problem.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not anymore. You like my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles...

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has trouble with men, you know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she has not met the right 
                         one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has met the right one. HUNDREDS 
                         of times. But she pulls back. She 
                         cuts herself off. You turn around 
                         and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         One never can tell.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does Kate know how you feel?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Have you made your intentions known 
                         to her?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think 
                         you're all talk and no action. What 
                         are you waiting for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I do not know if there is a future 
                         in it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well Leopold, no one ever does...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. 
               She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his 
               closet.

               A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the 
               bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of 
               the bed and starts to read.

                                     KATE
                              (reading out loud)
                         Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out -- 
                         slow soulful kissing... Woman as 
                         equals??

               She flips a page.

                                     KATE
                         Who drove the Chevy to the levy and 
                         why was it dry?

               Kate smiles. She flips the page.

                                     KATE
                         Eyes shine when she talks about... 
                         science. Raises her voice when she 
                         knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, 
                         BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when 
                         I see her smile. Most beautiful when 
                         she's angry. Honorable heart... 
                         Peasant feet.

               The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the 
               notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; 
               glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries 
               from the room.

               INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as 
               Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close 
               together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.

                                     KATE
                         Ooops. Bread and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What's that?

                                     KATE
                         Bread and butter. It's an old 
                         saying... Well not to you I guess. 
                         You say it when you pass someone in 
                         a cramped space. As close as bread 
                         and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         So. Did you have a good time last 
                         night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was very interesting.

                                     KATE
                         Did you find that person of quality?

               Leopold looks at her a moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. I did.

                                     KATE
                         Well... fine.
                              (there is a pause)
                         I guess it's time to turn in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate?

               She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of 
               inaction returns.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodnight.
                              (he slowly closes the 
                              door)

               INT. PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He 
               looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie 
               knocks. She opens the door.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. I brought you some flowers.

               He hands her the flower filled painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         Charlie!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering 
                         if you would do me the great honor 
                         of accompanying me to the cinema 
                         tonight. And allowing me the privilege 
                         of escorting you to dinner afterwards.

               Patrice shyly studies the painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         It's beautiful.

               Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does 
               not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Gracing me with your conversation 
                         and company would mean the world to 
                         me.

               There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.

                                     PATRICE
                         Um... 7:00?

                                     CHARLIE
                         7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.

               They smile at each other for a long moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (silently mouthing)
                         Goodbye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goodbye.
                              (she closes the door)
                         It worked!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course it did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea 
                         what to do next!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles. Leave everything to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast, buddy. You're next.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time 
               and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and 
               doesn't know how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

                                     KATE
                         Good morning. You're up early.

               She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. 
               Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out 
               her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side 
               immediately.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm terribly sorry!!

                                     KATE
                         Happens all the time...

               She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her 
               computer. There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was 
                         wondering...

               She stops working and looks at Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What it is you're working on.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. It's my computer.

               She resumes her work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Actually I meant the work 
                         itself.

                                     KATE
                         I'm researching the correlations 
                         between your time and the present.

               Leopold stares blankly.

                                     KATE
                         I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh.

               Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have never seen a woman work as 
                         diligently and extensively before.

                                     KATE
                         It's made me the man I am today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite a beautiful day, have you 
                         noticed? Perhaps you would permit 
                         yourself some time off and grant me 
                         the privilege of escorting you around 
                         the city this fine Spring afternoon.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've 
                         got too much work to do. Ask Charlie 
                         though. He'll go with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the 
                         same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.

               Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold.

                                     KATE
                              (gently)
                         Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Some other time then.

                                     KATE
                         Yes... Thank you.

               Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment 
               then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. 
               After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with 
               her foot and starts banging on the top of it.

                                     KATE
                         Oh for crying out loud. Would you 
                         look at this? Leopold? The computer's 
                         on the blink again.
                              (she bangs harder)
                         Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Maybe if you...

                                     KATE
                         NO, no, it does this all the time. 
                         Just have to wait it out.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         Darn.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...Perhaps it is a sign?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you think?
                              (she smiles at Leopold)

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate 
               follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.

                                     KATE
                         I... I must have gotten a funny 
                         horse...

               Leopold turns and rides around Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in 
               Sheeps Meadow.

               Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps 
               Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse 
               through the greenery of Central Park.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY

               A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring 
               Ronald Coleman.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

               Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large 
               drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.

               The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He 
               involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's 
               shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that supposed to be my hair? Do 
                         you see how they think my hair looks?

               Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she 
               too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close 
               to him.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza, 
               The Metropolitan Museum.

               EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - DAY

               Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.

               INT. MUSEUM - DAY

               Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white 
               canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.

                                     KATE
                         That's simplicity in it's purest 
                         form. It speaks volumes in it's 
                         nothingness. Whiteness representing 
                         emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak. 
                         Bleak!

               Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next 
               object d'art. A toilet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Aaand this represents...?

               They burst into giddy laughter.

                                     KATE
                         Absolutely nothing.

               They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's 
               smile fades.

               CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.

               Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very quietly)
                         I'd almost forgotten how beautiful 
                         it was. Truly. Beautiful.

               Kate smiles sadly at Leopold. They slowly walk out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as Kate and 
               Leopold enter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (laughing)
                         M & M's, CBS, FBI.

                                     KATE
                         VIP, VHS, VCR.

               They collapse on the couch.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know. K.D. Lang.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I don't know how you keep up with 
                         it. I'm exhausted.

                                     KATE
                         So am I.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll tell you what. Why don't I 
                         prepare dinner tomorrow night? I 
                         never have before. I mean even before 
                         I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I 
                         can't imagine what it'll taste like, 
                         but I don't think it will be any 
                         worse than your cooking.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         A blind date.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, I'm so sorry.

                                     KATE
                         No, that just means I haven't met 
                         him before. It was set up through 
                         friends.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah!

                                     KATE
                         A hazard of single life... I'm turning 
                         in.

               Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Another time then.

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite all right.

               As she gets to the door, she stops.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. 
                         I can't remember the last time I 
                         took the day off and just played. 
                         I'd forgotten how beautiful this 
                         city can be... I want to thank you 
                         for that.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The pleasure was mine.

               Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining 
               room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs 
               into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. 
                         Are you sure you can teach me 
                         everything there is to know?

                                     KATE
                              (from the bathroom)
                         Just don't swipe the silverware and 
                         give yourself away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nobody's talking to you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is very simple. I will be your 
                         date. Just behave as you normally 
                         would and I'll correct you along the 
                         way. Now, escort me in.

               Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, 
               Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. 
               Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom 
               in a tight BLACK dress.

               Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie 
               sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now what?

               Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. 
               Hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         No name calling.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Well, really!

               Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, 
               Charlie pushes the chair in to hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're not shoveling coal into a 
                         furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in 
                         gently. Gently. Try it again.

               Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains 
               standing, not sure what to do next.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, sit down!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now don't burst a vein or anything, 
                         but there are quite a few knives and 
                         forks here. How do I know what each 
                         one's for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Merely start from the outside and 
                         work your way in.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What kind of beer should I order?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Beer!

                                     CHARLIE
                         I WAS KIDDING!

                                     KATE
                         How do I look?

               Leopold and Charlie stand. Kate poses in the gown picked out 
               by Leopold. Leopold smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You look exquisite, Katherine.

                                     KATE
                              (almost sadly)
                         Thank you, Leopold.

               She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is a tie I'm wearing.

                                     KATE
                         You look very nice, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. I know.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     KATE
                         That must be him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your bland date?

                                     KATE
                         Blind date.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't 
                         use to many big words. You'll scare 
                         the poor slob away.

                                     KATE
                              (moving to the door)
                         This is always the scary part.
                              (she sings)
                         "Open the door to my, Mystery Date."

               She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie 
               peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands 
               LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner.

                                     LARRY
                         Hi. Kate?

                                     KATE
                         Larry?

               Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile.

                                     KATE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (giving Larry the 
                              once over)
                         Kate, may I have a word with you?

                                     KATE
                         Now?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.
                              (as they cross the 
                              room)
                         I DON'T like the look of him.

                                     KATE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Cad. I can spot one a mile away.
                              (he helps her with 
                              her coat)
                         I shall escort you out myself. I 
                         will act as your chaperone.

                                     KATE
                         That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is no trouble.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She is gone. Leopold stares after her, dejected.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are led to their table. Larry sits down. Kate 
               remains standing.

                                     LARRY
                              (friendly)
                         Sit down.

                                     KATE
                              (sighs)
                         Thank you.
                              (she sits)

                                     LARRY
                         So. How am I doing?

                                     KATE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     LARRY
                         How am I doing? First date. You 
                         pleased? You disappointed?

                                     KATE
                         Undecided.

                                     LARRY
                         I see.

               He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling 
               Kate. She laughs nervously.

                                     LARRY
                         So. What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     KATE
                         About you? Ah, she said you were 
                         tall.

                                     LARRY
                         6'3.

                                     KATE
                         And nice looking.

                                     LARRY
                         Thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Thank her. And that you persevere 
                         ardently on Wall Street.

                                     LARRY
                         Well, I work there...

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         That must be very interesting.

                                     LARRY
                              (laughing)
                         You've obviously never worked on 
                         Wall Street.

                                     KATE
                              (laughing along for 
                              the hell of it)
                         No.

               Their laughter subsides. After a beat:

                                     LARRY
                         What else did Jeannie say about me?

               INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT

               The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie 
               and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go 
               first just as Leopold has instructed.

               The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a 
               look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the 
               table and takes his seat.

                                     PATRICE
                         Have I told you how much I liked 
                         your painting?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (beaming)
                         Twice.

                                     PATRICE
                         If you get tired of hearing about 
                         it, let me know. I have to admit I 
                         was sort of surprised when you called. 
                         I didn't think you liked me, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When I first saw you, I thought...
                              (he makes his jaw 
                              drop down to the 
                              floor)

                                     PATRICE
                         What do you think now?

               Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he 
               makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are eating their dinner.

                                     KATE
                         Aaand that's about all Jeannie said. 
                         What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     LARRY
                              (smiling)
                         She said you were enormously sexy, 
                         had a great body, but you don't put 
                         out.

                                     KATE
                         Quite a compelling portrait.

                                     LARRY
                              (turning on the charm)
                         Would you say it's an accurate 
                         portrait?

                                     KATE
                              (leaning into Larry)
                         A masterpiece.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room 
               table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while 
               he pours a glass of wine.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.

                                     LARRY
                         So this guy wants to invest $50,000 
                         in a stock that's no good. Here's 
                         what I do...

               Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. 
               She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the 
               proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices 
               her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins 
               to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long 
               while. Finally she looks up at Larry.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY

                                     LARRY
                         I'm telling you the guy was a DICK! 
                         A total ASSHOLE!

                                     KATE
                              (jarred awake)
                         Who?

                                     LARRY
                         Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking 
                         about. Hello?

                                     KATE
                              (realizing her feelings 
                              for Leopold, smiling 
                              radiantly at Larry)
                         Goodbye.

               Then as she leaves, a parting shot.

                                     KATE
                         Don't get up.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living 
               room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               His bedroom is empty. He is not there.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.

               Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of 
               Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. 
               She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is 
               touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Oh!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Bread and butter.

               He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, 
               inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're back early. Did you enjoy 
                         your date?

                                     KATE
                              (happily)
                         No.

               She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.

                                     KATE
                         Here, you've got some...

               He wipes his face making it much worse.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is it gone?

                                     KATE
                              (laughing)
                         No.

               She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each 
               other and become serious.

                                     KATE
                              (softly)
                         A funny thing happened to me on my 
                         bland date this evening, Leopold. I 
                         really can't explain it. This puffed-
                         up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn 
                         kept popping into my mind all night 
                         long at the most inopportune times. 
                         I couldn't get rid of him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How inconsiderate.

                                     KATE
                         Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, 
                         the more persistent he became. He's 
                         conceited and inflated and unseasoned 
                         and it doesn't seem to matter... 
                         He's 134 years old but I can't get 
                         him out of my head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is he there right now?

                                     KATE
                         Right here. Larger than life.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll protect you...

               They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, would you grant me license 
                         to dine with you tomorrow evening at 
                         eight o'clock?

                                     KATE
                         Permission granted.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Until tomorrow, then.

               They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. 
               They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the 
               kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He 
               carries a casserole dish.

               A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing 
               an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little startled)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     KATE
                         YOU do. What have you got there?

               Leopold opens the casserole dish.

                                     KATE
                         Hamburger Helper!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I know you like it.

               Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL 
               MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. 
               This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.

               INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT

               The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow 
               throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful 
               World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me more.

                                     KATE
                         Um, where was I? So after my father 
                         died I had to go to work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you had many jobs?

                                     KATE
                         Many. I got fired from all of them. 
                         I'm the most unskilled person I know. 
                         But they were just survival jobs 
                         while I was still in school. I always 
                         knew I wanted to go into science 
                         like my father. And I did.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I think about him every day. He was 
                         courtly, just like you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I think you are a remarkable woman 
                         Katherine Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You just don't get out much. You'd 
                         be surprised how remarkable I'm not.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No, it is you who would be surprised.

               They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They 
               kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They 
               look at each other, deciding.

               Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

               Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads 
               him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two 
               figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the 
               figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good morning.

                                     PATRICE
                         Morning.

               They kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is 
               set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from 
               the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see 
               each other for the first time.

                                     KATE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

               They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.

                                     KATE
                         Look what you've done!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's nothing.

                                     KATE
                         Nothing? My own mother never made me 
                         a breakfast like this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will have to have a talk with her.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         About last night...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please sit down.

               He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, I had never before been a 
                         considerate man. I had, with 
                         astonishing complacency, squandered 
                         my life, waiting for some incentive 
                         to force me into action. You have 
                         made me see how rare our time here 
                         really is. I am most beholden to you 
                         Kate. And always will be.

                                     KATE
                         I sense the word "BUT" entering into 
                         this any minute now.

               Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, 
               bracing for worst.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming 
                         my wife.

               Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shall I take that as a "yes"?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         That's entirely beside the point... 
                         You're moving way too fast here. 
                         Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's 
                         obvious the first one went well...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where I come from that's pretty much 
                         the way it works.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, even though last night we... 
                         loved each other, that doesn't mean 
                         this morning we're engaged. It just 
                         doesn't work that way now.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking a ring off 
                              his fingers and 
                              placing it on hers)
                         I have loved you since I first set 
                         eyes on you. I cannot imagine my 
                         life without you beside me. I want 
                         to marry you, Kate and make an honest 
                         woman of you.

                                     KATE
                         Oh Leopold, sit down.

               They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.

                                     KATE
                         Relationships these days are much 
                         more complicated than that. Women 
                         today have certain freedoms that men 
                         have been taking advantage of for 
                         centuries. You must have been aware 
                         of that. If you think about it 
                         clearly, it should be obvious to you 
                         that marriage between us is out of 
                         the question.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you not love me Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (almost inaudible)
                         Don't ever think that...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Then consider my proposal.

                                     KATE
                         I'll think it over but I can tell 
                         you now the answer is...

               He kisses her. It's impressive.

                                     KATE
                              (out of breath)
                         Possibly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a knowing smile)
                         I need you beside me. I will not 
                         give up easily.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling)
                         Do what you have to do...

               Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely 
               selfconscious.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD AND KATE
                              (too casual and too 
                              chipper)
                         Morning!

               Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite 
               right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the 
               table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Coffee?

               Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a pause)
                         I would like some coffee.

                                     KATE
                         Of course. Say when.

               She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         When.

                                     KATE
                         Sorry.

               As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He 
               eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.

               Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, 
               looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a 
               beat:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Uh huh.

               All smile privately and sip their coffee without another 
               word.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors 
               in earnest.

               She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes 
               in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and 
               breaks.

                                     DR. KAY
                              (calling from her 
                              office)
                         Kate, are you all right?

                                     KATE
                         Fine! I'm fine.

               She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her 
               mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has 
               SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.

               She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window 
               around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she 
               stares back at the paper on her desk.

               She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of 
               Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her 
               mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.

               Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. 
               She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, 
               she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles 
               away.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. 
               Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at 
               Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles 
               sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She 
               snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock 
               Museum.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On 
               the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun 
               control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Public office is apparently still 
                         the last refuge for the incompetent. 
                         Show me a man who does not want his 
                         gun registered and I'll show you a 
                         man who should not own a gun. What 
                         is a pee-pee girl?

                                     KATE
                         What are you reading?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The Village Voice. After much 
                         consideration, I have decided it is 
                         time I join the work force.

                                     KATE
                         As a pee-pee girl?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps not that, but I am determined 
                         to acquire honest employment.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I don't know if that's such 
                         a good idea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, my life back home was beneficial 
                         to no one. I want my new life to 
                         have value. I won't make the same 
                         mistakes twice.

                                     KATE
                         You have to be patient.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I could conceivably wait my whole 
                         life away.

                                     KATE
                         You're awfully cute when you get 
                         causey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not waste any more time. I 
                         must make a difference.

               INT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY

               Customers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold 
               is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume.

                                     LEOPOLD

                         It is called, POISON.

               He squirts some at her.

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         Oh! I don't think so. Have you got

                         her some POISON.

               INT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING

               The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door.

                                     KATE
                         Hi.
                              (the doctors remain 
                              silent)
                         What's the matter?

               There is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are 
               on to her. She puts down her pen.

                                     KATE
                         So you know.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We had to go through your computer 
                         to access information. Your 
                         calculations have been verified and 
                         the final course has been set. Leopold 
                         goes back a week from Friday 1:17 
                         a.m.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         How long were you going to keep it a 
                         secret, Kate?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Were you even going to tell us at 
                         all?

                                     KATE
                         I'm not sure.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Not sure? What can you be thinking? 
                         You can't alter the course of history 
                         and assume everything will be okay. 
                         It won't be. He has his own destiny 
                         to fulfill in his own time.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         You don't understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (gently)
                         He's going back, Kate.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         It's over.

               Kate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the 
               door. Just the sound of the clock ticking.

               Kate sits at her desk very still.

                                     KATE
                         No... No, no, no.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Charlie knocks and enters.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There you are. I've only been 
                         hollering for the last...

               He sees her face. Kate's eyes are red and swollen. She lays 
               out Leopold's belongings.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate? What is it? What happened?

                                     KATE
                              (very detached)
                         It's time. Leopold's going back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         Yup. I'll get his things together. 
                         Tell him tonight.

               He goes to her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you all right?

                                     KATE
                              (pulling away)
                         I'm fine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't look so fine.

                                     KATE
                         Well I am. It was wonderful having 
                         him here, Charlie. He was of 
                         invaluable assistance to the project.
                              (she shrugs)
                         I'll miss him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'll miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!

               Kate remains silent.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, don't do this. Please. It's 
                         not right.

                                     KATE
                         What am I supposed to DO, Charlie?? 
                         I can't go back. He can't stay. I 
                         can't let him go. I'm not equipped 
                         to deal with this, Charlie. I don't 
                         know how.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be 
                         the ice princess.

                                     KATE
                              (beginning to tear up)
                         I'm not!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You are. You can't live your whole 
                         life under a microscope. You've got 
                         to tell him how you feel.

                                     KATE
                              (breaking down in his 
                              arms)
                         It's too much, Charlie. It's just 
                         too much.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe it to him.

                                     KATE
                         I didn't know I could feel like this. 
                         I really didn't know.

               INT. FANCY FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         So I looked him right in the eye and 
                         said, 'Ego is nature's compensation 
                         for mediocrity.' I turned and I 
                         walked. He never said a word... He 
                         probably didn't understand it... 
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (cold)
                         What?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you all right? You're awfully 
                         quiet.

                                     KATE
                         I'm fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How was your day?

                                     KATE
                              (taking a long pause)
                         It's time.

               Leopold looks at her.

                                     KATE
                         We're sending you back.

                              (slowly pushing his 
                              plate away)
                         When?

                                     KATE
                         A week from Friday, early morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No!

                                     KATE
                         It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out 
                         of our hands. We can't POCKET people 
                         from history like stolen jewels. We 
                         haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll 
                         miss you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that all?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to do, fall apart? 
                         You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't 
                         solve anything.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is this woman sitting across 
                         from me?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to say, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me that you love me as I love 
                         you. Let me hear you say it.

               Kate remains silent. Leopold abruptly throws money on the 
               table.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not do this. I'm sorry.

               We starts out.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold!

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm. 
               His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he 
               winds up walking along Central Park South.

               Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. 
               He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's 
               head.

               He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the 
               skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays 
               his face against the horse's head, torn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee 
               boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her 
               way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the 
               front door, DISHEVELED.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God. Look at you. You look awful.

                                     KATE
                         You should see what I'm looking at.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I went back to the restaurant. They 
                         told me you went out looking for me 
                         right after I left.

                                     KATE
                         That was pound cakes ago. Where were 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I had a lot to think over.

                                     KATE
                         Such as?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just where I stand around here.

               There is a long pause.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         We should have come up with something 
                         together. I might have been spared 
                         ten or seventy pounds.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that an apology?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry for what I said.

               Leopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her 
               hands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     KATE
                         Yes you are...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going. I'm staying here with 
                         you.

                                     KATE
                         But? You can't! We have no right 
                         to...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is my destiny. It is my decision.

                                     KATE
                         Have you thought about what you'd be 
                         sacrificing? Your influence? Your 
                         authority?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Your family, your whole way of life, 
                         everything?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         You're not just feeling sorry for me 
                         because I ate the contents of the 
                         refrigerator, are you?

               They kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate. The single most 
                         miraculous event in my life was not 
                         how I arrived here, but that when I 
                         did, I found you.

                                     KATE
                              (overwhelmed)
                         Here comes the mushy part!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         After much consideration I've come 
                         to the conclusion I no longer desire 
                         a large estate with a full staff and 
                         ornate grounds.

                                     KATE
                         That's good, because if you're staying 
                         I'll probably get fired again. What 
                         do you desire?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A beautiful wife, a small home in 
                         the middle of nowhere, lots of 
                         children, and fine schools with PMS 
                         meetings every other Sunday.

                                     KATE
                         ...PTA?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         PTA.

                                     KATE
                         I love you too. I do, Leopold. I 
                         love you, too.

               They kiss.

               INT. LABORATORY - DAY

               Leopold and Kate sit calm and resolute. The doctors are in 
               an uproar.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         This is outrageous! I won't allow 
                         it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The decision is not yours to make.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Do you realize what you're saying? 
                         You're tampering with fate, 
                         preordinance, and God himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We do that every day, doctor. It is 
                         called CHOICE.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Dr. Carlson is still over there. You 
                         can't simply abandon her. We have to 
                         get her back.

                                     KATE
                         Do you think I'm not aware of that? 
                         Do you think a minute goes by that I 
                         don't feel responsible for her? But 
                         SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Only one person can return. The 
                         capsule accommodates only one person. 
                         Leopold has to find her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she does not wish to return. 
                         Perhaps she's found greater happiness 
                         in her new life. It happened to me.

                                     KATE
                         Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe 
                         she's of more important use back 
                         there.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Julia Carlson died in the Center 
                         Factory fire of 1897, two years after 
                         she arrived. She was 37 years old.

               There is a stunned silence.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Dear lord.

                                     DR. KAU
                         She was a friend, Kate. She was never 
                         expected to sacrifice her life for 
                         this experiment. I won't be a party 
                         to it. I know what I'm asking... 
                         There's no way we can force you to 
                         go. Just think it over.

               INT. BEDROOM - 2:30 A.M.

               A clock is ticking loudly. Kate and Leopold lie back to back.

                                     KATE
                         You're going back aren't you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I keep seeing that poor woman's face. 
                         She was terrified.

                                     KATE
                         You said you wouldn't leave me... 
                         I've never been lucky. Not one time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Six months ago I wouldn't have given 
                         it another thought. I wouldn't have 
                         lost a moment's sleep. You've changed 
                         me, Kate. There is no turning back.

                                     KATE
                         I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's 
                         what's tearing me up inside. Either 
                         way I lose... You've changed me too. 
                         I can't go back to my old life 
                         anymore. I can't live like that again. 
                         God my heart is pounding like a drum. 
                         I've never been so scared in my life. 
                         Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take 
                         me with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You don't realize what you're saying! 
                         You don't understand the kind of 
                         life you'd lead. What you'd be giving 
                         up.

                                     KATE
                         I'd be with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't ask that of you.

                                     KATE
                         Just ask me... Just ask.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Come back with me.

               She slowly turns. She embraces him.

                                     KATE
                         Yes!

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - NIGHT

               Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through 
               the street. She is clumsier than usual.

                                     KATE
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is something I've wanted to do 
                         for a long time.

               She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign: 
               ROSELAND.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This will be very therapeutic.

               He takes her arm and escorts her in.

               INT. ROSELAND - NIGHT

               Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and 
               Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls 
               her close.

               This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they 
               shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more 
               than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold 
               holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest 
               time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING

               Large screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold, 
               and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly 
               time.

                         The time tables have been set. Just 
                         strap yourself in and you'll be fine.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You have only a twenty four hour 
                         leeway before the machine is set to 
                         return to us. You must find Carlson 
                         within that time frame and get her 
                         on board or there will be little 
                         chance of her finding a way back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's been a real pleasure. You have 
                         a much nicer smile than Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The privilege was mine.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.
                              (she gives him a kiss)

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, my.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you... 
                         as soon as possible. I'll see to it 
                         myself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         See that you do.

                                     DR. KAU
                         You have my word on it.

               The doctors leave.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Four minutes and counting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.

               He sticks out his hand.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodbye.
                              (impulsively Leopold 
                              embraces Charlie)
                         I shall miss you Charles, more than 
                         you know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're 
                         the only one who knows how to program 
                         the VCR... Take care of my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will.

                                     CARLSON
                         You better. Take care of yourself 
                         too while you're at it... So long.

                                     KATE
                         I don't have any words for this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will see you soon.

                                     KATE
                         I know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You'll be with me all the time.

                                     KATE
                         I know. I brought you something.

               She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger.

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't forget me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't think this was all a 
                         dream.

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Don't forget about me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Wait for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         For as long as it takes.

                                     KATE
                         I will come back to you! I will!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll be waiting.

               They kiss again for the last time.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's time Leopold.

               Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they 
               part.

               Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself 
               in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against 
               the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her 
               hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.

               After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder 
               silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         9 8 7 6 5 4...

               Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's, 
               his hand still against the glass.

               Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         3 2 1!

               Dr. Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold. Leopold pulls 
               the lever, still gazing at Kate. There is a blinding FLASH 
               of light, then darkness.

               INT. LAB - MONTHS LATER

               Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the 
               doctors.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         I cannot in good conscience let you 
                         go. It's out of the question.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         I can't be a part of it either Kate. 
                         I'm sorry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It's too big a risk.

               Kate rises and moves to the window. She is a full NINE MONTHS 
               PREGNANT.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         We cannot guarantee your child's 
                         safety. It's that simple.

                                     KATE
                         He's waiting for me. I can feel it. 
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She gazes out the window, searching the horizon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SMALL FARM HOUSE - EVENING

               Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old, 
               rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as 
               puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up 
               in her car.

                                     CARLSON
                         Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.
                              (yelling inside)
                         MOM??

                                     CARLSON
                         You're Leo aren't you? You don't 
                         remember me but I knew you when you 
                         were yea big.
                              (she holds her hands 
                              an inch apart)

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your 
                         mothers.

                                     LEO
                              (proudly)
                         We had spaghetti at our house 4 times 
                         this week.

               Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.

                                     KATE
                         Leo you don't have to holler like 
                         that. I'm not deaf...

                                     CARLSON
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                         ...Carlson?!

               The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.

                                     KATE
                         Carlson, I don't believe it. It's 
                         been... I don't know how many years. 
                         What are you doing here.

                                     CARLSON
                         I came to see you, sweetie.

                                     KATE
                         You remember my son, Leo?

                                     CARLSON
                         We've just been getting acquainted.

                                     KATE
                         Well, come inside. Come inside.

               INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living 
               room before joining her.

               Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is 
               furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.

                                     KATE
                              (covering her agitation)
                         Would you like some tea? I wish you 
                         had called before you come over. It 
                         would have given me a chance to 
                         straighten up the house... myself... 
                         my life. Tell me what you've been up 
                         to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard 
                         you received some big endowment or 
                         something. I was going to write, 
                         then call, but...

               She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently 
               she has to put it down.

                                     CARLSON
                         It's all right, Kate. I understand.

               There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                         You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a 
                         lot of time to get your affairs in 
                         order... And I warn you, it's nearly 
                         impossible for an intelligent woman 
                         back there.

               Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would 
                         be proud. We're aware of your 
                         situation but we felt when the time 
                         came, you deserved the option.

               Kate nods, trembling slightly.

               INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off.

                                     LEO
                         Who was that lady?

                                     KATE
                         Just an old friend.

                                     LEO
                         What she want?

                                     KATE
                              (she looks at Leo)
                         Nothing important. You brush your 
                         teeth?

               Leo shows off his teeth.

                                     KATE
                         Then give your old mom a hug and go 
                         to bed.
                              (Leo gives her a hug 
                              and a kiss)
                         Good night, cookie.

                                     LEO
                         Good night.

               Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the 
               house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear 
               are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.

               She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits 
               down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in 
               thought.

               She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls 
               out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHOTO ALBUM

               Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, 
               magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.

               A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he 
               departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for 
               a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It 
               is the same ring Kate gave him.

               A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to 
               establish a scientific center researching studies in time 
               and space.

               A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, 
               marching to give women the vote.

               A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, 
               stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing 
               to his ring.

               A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing 
               a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded 
               by academia and subtly points to his ring.

               A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with 
               Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.

               A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting 
               regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one 
               hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against 
               his chest, showing off the ring.

               An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in 
               bombings.

               A tear falls on the page.

               Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera 
               follows her gaze past her property...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER

               LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time 
               as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, 
               older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.

               Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, 
               approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.

                                     KATE
                         He's so YOUNG, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's old enough.

                                     KATE
                         Look at that idiotic expression on 
                         his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's happy.

                                     KATE
                         Of course he's happy. All weddings 
                         are happy. It's the living together 
                         afterwards that causes all the 
                         trouble.

               Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet 
               hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.

               Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, 
               over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the 
               guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, 
               Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.

               Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. 
               Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not 
               wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you're so young... I love you, 
                         Leo. Always remember that...

               From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries.

                                     LEO
                         Mom, we're only moving to Denver.

                                     KATE
                         I know, cookie. I know.

               INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

               From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console. 
               A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the 
               darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps 
               herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the 
               lab.

                                     KATE
                         Well...

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. Me too.

               They embrace each other for the last time.

                                     KATE
                         What will I do without you, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (softly)
                         Live happily ever after.

                                     CARLSON
                              (pushing the intercom 
                              button)
                         Kate, it's time.

                                     LEO
                              (emotionally)
                         Here. It's a letter for my father. 
                         Tell him about me and... um, tell 
                         him I love him. I want him to know 
                         me.

                                     KATE
                         Leo...

                                     LEO
                         Mom, I want you to go.

                                     KATE
                         But...

               He puts his finger to her lips. He looks to his wife then 
               back at Kate. He nods his head.

                                     LEO
                         Go.

               They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the 
               moment.

                                     CARLSON
                         Ready!

               Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, 
               the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson 
               raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:

                                     CARLSON
                         9, 8, 7...

               Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. 
               She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, 
               staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         3, 2, 1!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand 
               there motionless, stunned.

               The screen is BLACK.

               EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT

               A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. 
               A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, 
               stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The 
               creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, 
               rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses 
               a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance 
               floor.

               In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very 
               distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young 
               woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.

                                     FLIRT
                              (brushing his shirt 
                              front)
                         I just love a starched white shirt. 
                         It's so elegant.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                         Skeeky.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. You dance like an angel Miss 
                         Beall. You light up the room around 
                         you. I thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                              (with a big smile)
                         Thank YOU.

               The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a 
               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the 
               staircase.

               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every 
               turn as Kate searches each male face.

               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up 
               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up 
               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, 
               flouncing down the stairs.

               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks 
               for Leopold.

               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. 
               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns 
               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.

               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then 
               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold 
               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at 
               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her 
               his hand.

               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their 
               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT 
               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her 
               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. 
               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment 
               of youth, when they fell in love.

               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He 
               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands 
               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he 
               wraps his arms tightly around her.

               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes 
               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count 
               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.

               THEY DANCE...

               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.

                                     LORD WHITEHEAD
                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?

                                     LADY WHITEHEAD
                         I've never seen her before.

               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze 
               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.

               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The 
               rest of the world dances around them.

               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO 
               SCREEN.

               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate 
               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly 
               point to their rings.

               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for 
               studies in physics.

               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to 
               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.

               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It 
               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching 
               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly 
               into the camera, they show off their rings.

               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...

               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost 
               in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

FADE IN ON:

1	EXT: SKY - DAY

A WHITE BIRD soaring. The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and
mauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate
pink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with
him. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears.

2	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY

It is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like
intricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO
MAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there
by lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle
at the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at
the same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a
better look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on

3	EXT: GLADE - DAY

It is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sun
washes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line of
lush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from the
trees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a
flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pink
light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her
head to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace.
She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has
heard something.

GIRL: Is it you?

She takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly

GIRL: Your Highness!

The GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes,
the shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TO
REVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly
at the PRINCE.

GIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.
For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot
consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest
hill to deepest dale is ...

Suddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her
face.

GIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows in
concentration and then) Damn!

She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a
rolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.

The PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil
crown. He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lunges
happily towards the GIRL who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but
15-year-old SARAH.

SARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WE
CAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeans
and running shoes.

SARAH: Get off me, you monster!!

The DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping
to be chased. SARAH doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls the
grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG
comes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.

SARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over.

The DOG obediently drops the book.

THE BOOK

On the cover it says, _MEANDER'S QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin
Zakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.

SARAH leaps to her feet.

SARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We're really late! Why does everything have to
happen to me!!!?

MERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH
pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He
rushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.

SARAH: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt!!

She hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and
tags along behind her.

4	EXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAY

SARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward
the street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on the
other side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isn't pink
any more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a
suburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary
place.

5	EXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSK

SARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes through
the front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees
the beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.

6	INT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENING

SARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the
stairs. She almost makes it. SARAH'S MOTHER appears in the hallway.

MOTHER: _Sarah_, where have you been?!!!

SARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension
of the stairs.

SARAH (in an affected voice): I can't talk to you now. I'm in
rehearsal.

She continues grandly on and heads for her room.

MOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for
Freddie! Don't we at least deserve an explanation?

SARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with a
melodramatic solemnity.

SARAH: As Meander's Queen, I've been ... meandering. Dither me not
about explanations.

With that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a sign
that says: "Admittance by Invitation Only." SARAH'S FATHER comes into
the hall.

FATHER: What's that all about?

MOTHER: It's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's no
reason to...

SARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.

SARAH: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_!

She dramatically sweeps into her room.

7	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene.

FATHER (VO): _Sarah_, that's no way to talk to your mother!

SARAH (mumbles to herself): She's not my mother.

SARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footsteps
and SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.

SARAH ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes.

With a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving her
gown in place.

STEPMOTHER (VO): _Sarah_, when I tell you to be home at five, I
expect you to be home at five.

SARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHER's attitude -- hands on hips,
and silently mimes her words.

SARAH: Yes, Madame!

7A	INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

STEPMOTHER: And don't "Yes Madame" me!

FATHER: Is she all right?

STEPMOTHER (frustrated): Of course she's all right! I left the
Bernsteins' number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be coming
down with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit
uncomfortable ...

SARAH (VO) (sighs): Yes, Mother.

STEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!

She hurries down the stairs.

FATHER: We'll see you later, baby. And remember ...

7B	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH speaks along with him, mimicking.

SARAH & FATHER (VO): Don't open the door to strangers.

We hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her
bedroom door.

SARAH: And don't call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimicking
her parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold
...

She sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,
and she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled
with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are
lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we
would see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and
according to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her
dresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of
drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew
by her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs
on the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE
GIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped
to the mirror. The headline says, "Linda Williams a Smash in New
Play." A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says
_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently
opens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to
the strains of an unbearably tinny version of "Greensleeves" she
begins to rehearse.

SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord
...

Suddenly, something stops her cold.

SARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room!

Through the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the
shelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.

8	INT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT

SARAH bursts out of her room.

SARAH: Where's Lancelot?

She stomps down the hallway.

SARAH: Where's my bear?!!

9	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH enters FREDDIE's room. She searches the nursery.

SARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.

She opens a toy box and rifles through it.

SARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...

She gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling
at Lancelot, SARAH's tattered old teddy bear.

SARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!

She yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his
face starts to cloud up.

10	INT: SARAH 'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside
her. She looks at the DOG.

SARAH: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin.

He licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.

SARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord
...

She is interrupted by FREDDIE's cries.

SARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!

The cries get louder. SARAH sighs and repeats her favorite litany.

SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?

11	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH enters and approaches the howling INFANT.

SARAH: I don't need this.

She pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in.

SARAH: There, isn't that nice ...

But FREDDIE doesn't think so. He pushes the blanket off and howls
even louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up
and gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.

SARAH: Want your nice toy?

But FREDDIE doesn't. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bends
over the crib and speaks softly.

SARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with a
baby who won't stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and
teach him a lesson ...

FREDDIE lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper.

SARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...

FREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Then
he really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to pace
back and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a mere
whimper.

SARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?

She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the
BABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabre
lullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,
how "the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you're small" and
how "a baby doesn't stand a chance when the Goblins start their
dance." She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild
dance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,
making strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when too
many crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIE's
dresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of
thunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Little FREDDIE is wailing. He hasn't understood a thing that SARAH
has sung but he can sense that something is wrong.

SARAH: Ah, c'mon, Freddie. It was just a song.

They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts with
a gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, is
suddenly quiet.

12	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

SARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts to
open it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain and
only then opens the door.

13	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHT
SARAH'S POV

Through the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,
quite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,
or is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightning
illuminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH can't help
but gawk.

MAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... Sarah
Williams, the actress?

SARAH's jaw drops.

SARAH: That's me.

MAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) I'm
Robin Zaker.

SARAH squeals with delight.

SARAH: You wrote the play!

He smiles.

SARAH: Just a second.

14	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

SARAH's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she
unfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.

ZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a
delightful Queen Meander.

SARAH: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know?

ZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that
it was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of
the play, which of course is delightful for me.

SARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.
The firemen had to use the hall.

ZAKAR: Yes, I know, that's why I wanted to stop by to see you.

They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And
then FREDDIE begins to howl.

SARAH: That's my brother ...

There is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs.

SARAH: I'll be right back!

ZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks
right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.

15	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

FREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in
and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is
crashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE's screams
are piteous.

SARAH: Oh, Freddie ...

There is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened
room.

ZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ...

SARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has
a drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.

SARAH: You shouldn't be up here!

ZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ...

SARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.

16	INT: HALLWAY - NIGHT

SARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR
follows. FREDDIE is still crying.

SARAH: Maybe you'd better leave ...

She gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is
making her very nervous.

SARAH: ... I, uh, don't think I care to talk to you about the play.

He is right behind her, almost too close.

ZAKAR: Neither do I.

SARAH is shocked and disturbed by this.

SARAH: What!

ZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE's hair.

ZAKAR: I'm more concerned about the baby, of course.

SARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach.

SARAH: Freddie's just fine.

But he isn't. He's still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of
FREDDIE's face. The BABY stops crying.

ZAKAR: There, isn't that better?

SARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...

ZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room.

ZAKAR: I'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in
here and I'll do some other tricks for him ...

SARAH: No! You've got to ...

But he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the
BABY.

17	INT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands
in the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits
down across from him.

ZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...

He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.
It comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH
rolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn't
impressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.

ZAKAR: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you
know what that means?

He leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer.

ZAKAR: It's time to call the goblins!

SARAH: What?!!

SARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her
silly threat to FREDDIE earlier.

ZAKAR: Yes. That's what we do with bad babies ... we send for the
goblins!!

And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a
poorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs
with relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,
unconvincing goblin voice.

ZAKAR: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I bet
your sister doesn't ...

SARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very
strange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR's hands
are visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,
and disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out
of her chair.

SARAH: Where is it?!!!

ZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall.

ZAKAR: It's in there.

SARAH: Impossible!

ZAKAR: See for yourself.

SARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on
the rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the
door.

ANOTHER ANGLE

the puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to
face ZAKAR.

SARAH: How did you do that?!!

ZAKAR leans back into the sofa.

ZAKAR: Magic.

SARAH: Oh sure ...

She nods, skeptically. She can't see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --
the cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,
fierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature
that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is
busy with another problem. She doesn't see FREDDIE!

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!

ZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She
calls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room
doorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops
and listens.

SARAH: Freddie?

But it wasn't a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as
CREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear
faint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.

SARAH: Where is he?!!

ZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the
chair and can't see anything. But when she comes around in front of
it she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he's
playing with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the
puppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up
the BABY.

SARAH: Who are you?!!!

ZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the
sofa and lands very close to her.

ZAKAR: I've been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is
_Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!!

SARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away.

SARAH: I don't believe this!

Amidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,
and he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak
swirling around him. And what's worse, much, much worse, is that
suddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under
chairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the
room.

18	INT: FOYER - NIGHT

It's worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME
slide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but
is soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the
front door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The
GOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into
JARETH's arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH
tries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.

SARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back!

JARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs
with delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman
effort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto
JARETH's fluttering cloak. It's like being caught up in a whirlwind
of incredible force.

SARAH (screaming): I ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him!

But it's too late. SARAH's feet leave the ground and she is pulled
with them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up
through where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.
There's a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH's laughing face; SARAH,
desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who's having
a great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH's garment pulls
out of SARAH's grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her
face.

19	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY
A WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT

The sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO
SEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall
that extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various
ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to
us, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of
those ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn't. This is HOGGLE. In
a CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and
goes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like
creatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.

HOGGLE: An' how's me pride an' joy!

He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing
with pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by
the whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and
lands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.

HOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!

SARAH struggles out of the broken shrub.

SARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!

HOGGLE: I ain't horrible, I'm _Hoggle_. And just look! You've
destroyed me prize blossoms!

He realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen.

HOGGLE: I'll get ya for it, you big oaf!

And he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she's had
enough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from
the deepest space, this guy is child's play. She reaches out and
pulls the can from HOGGLE's hands. She then grabs him by the
shirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.

SARAH: Oh no you don't! If anyone's getting anything around here,
it's me ... now where' my brother?!!

HOGGLE: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go!

SARAH sighs and lets go.

SARAH: I'm sorry. But this just hasn't been my day.

HOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.

HOGGLE: Ye ain't the only one.

SARAH ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them.

SARAH: And I don't understand any of this!

HOGGLE shakes his head and sighs.

HOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.

SARAH: What do you mean?

HOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin' they can make it
through the labyrinth says sumthin' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,
high pitch) ... I don't understand this, whatever am I doing here,
how will I ever get home ...

SARAH: What makes you think I'm here to get through a labyrinth?

HOGGLE shakes his head again.

HOGGLE: Can't think of any reason why you'd be standin' here in front
o' this gate if you weren't.

SARAH doesn't understand what he is talking about but when she looks
up she can't believe her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless
wall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly open
and a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for his
life. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strange
BEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch up
with the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the
gate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seems
like hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. And
beyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then the
wooden doors slam shut.

SARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!

HOGGLE: That's Jareth's goblin army, and that other poor fool musta
been caught meanderin' where he had no business.

SARAH: What will they do to him?

HOGGLE: I don't like to think about things like that.

SARAH shudders.

SARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?

HOGGLE sighs knowingly.

HOGGLE: He's taken sumthin' o' yours, ain't he?

SARAH is clearly surprised.

HOGGLE: Jareth, our high an' mighty king ...

SARAH nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation.

HOGGLE: Bet he's gone and taken sumthin' you love.

SARAH (shrugging): Close. He's got my baby brother.

HOGGLE laughs derisively.

HOGGLE: Baby snatchin'! That's low.

SARAH: So I've just got to do something!

HOGGLE: Like what?

SARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!

HOGGLE: Then ya'd have ta make it through the labyrinth, 'cause
Jareth's castle is at its very center.

SARAH looks at the gates and gulps.

SARAH: Is it difficult?

HOGGLE snorts with derision.

HOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?

SARAH is reaching the breaking point.

SARAH: Look, I'm sorry about your bush! But it's not like I asked to
have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out
of the sky!

HOGGLE: Well, I didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on
me prized possession, neither!

SARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!

And she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way.

SARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to some
weird guy who should be living under a bridge ...

She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the
gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might
be the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There's no way she wants to
risk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as
she backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and
whirls around.

HOGGLE: That ain't the only way in, ya know!

SARAH is very relieved to hear this.

SARAH: It's not?!

HOGGLE: Course it ain't. There's many a route in ... just only one
way out.

SARAH: Well show me one! I've got to find my brother!

HOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling
it in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and
bracelet and ring you can imagine.

HOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...

SARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired.

SARAH: I could give you this ...

She takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn't interested.

HOGGLE: I had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind ...

He takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby
ring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.

SARAH: No. My mother gave me that.

HOGGLE eyes it greedily.

HOGGLE: She could give ya another ...

SARAH: No, she couldn't. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) She
lives real far away ...

The sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet.

SARAH: This is all you get.

He grabs the circlet and bites it.

HOGGLE: Bah! It's paste!

Something catches SARAH's eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.
She leans over for a better look.

SARAH: No it's not, it's plastic.

HOGGLE's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he
strings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the
FAIRY.

SARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...

HOGGLE reaches for the spray can.

HOGGLE: Let me at it!

SARAH is enraged.

SARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!

Just then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her
hand and cries out in pain.

SARAH: It bit me!

HOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,
screaming all the way.

HOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There's nuthin' more vicious than a
flower fairy. Any fool knows that!

SARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry.

HOGGLE (sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya?

A tear trickles down SARAH's cheek. HOGGLE sighs.

HOGGLE: I got a feelin' I'm gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Come
with me an' I'll show ya a way in.

SARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE
looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.

HOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic!

20	EXT: LABYRINTH - DAY

Another part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH
a tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.

HOGGLE: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the
labyrinth ...

SARAH: The first part! What comes after that?

HOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.

HOGGLE: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...

SARAH: That sounds inviting ...

He is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can't hear him.
She quickly tries to follow.

SARAH: Wait! Wait! I can't hear you ...

21	INT: LABYRINTH - DAY

HOGGLE is through the door.

HOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...

SARAH's head appears.

HOGGLE: ... that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe ...

He looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and
straining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs
her hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the
doorway. She lands flat on her face.

HOGGLE: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya?

He chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up
and dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems
rather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a
flower peeks through a crack.

SARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn't seem
so bad at all.

And with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.

22	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

SARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge
and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.

FACE: Go back! Go back before it's too late!

SARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the
corridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER
FACE.

FACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!

SARAH turns and runs back the way she came.

SARAH: Hoggle!

23	INT: LABYRINTH - DAY

HOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.
SARAH comes rushing toward him.

SARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ...

HOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya?

He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came
from.

HOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya
haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle.

SARAH quickly follows.

SARAH: False Alarms?

24	INT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

The corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their
routine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.

FACE 1: This is the path of no return!

FACE 2: Beware! Beware!

HOGGLE: Just ignore 'em.

SARAH: Are you sure?

HOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE.

FACE 3: Abandon all hope ...

HOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?

SARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance.

FACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!

HOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention.

FACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon all
hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!

HOGGLE (bored): Very nice ...

SARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along.

FACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed!

25	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

HOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor.

HOGGLE: Ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be around
here, Missy ...

SARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I'm interested in is getting my
brother back from that creep.

She starts to look around for something.

HOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat
Jareth.

SARAH picks up a rock.

SARAH: Well, maybe I'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth
business.

She takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor.

SARAH: See, now I'll know which way we came in case I get lost.

HOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the
course around here, what ya want to do is go forward.

SARAH: Look, Hoggle! I've got to find Freddie and I don't need you to
discourage me!

HOGGLE: And I don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in
circles with you!

SARAH: That's fine with me! (she starts off) I know you're only after
my ring, anyway!

She turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing
his face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious
little creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the
floor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it
with the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.

BRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!

HOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back
into its hole.

26	EXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY

The WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.
She thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for HOGGLE.

27	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

SARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE.

SARAH: But ...

She whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again.

SARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I'm sure of it!

HOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor.

SARAH: My mark! It was right here!

HOGGLE comes up beside her.

HOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren't what they appear to be around
here ...

JARETH (VO): Except when they are.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp
with surprise and fear.

JARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?

She starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back.

JARETH: Nothing ... yet.

He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks
down at HOGGLE.

JARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn't it?

HOGGLE is humiliated.

HOGGLE: Me name's Hoggle.

JARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You're
the greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn't you be
back there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?

He chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE
fumes silently. SARAH doesn't like this.

SARAH: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size?

He looks her up and down.

JARETH: Whom did you have in mind?

SARAH tries to brazen it out.

SARAH: I don't have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want
him now!

JARETH throws back his head and laughs.

JARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I'm really growing
rather fond of him.

SARAH: Where is he?!!

JARETH: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.

He ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they BOTH step
backwards.

JARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I'm considering
turning him into one.

SARAH thinks this is crazy.

SARAH: You can't do that!

JARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can.

SARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath.

SARAH: Can he?

HOGGLE nods glumly.

JARETH: But let's make it interesting. I won't do it for ... thirteen
hours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to
save him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable
goblin prince, don't you?

He laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He
then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch
in one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes
it greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at
it and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up
again, JARETH is gone.

WORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!

SARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming
from. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the
brickwork.

WORM: That's what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time
she found that one around here she sent him packing.

SARAH: Jareth?!

WORM: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure. Now,
how about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.

SARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM
and gives him a beaming smile.

28	INT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor.

SARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on
time?

HOGGLE: It's hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, I'd worry 'bout
first things first.

SARAH: What do you mean?

HOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin' the
babe and I mean ta see that ya do!

SARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.

SARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!

HOGGLE gets all flustered and tries to act gruff.

HOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin' that ring from ya after all if
I plays me cards right.

SARAH regards him affectionately.

SARAH: I know you don't mean that. You're helping me because you're
really nice.

HOGGLE: I ain't nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.
(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more've us
haven't had the guts to do the same.

The WORM reappears.

WORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out of
the oven.

SARAH: Thanks, but we really don't have any time. We've got to get to
the castle.

HOGGLE: Ya wouldn't happen to know a shortcut, would ya?

WORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.

SARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.

SARAH: But there isn't any left turn.

Just then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and
walks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a
hat shaped like a bird.

WORM: See, there's a left turn right there, where that Wise One just
came in.

SARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!

HOGGLE: I wouldn't bet on it.

But SARAH is excited about the possibility of getting more help.

SARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to the
castle?

WISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I'm glad you asked that
question.

To SARAH's and HOGGLE's surprise, the HAT joins into the conversation.

HAT: Now you've done it, gone and asked him a question. We'll be here
all day!

WISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a
stronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,
but usually not a portcullis ...

HAT: What did I tell you? There's no stopping him now.

WISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet
-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...

HAT: Shut up down there!

WISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port
...

SARAH looks at HOGGLE.

SARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.

HAT: Well, I told you that, didn't I? But nobody ever listens to me!

He looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE.

HAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!

The WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE.

WISE ONE: Did one of you say something?

SARAH thinks quickly.

SARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.

WISE ONE: That's very wise. An idea worth savoring.

HOGGLE nudges him.

HOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!

HOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn't.

HAT: Ve-ry funny!

The WISE ONE continues on his way.

WISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I'm glad you brought that up. The
stranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from
beyond the sea ...

HAT (hysterical): I quit! I can't take it anymore!

And then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it
wasn't there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.

SARAH: How did he do that?!!

HOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back?

SARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM.

WORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through
it. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It
doesn't apply around here.

SARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE
entered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is
actually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells
back to the WORM.

SARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we're sorry we missed her
biscuits!

And then they walk through the wall and are gone.

29	INT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with
delight. HOGGLE wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the
wall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they
are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to
the top of one and looks over.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE

SARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn't look far at all!

HOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how
they got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.

SARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let's go!

HOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.

30	INT: CASTLE - DAY

JARETH's great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the
labyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the
hovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to
the dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in
thought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.
Behind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too
much for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.
Meanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach
JARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE
GOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.

FEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It's bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...

The STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues his
approach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and then
scrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.

STUPID GOBLIN (to himself): Bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...

JARETH turns and sees the GOBLIN.

JARETH: Well, what is it?

The GOBLIN can't answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so
continues his painfully slow approach.

STUPID GOBLIN: ... bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...

Annoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by his
shirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.

JARETH: I said, what is it?!!!

STUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... they're
halfway th .... through th ... the maze.

JARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this and
laughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in his
arms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to an
ARMED GOBLIN by the door.

JARETH: I think it's time they had some company.

ARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!

Be then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then
stumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.

JARETH: You'll make a much better goblin than that, won't you,
Freddie!

FREDDIE's response is to clap his sticky baby's hand on to JARETH's
face. JARETH, pretending he doesn't mind, carefully removes it. He
then looks down to the courtyard below.

31	EXT: CASTLE - DAY
JARETH'S POV

ARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.

32	EXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to come
to a corner.

SARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,
that's really weird ...

They turn the corner and HOGGLE stops short. SARAH becomes alarmed.

SARAH: What is it?

HOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he
hears -- marching. They look back the way they came.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S AND HOGGLE'S POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marching
right towards them!

ANOTHER ANGLE

They look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to get
through the wall the way the WORM showed them.

HOGGLE (quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and ...

He smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAH
flies by him.

SARAH: Come on!

33	INT: CASTLE - DAY

FREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it on
the nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS in
the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. They
begin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. He
sings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is
to OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.

34	INT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAY

While JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.
They get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with
crumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position and
see dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS are
everywhere.

In another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF
LITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the
oncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as
they do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the
cracks between the bricks.

In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of
spears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.

They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming
small, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a
breath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They
scurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie
across an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.

35	INT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO
GOBLINS bring up the rear.

GOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.

GOBLIN 2: But I'm better at maiming. Everybody says so.

And they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their
hiding places.

SARAH: Do you think they're gone?

HOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya
know. They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as
you do.

He folds his arms and leans against the wall.

SARAH: I'm not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...

Suddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on
another secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.

36	INT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY

HOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides
the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --
the Garden Maze.

HOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are!

SARAH: That'll be a nice change.

He ignores her and looks around excitedly.

HOGGLE: This place is the end o' the maze! That means we're near the
entrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth.

SARAH: The second ring? What's that?

HOGGLE starts down the corridor.

HOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze!

SARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what's it like?

HOGGLE: Don't know, I ain't never made it this far before.

He is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.
It is a strange clanking sound.

SARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What's that sound?!!

HOGGLE stops skipping and sighs.

HOGGLE: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we's
finally safe ...

SARAH: So you think we're safe, do you?

HOGGLE (annoyed): Didn't I just say so?!!

SARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.

SARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It
is now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.
He screams.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (A
slashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and
chopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up
whatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around it
because it completely fills the corridor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came
in, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAH
starts to run for it.

SARAH: Come on!

HOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through
the wall.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on a
hook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.

SARAH: Hoggle, hurry!

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steady
progress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the
door but to no avail. She is terrified.

SARAH: None of the keys work!

Desperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yards
away from her.

HOGGLE: Why don't you just try it?

He then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries the
knob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesn't
see is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.

SARAH: It's open! Hog ...

She turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just a
few yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards
through the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches
it WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers' uniforms have
been pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, cranking
the wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.

37	INT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAY

SARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with large
paintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clone
call with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.

SARAH (to herself): What in the world ...

She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her
eyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hour
hand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch
that Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.

SARAH: Only 9 hours left!

The next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. On
closer inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back a
sob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with
staircases going off in all different directions on different planes
of gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLIN
happily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by the
next painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait of
JARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THE PORTRAIT'S POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and we
hear the sound of JARETH's breathing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes by
another painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes her
go back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.
In the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETH's castle. And in the
sky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed by
what she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITE
BIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.

SARAH: Hoggle!

SARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because it
really is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look
and over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tiny
voice.

HOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!

And SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching
her hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a
shimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then she
disappears right through the painting.

ANOTHER ANGLE

THE GALLERY. And JARETH's portrait is now blank.

38	EXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY

SARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him.

SARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again!

HOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work with
the floor, as well!

SARAH laughs and hugs him again.

39	INT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY

SARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They
are tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and
sighs.

SARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feet
from where we started.

HOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as day
we should be goin' this way ...

He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in
pain and SARAH sighs and follows him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge.

SARAH: Got any more suggestions?

Before HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible
gut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.

SARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!

HOGGLE points in the opposite direction.

HOGGLE: Then let's go this way.

SARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again.

SARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt!

HOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction!

SARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become
more unbearable.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the
screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.
HOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what
she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from
screaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he
heads right back into the maze.

40	EXT: CLEARING - DAY

SARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that
they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken
pains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of
them and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,
powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly
unbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing
him. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting
CREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,
who bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are
free to bite him whenever they get near.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge.

SARAH: The poor thing!

HOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH
looks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and
carefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks
his helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,
swinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.

BLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?

The OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks
towards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The
OTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE
CAN SEE their progress in the BG.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO
suspended upside down. She can't undo it and yells for HOGGLE

SARAH: Get out here, you coward!

HOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a
dagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one
hack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE
freeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and
they head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a
determined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he
picks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the
clearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge
immediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping
in fear.

ANOTHER ANGLE

LUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He
taken one hand and wipes away a tear.

LUDO: Ludo ... hurt.

SARAH's heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal.

SARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?

He nods and wipes away another tear.

LUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.

SARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer
and pats his arm) But it's all right now.

LUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile
you have ever seen.

LUDO: Friend!

SARAH: That's right, Ludo! I'm your friend. I'm Sarah.

LUDO: Sarah ... friend!

HOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the
whole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there's
one thing he doesn't want, it's competition for SARAH.

HOGGLE: I think I'm about ta be sick.

They ignore him and LUDO grins for all he's worth as SARAH beams up
at him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.

HOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along,
Missy. He'll just slow us up.

SARAH: Are you kidding?! He'll be a great help! The goblins are
scared of him because he's so fierce ...

Just then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked
for her. She takes it and smiles at him.

HOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean.

SARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.

HOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin' fine on our own.

SARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You want
to help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo?

LUDO: Save ... baby. Good!

SARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO
right behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.

41	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAY

SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with
two SARAH-sized doors in it.

HOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we
gotta do is pick a door ...

SARAH: What difference does it make? Let's just go!

LUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors.

LUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.

HOGGLE: Well, that's great news. (to Ludo) Don't suppose ya know
which is which?

SARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look
at them.

LUDO: One door ... good. One door ...

HOGGLE: All right, ya walkin' mountain! Ya made ya point.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each
one has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,
except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it
stuck in its mouth.

SARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you have
to do is knock.

The KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks.

KNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?

SARAH jumps back, stunned.

SARAH: You can talk!

KNOCKER 1: What? What? You'll have to speak up!!

KNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...

SARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER.

SARAH: You too!

KNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...

SARAH shakes her head in amazement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BOYS are still at it.

HOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?

LUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.

HOGGLE: That figures, don't it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming)
Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyond
me.

LUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.
HOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is excited.

SARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the right
door to the forest?

KNOCKER 1: It doesn't do to ask me. For some reason I can't hear a
thing.

SARAH turns to KNOCKER 1.

KNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.

KNOCKER 2 gets very excited.

KNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...

SARAH: I get it! You can't talk with that ring in your mouth!

She removes the ring and looks at the FACE triumphantly.

SARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.

KNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.

SARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?

KNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.

SARAH: Of course, why didn't I think of that.

She tries to get the ring back in its mouth.

KNOCKER 2: Oh no you don't, young lady! I've had just about enough of
that awful thing, thank you very much!

SARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won't
let me knock on it?

KNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldn't say now, could I?

SARAH throws up her hands in disgust.

KNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can't hear a thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE and LUDO are still at it.

HOGGLE (conspiratorially): Ya know ... even if she does get the door
open, ya won't be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us all
and take a hike?

LUDO: Ludo ... Stay!

HOGGLE is disgusted.

HOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, ain't ya?

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH suddenly gives KNOCKER 2 an evil grin.

SARAH: Are you sure there isn't anything I can do to change your mind?

KNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!

SARAH: That's what I thought!

The KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezes
its nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth
before it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of
triumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.

SARAH: Let's go!

She goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. They
BOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a
tangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.

HOGGLE: Now you've done it!

In a frenzy, HOGGLE starts banging on both doors.

HOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!

42	EXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY

SARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is no
door, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and as
its name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,
but it is very faint.

SARAH (scared): Hoggle?

43	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAY

HOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door
swings open.

HOGGLE: I'm coming ...

He rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice
that he is falling down a deep hole.

HOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy!

We hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone.

LUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.

He is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and
begins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.
LUDO brightens and chases after them.

LUDO: Wait!

The WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down.

HAT: This ought to be a good one!

LUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!

WISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful
thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that
which gives access, a gate or gangway ...

He continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently.

WISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a
propylaeum ...

HAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,
if I had ears ...

WISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...

44	EXT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH has waited long enough.

SARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?

She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is
on the 7.

SARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into her
pocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause I
can't wait.

Then determined, she strides off.

45.	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There
is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.

HOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can't swim!

46	EXT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly
lost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it
to get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits
down on the ground.

SARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?

But there's no time to think about that because she hears the sound
of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering
LITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the
clearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is
terrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the
CREATURES aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,
frenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can't help but be taken in by the
wild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to
the wild rhythm.

SARAH (laughing, moving): What are you?

WILD THING 1: We're Wild Things, baby! Wild!

WILD THING 2: Wild and free!

WILD THING 3: Get down!

And then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. As
and turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.

WILD THING 1: You call that wild! I'll show you wild!

And then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes his
head off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a
juggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his
shoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THING
pushes her back into the middle of the melee.

WILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!

And they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes
out of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on the
ground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAH's feet
looking straight up.

WILD THING 2: Snake eyes!

SARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and the
frenzy more frenzied and she can't help getting a little wild
herself. She begins to really dance.

WILD THING 3: That's it, baby, get wild and free! But you'll never be
as wild as me!

And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a
basketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispers
conspiratorily.

WILD THING 1: I wouldn't call that really _wild_, would you?

SARAH: Well, it's ... uh ... sort of ...

WILD THING 1: I'd call _this_ wild ...

And he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf
ball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The head
goes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries to
get it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all
the other WILD THINGS and she can't find it. So there's SARAH,
running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears
start to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabs
her hand and turns her around.

WILD THING 2: That was _wild_, baby. (he starts to dance) Now how
'bout gettin' wild with me?

But SARAH has had enough.

SARAH: I think I'll sit this one out ...

WILD THING 1: Not with us you don't ...

WILD THING 2: 'Cause we're _wild_!

And then they're all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and
it's really too much.

SARAH: Enough! I've got to find the castle!

WILD THING 2: Well, why didn't you say so, baby!

WILD THING 3: That's a _wild_ idea!

And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it
back and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH and
propel her into the woods.

WILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!

47	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesn't
have the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the
water in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in the
sheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.

JARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isn't little _Piggle_!

HOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back to
the ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.

JARETH: Did the girl decide she doesn't need you, now that she has
that beast?

HOGGLE (angry): She wouldn't do nuthin' like that!

JARETH leans over the water, laughing.

JARETH: Don't you know she could never care for a repulsive thing
like you!

HOGGLE splashes and tries to stay afloat.

HOGGLE: She does care! Me 'n Sarah is friends!

JARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I've
definitely got something better in mind!

HOGGLE: Don't you hurt her!

HOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back
down into the water.

JARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_.

He grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water.

JARETH: You can be with me or against me.

HOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do?

JARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...

He leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face.

JARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.

HOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die!

JARETH sneers scornfully.

JARETH: Then so you shall.

He drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.
HOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.

HOGGLE: Wait!

JARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of
amusement on his face.

HOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her!

He splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water.

JARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...

He reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach.

JARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this.

He tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the
water starts to recede.

JARETH: You've made a very wise decision.

He leaves, followed by the GOBLINS.

HOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'!

HOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and
he is sitting on cold, damp ground.

48	EXT: FOREST - DAY

The WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along
but they couldn't care less.

SARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?

WILD THING 1: Oh, did you say "the castle"?

WILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!

WILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!

WILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea!

He leaps on SARAH and she flings him off.

SARAH: OK, guys, fun's over.

She starts to leave and they pull her back.

WILD THING 2: Over! It's just begun!

And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than
ever. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren't
hurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is
start throwing their heads at each other and switching them.

WILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild!

ANOTHER ANGLE

A door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background
WE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.

WISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also
verandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an
antechamber or foyer ...

HAT: Why me?!!

The door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and
is just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and
cries out in relief.

SARAH: Ludo!

LUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?

SARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!

LUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches
its target and calmly tosses it into the trees.

WILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That's a little _too_ wild ...

But there's no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other
heads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their
heads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.

SARAH: Oh, Ludo! I'm so glad you're here!

She gives him a kiss and he beams.

SARAH: Where's Hoggle?

LUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.

SARAH: We've got to find him! Do you think we can?

LUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.

LUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...

He ambles off with SARAH following.

LUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...

49	INT: HOLE - DAY

HOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.
Suddenly LUDO's head appears above.

LUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.

HOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.

HOGGLE: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a
thinkin' creature!

SARAH appears from behind LUDO.

SARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won't get you out.

HOGGLE's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.

HOGGLE: Missy!

50	INT: FOREST - DAY

SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do
not know that they are being spied on by JARETH'S GOBLINS.

51	INT: CLEARING - DAY

The THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a
wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can
see. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts
on either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.

SARAH: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice ...

Suddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice.

VOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!

At first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of the
voice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent
in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the
posts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are
dumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.

HOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...

DIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.

DIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!

HOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach.

SARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It's a matter of
life and death!

DIDYMUS shrugs elegantly.

DIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,
fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.

SARAH: Oh, it is!

DIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.

SARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It
appears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up
into the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk
toward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.

DIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!

To his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking.

DIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_!

This gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.

HOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about?

It is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty
war cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,
administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.
HOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He
comes back and faces LUDO.

DIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the
gravest affront!

And with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,
begins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a
triumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is
nothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is
the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity
DIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of
LUDO's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.
And LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,
leaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts
him totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their
weapons. And, to everyone's surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.

DIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble
knight.

Then DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to
look LUDO in the eyes.

DIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.

LUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset
his gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.

DIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,
have fought me to a standstill.

LUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS' paw into his own huge hand.

DIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as
one!

SARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDO
smiles from ear to ear.

LUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!

Then he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in
their case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.

SARAH: Well, now that that's settled let's get going.

She heads for the bridge but DIDYMUS blocks her way.

DIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.

SARAH is incensed.

SARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!

DIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.

HOGGLE, enraged, turns on LUDO.

HOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!

LUDO: Brother ... good!

HOGGLE: Well, if he's so good, why won't he let us get on with our
business?

LUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside the
crestfallen DIDYMUS.

SARAH: OK, let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you
sworn?

DIDYMUS brandishes his sword.

DIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way
without my permission.

SARAH: Then may we ... _have your permission_?

DIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUS
looks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has
ever had to call on before, he says it.

DIDYMUS: Yes.

And the sky doesn't fall, and the earth doesn't heave, and everything
is exactly as it should be.

SARAH: Thank you.

DIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.
LUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because the
rickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump back
on the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over the
deep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.
With a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and
looks forlornly over at the others.

SARAH: Oh no!

SARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken
bridge.

HOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!

DIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my
brother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.

SARAH: I'm not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I'm just upset because time
is running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.

DIDYMUS is struck to the very roots of his chivalry.

DIDYMUS: You mean to rescue _a child_?!!

SARAH: The goblin king took him, and I've only got ...

She takes out the watch. The hour hand is on the 5.

SARAH: ... five hours to get him back.

DIDYMUS yells across to LUDO.

DIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?

LUDO: Save ... baby.

DIDYMUS is overwhelmed.

DIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my
sword.

He bows low before SARAH and she smiles.

SARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.

HOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development.

HOGGLE: This is all well an' good, Missy. But we still got one little
problem.

They all look across the fissure at LUDO.

LUDO: Ludo ... friends.

HOGGLE: Yes, yes. We're friends. Very nice. What's that got ta do
with us gettin' over there without a bridge?

LUDO: Rocks ... friends.

HOGGLE: We're wastin' our time, Missy. Let's you an' me go find
another ...

He is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a
sympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions
until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk
across.

LUDO: Rocks ... friends!

SARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo!

She skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS
whistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH
gasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.

SARAH: It's ...

DIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.

SARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth.

52	EXT: FOREST - NIGHT

The edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the
distance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of
stars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.

DIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?

SARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.

DIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to
defend your honor?

SARAH: Not even one.

DIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such
dishonor to my lady?

SARAH: It's a place where ... where nobody really sees me.

LUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!

SARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) And
thanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.

He bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels
rejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.
After a moment, SARAH follows him.

SARAH: Don't you feel like resting?

HOGGLE: I ain't tired.

SARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.

HOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn't notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and
DIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against
AMBROSIUS' side.

SARAH: They're both wonderful, aren't they?

HOGGLE: They're alright.

SARAH: They're more than that! They're loyal and strong ... and with
their help I'm going to beat Jareth!

HOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought.

SARAH: And yours, too, of course.

HOGGLE: I ain't no fighter ...

She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.
HOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.

HOGGLE: Missy ... if you're hungry ...

He holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world's most
delicious looking peach.

SARAH: Oh, great!

She happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has
to not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then
stumbles.

SARAH (laughing): Everything's dancing ...

She looks up at the sky, exhilarated.

SARAH: Even the stars are dancing!

HOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she
gazes happily at the sky.

53	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

FREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the
room, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees
in front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and
sends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he
pulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the
head. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits
down next to him.

JARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.

He waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful
crystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like
so many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up
his legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his
pajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the
balls into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing
bubbles.

JARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...

And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over
the labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.

54	EXT: FOREST - NIGHT

SARAH's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the
ground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are
approaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,
haunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE
that each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one
in SARAH's music box. She gets up and follows them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HOGGLE watching from the woods.

HOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damn
me too!

ANOTHER ANGLE

A bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears
enchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.

55	EXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT

A giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles
rush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.

56	INT: BALLROOM - NIGHT

The music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a
magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th
Century Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the
music in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you
sense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.
The GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,
giving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very
provocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and
daring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the
waist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is
the feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this
setting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering
behind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly
self-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into
one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her
image. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her
gasp.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing
with a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying
to get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see
him that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a
YOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers
something into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN
throws back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at
waist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH's
music box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the
cover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved
like a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs
away. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.
JARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,
watches SARAH.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper
something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask
and licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself
looking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn't with
a partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around
him, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to
face the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then
she realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves
through the CROWD to get a better look.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH's arms, and she is the most
beautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the
attraction between them is palpable.

JARETH: You look like a queen.

SARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words.

SARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don't know what I feel ...

JARETH (smiling): Don't you?

And he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in
his arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his
grip around her waist.

SARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?

JARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come
true.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost
falls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the
lap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs
away from them, frightened.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never
looked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if
he, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his
lips and whispers in her ear.

JARETH (whispering): My Queen!

Then he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her
everything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants. A song
that says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.
Forget and stay in the dream.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer
to JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed
out of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles
against a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying
and she can't make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN
comes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves
his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes
closer, and closer.

ANOTHER ANGLE

OUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,
pushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble
itself.

57	EXT: BALL - NIGHT

SARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom
crumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.

58	EXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There
are piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents
from which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach
SARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN
stooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons to
SARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.

JUNK WOMAN: 'Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fings
you need.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE SARAH's room!

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She trips
over the threshold and lands face down on her bed.

59	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes her
head and laughs.

SARAH: What a dream!

She gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smiles
at her reflection.

SARAH: Yep, you've got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great
actress needs.

She walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear.

SARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...

She goes over to the door and opens it.

60	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH'S POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.
The JUNK WOMAN peers in.

JUNK WOMAN: 'Aven't you got everythin' you need, Dearie?

61	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH screams and slams the door. She buries her face in the bear.

SARAH: It _is_ just a dream!

She takes a deep breath and goes to the door again. She opens it very
slowly.

62	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH'S POV - THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY. The JUNK WOMAN peers in
again.

JUNK WOMAN: Best to stay in there, where it's safe, Dearie. Don't
know what might 'appen to you out 'ere.

63	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OF
REVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtains
closed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutching
the bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy
bear.

OLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where it's safe. Don't know what
might happen to you out there.

SARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea
of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. As
she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her
and pull her down.

SARAH: Help! Somebody help me!

64	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

LUDO and DIDYMUS desperately searching for SARAH, DIDYMUS riding his
DOG.

65	INT: TAVERN TENT - NIGHT

HOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER
works behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down.

HOGGLE: Another!

The BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure
off his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours.

66	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

DIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN.

DIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way?

JUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin' in a place
like this?

DIDYMUS: She's on a rescue mission ...

The JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious.

JUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You're in the wrong place, for
sure! The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our
worldly goods!

She takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for
emphasis.

67	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out
hopefully.

SARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me!

The door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside.

JUNK WOMAN: Don't worry, Dearie. I sent 'im away!

SARAH groans.

JUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for
no rescue mission.

SARAH: Oh my god! Freddie!

JUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that
nice teddy?

SARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk.

SARAH: No! He's my brother! And I've got to save him!

She continues pushing through the junk.

JUNK WOMAN: No you don't, Dearie. You can stay right 'ere with all
your pretty fings ...

SARAH knows what her choice has to be.

SARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don't want to!

She lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in
the doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly.

SARAH: Now get out of my way!

68	EXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT

SARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face.

The JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to
SARAH.

JUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!

She holds out SARAH's music box, opens it, and the little DANCER
twirls inside.

SARAH (grinning): Keep it!

And she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN.
And we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had
just seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very
different. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a
cross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the
pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is
the puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been
operated. JARETH is mad.

JARETH: Damn.

69	EXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

LUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the
night.

DIDYMUS: My lady!

LUDO leaps to his feet.

LUDO: Sarah ... safe!

SARAH rushes into his arms.

DIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you?

SARAH pulls away from LUDO.

SARAH: Hoggle made his choice, he's ... not part of the mission
anymore.

DIDYMUS (angry): The coward!

LUDO: Hoggle ... good!

SARAH shrugs, and smiles at him.

SARAH: Maybe. But there's no time to discuss it. We've got a baby to
rescue, remember!

She leads them through the gates.

70	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

Streets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS
live. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets
they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of
lights.

DIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady.

A CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN
sees him and drags him inside and slams the door.

SARAH (grimly): Methinks you're right!

71	INT: TAVERN - NIGHT

HOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that
the only treasure left is SARAH's plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it
off and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up
at the eight of this treasure.

BARTENDER: Another?

HOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it
and his face lights up with glee.

BARTENDER: Plastic!

He goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and
sobs.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at
HOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly.

HAT: Drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy?

HOGGLE looks up.

WISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate
from one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to
drink the waters of Lethe ...

HOGGLE (drunkenly): What's Lethe ...

WISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds
what is too painful to remember ...

HOGGLE looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand.

WISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that
which brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...

But there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONE's
pearls. HOGGLE is gone.

HAT: You can cool it down there ... he's gone ...

WISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...

The HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring
his plastic treasure.

HAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ...

72	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the
castle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet.

SARAH: We're going to make it!

DIDYMUS sniffs the air.

DIDYMUS: I am less than sure ...

They are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on
LUDO's back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems
like the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the
VANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get
by him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH
picks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many
of them. The threesome turn and run.

73	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

JARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits
on his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on
to the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee
below. The BIRD flies out the window.

74	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot
pursuit.

75	EXT: STREET - NIGHT

They come careening around a corner and it seems that they have
escaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting
farther away.

SARAH: I think we lost them.

They turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and
are right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and
looks over the streets.

DIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother?

LUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street
right towards them.

LUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble!

And then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into
swordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by
GOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees
his predicament. She gets an idea.

SARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!

LUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.

He then throws his head back and bellows.

76	EXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT

An enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with
boulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their
path like so many bowling pins.

77	EXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT

SARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing
off the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon
the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the
THREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and
DIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle
enclave.

78	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

A door opens in a dark part of the castle. LUDO, SARAH and DIDYMUS
enter. They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor.
They turn a corner and see some GOBLINS marching their way. They duck
out of sight.

79	EXT: CASTLE - NIGHT

The main entrance to the castle. TWO-GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the
large wooden doors. The results of the THREESOME's escape can be
heard in the distance. A FIGURE staggers out of the dark, singing
drunkenly. It is HOGGLE.

HOGGLE: " ... it's so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm
... "

He trips over his feet as he approaches the GUARD.

GUARD: Who goes there?

HOGGLE " ... so cold, oh so cold ... "

GUARD 2: Don't worry about him. He's on Jareth's payroll now.

HOGGLE falls to the ground, then picks himself up.

HOGGLE: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin' ... an' I'm here ta
collect ...

They laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter.

80	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

A GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor. They torment a
tiny, fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks. The CREATURE
gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. The GOBLINS
laugh. It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not be
noticed. Unfortunately the little CREATURE has no sympathy for their
plight. It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.

SARAH (whispering): Shut up, you little monster!

LUDO bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.

LUDO: Nice ... thing ...

But the CREATURE doesn't want a pet. It sinks its teeth into LUDO's
hand. LUDO howls.

DIDYMUS: I fear that this means trouble.

The GOBLINS yell and start running down the corridor.

SARAH: Run for it!

They are off, the CREATURE and the GOBLINS at their heels.

81	INT: CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The THREE are running for all they're worth. SARAH pulls the watch
out of her pocket. It is on the 12:30.

SARAH: Only a half hour left! We've got to find Freddie!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Yet another GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them. They stop in
their tracks and start running in the opposite direction.

82	INT: INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT

The THREE come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard.
Balconies look down on it from the floor above. Opposite them is a
large ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, but
not for long.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughs
sadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands on
a huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in
front of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide
to leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINS
gaining on them. And they're throwing spears! Suddenly there is a
triumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, and
then a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.

SARAH: Hoggle!

It certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the
struggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever
and it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering
the courtyard.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER
aims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles
with the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against
it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body
on the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of
his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.
They hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes
down the door and they run in.

83	INT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

SARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have
seen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is
there and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him
only moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks
feverishly around the room. She spots a door.

SARAH: That's the only way he could have gone!

She runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow.

SARAH: No. I have to face him alone!

DIDYMUS: But, my lady ...

He is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start
trying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body
against it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.

HOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...

She puts her finger to his lips.

SARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?

HOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...

SARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ...

She looks down at his empty belt.

SARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process.

HOGGLE: I don't care if I never sees another treasure again!

SARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind.

She slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand. He
is overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure.

HOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me.

SARAH: Jareth doesn't know everything.

She leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans.

SARAH: Take care of him, Didymus.

DIDYMUS: I'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life!

The GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses
against the door even harder.

LUDO: Ludo ... too!

She runs to the other door and stops to look back at them.

SARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.

And she is gone.

84	ESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT

SARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and
doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that
obviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees
buckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly.

JARETH: I've been expecting you.

SARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She
tries to adjust to being upside down.

SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!!

She has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly
grueling.

JARETH: He's right there.

And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle
from the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from
SARAH's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the
top.

SARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!!

FREDDIE gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawling
up the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends
her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to
orient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY
is about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He
begins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was
gain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like "up"
and "down."

ANOTHER ANGLE

FREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a
staircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH
creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,
it bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She
turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the
archway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she's looking, the first
reflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,
and so on all the way down the line. And SARAH's still standing
there! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,
watching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on
the wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE
on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off
that, he'll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds
that there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to
reach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at
FREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of
the song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and
can't repress a grin of her own.

SARAH: Like the man said, "nothing is what it appears to be!"

She jumps.

85	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

SARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH
sits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his
lap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a
few minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.

JARETH: There's still time.

He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her
watch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He
looks down at her.

JARETH: Besides, I'm no longer interested in having a little goblin
prince. I've decided I'd much rather have a queen.

He looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn't look away.
Instead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.

SARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.

She glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles
appreciatively.

JARETH: You've come a long way, little girl.

SARAH looks out at the labyrinth.

SARAH: I certainly have.

She turns to face him.

JARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) No
one else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has
ever been worthy ...

He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles
down at him.

SARAH: What's your offer.

JARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long
way!

JARETH: Why, everything ... you'll rule by my side.

SARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by
repulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...

JARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the
world, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do.

SARAH looks at him.

SARAH: Anything else?

JARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course.

SARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.
She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer
to FREDDIE.

SARAH: And what if I'm not interested?

JARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head.

JARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...

SARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth.

She makes a beeline for the cradle.

SARAH: I don't want _you_!

She's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her.

SARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep!

JARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and
punches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up
the screaming FREDDIE.

SARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!

JARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned.

JARETH: You hit me!

SARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him.

SARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... !

She is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the
BABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.
JARETH howls and grabs his leg.

SARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth!

The WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH's
shoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.

JARETH: Don't say that!

But it is too late, he starts shrinking.

JARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me!

Before SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,
snivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but
still recognizably JARETH.

86	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT

JARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks
the door.

JARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me!

They look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS
are no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh.

HOGGLE (proudly): She did it!

They cheer.

87	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

JARETH, the bratty little GOBLIN, is throwing a tantrum.

JARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want!

The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a
crack opens up right in front of SARAH's feet. She looks at the clock
and the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There's
nothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.

SARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!

She jumps.

88	EXT: SKY - NIGHT

SARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking
of the clock continues.

ANOTHER ANGLE

CLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And
they go on spinning.

89	INT: NURSERY - NIGHT

SARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries
to sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner
of the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIE's crib. When she can
see, she gasps. FREDDIE's not there! The side of the crib is down and
the BABY is nowhere to be seen.

SARAH: Freddie!

She leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers
out into the hallway.

90	INT: RAILWAY - NIGHT

SARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a
delighted grin.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,
into SARAH's room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength
to pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be
then holds his hand out, trying to reach something.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face.

91	INT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT

SARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE.

SARAH (softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie.

FREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,
and WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH's bear.
SARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on
her lap, and hands him the bear.

SARAH: Here. It's yours.

FREDDIE takes it happily.

SARAH (smiling): You earned it.

She kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the
window at the stars.

92	EXT: HOUSE - NIGHT

The light shines from SARAH's window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down
from the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.

THE END

LEGEND
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY by WILLIAM HJORTSBERG

2nd Draft Revised 10 March 1984


1EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven. 
Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb. The setting is 
tranquil and utterly majestic.

Over the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams 
scintillate in an etheral ballet.

Numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on 
the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity.

Squirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural 
enemies untied by the radiant LIGHT. 

A magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his 
branching antlers.

1A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

PULL BACK: from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep 
embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster. 

A snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand 
goblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, 
he is a terrifying figure. 

Blix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's 
call. 

Further back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle 
with weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and 
flithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque 
helmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep 
forward to join Blix. 

1B GOBLIN'S POV : HILLTOP 

The distant animals silhouetted by dazzling LIGHT. 

1C EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest 
towards the hilltop.

A moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His 
incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the 
moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash.

As the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually 
illuminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the 
eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in 
on the other side. 

Blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out.

The goblins crawl separately through the underbrush.

Pox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet. Terrified, the little 
shoat SQUEALS and scampers off. 

2 DELETED

2A CLOSE : ANIMALS 

Alerted by the NOISE, they face the impending threat. The startled 
animals run for cover down the hillside. 

3 DELETED 

3A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

Blix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow. 

BLIX: Kill. . . . ! 

Blix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, 
closely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder. Brilliant clumps of 
forget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels. 

3B GOBLIN'S POV : DISTANT FOREST 

The pair of shining LIGHT BEAMS race away between the trees. 

4 DELETED 

5 DELETED

5A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

The goblins watch the LIGHT BEAMS disappear. Blix GROWLS in 
frustration. 

BLUNDER(musing): . . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . 
. . 

Blunder spots a SHINING silver hair caught on the bark. He reaches 
up and plucks it free. 

POX: What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap. 

BLUNDER: No! It's mine! 

Blunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the 
other end. 

POX: Give it to m-m-m-me! 

Both goblins pull on the hair. Miraculously, it does not break, but 
stretches between them like spun steel. 

BLUNDER: Turn loose, anus features! 

POX: Hard cheese! 

A furious tug of war. Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully 
to cut the hair. 

BLUNDER: It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine! 

Blix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together. Pox and 
Blunder fall dazed to the ground. 

Blix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it. 

BLIX: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. 
There be magic in this hair.
The beast ran off, faster and faster. 
We must take this to our Master. 

6 EXTERIOR VAST LANDSCAPE NIGHT 

An incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above 
the monnbright mist. The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil 
steeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill. 

6A EXTERIOR HILLSIDE NIGHT 

The goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate 
wasteland below. A mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far 
horizon. 

7 EXTERIOR SINISTER EVERGLADE NIGHT

A miasmic Jurassic swamp. Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs 
from the fetid water. 

The goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island, 
stepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to 
floating lily pads.
A cracked marble plinth juts out of the water. The goblins creep by 
a towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin. 

7A EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

A v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged 
crocodile. 

Blix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his 
game belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface. There is an angry 
swirl and it is gone. 

Blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting 
out of the water like a petrified serpant. 

The ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark. Blunder 
follows its progress with fear-widened eyes. 

BLUNDER:Wish i was still a leprecaun. . . .
Stay clear of nasty places
like this and do nothing all day but 
sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine. . . .

Furious, Blix turns on him, his finger to his lips. 

BLIX: Shhhh! 

Unchastened, Blunder whirls on Pox and repeats the gesture: 

BLUNDER: Shhhh! 

Pox follows suit with Tic: 

POX: Shhhh! 

Not to be outdone, Tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him. 

TIC: SHHHHH! 

7B EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

HAIRY MEG MUCKLEBONES rises out of the bog, huge and hideous. The 
water hag is half corpse, half serpant. She seizes Tic and 
disappears beneath the foul surface. The goblin's final CRY trembles 
in the chill night air. 

7C EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT
Blix, Pox, and Blunder are terrified. They scramble over the twisted 
root in a wild panic, leaping onto a floating log. 

BLUNDER: Run. . . . ! Panic. . . . ! Emergency. . . . ?

The log rolls beneath their frantic feet. They barely keep their 
balance. 

POX: Frog spit!

BLUNDER: Snail Sperm!

BLIX: All together. . . .now or never!

The goblin co-ordinate like tiny lumberjacks, running in unison. The 
rolling log drifts forward.

POX: J-j-jolly good! Team spirit and all that!

The log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore.

8 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

An enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle. 
Tangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a 
malformed sea monster. An atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the 
site. 

The goblins stare back across the bog. 

BLUNDER: Poor Tic. . . .

BLIX(growling with anger): Forget Tic! Less is always more.

POX: Better we spilt three ways than four! 

Blix hurries up the crumbling steps. Pox and Blunder follow. 

The steps lead under gigantic twisting roots. Blix finds a small 
opening and slips inside. 

Pox and Blunder like this less and less but follow their leader 
without complaint.

9 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

The three goblins tumble down a steep slope. The giant tree is a 
vast hollow stump, open to a moonlit sky, surrounding a smaller tree 
transfixed by a curved bronze horn, an instrument of unspeakable 
evil. 

Pox and Blunder stare up like open-mouthed tourists. Blix is 
impatient. 

BLIX: Boost me. . . . ! Hurry. . . . ! We must sound the summons 
before the dawn. . . . 

The three goblins form a teetering ladder with Blix wobbling at the 
top and Blunder crushed at the bottom. 

Blix blows into the horn with all his might. Nothing happens. 
Suddenly, he breaks wind! 

Pox and Blunder grimace. 

Blix blows again into the horn.

There is no sound. Dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell, 
followed by three SQUEALING bats. 

The supporting goblins wobble. Pox steps on Blunder's head. 

Blix blows a third time into the great horn. 

The unholy SOUND reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed 
souls in Purgatiory. 

10 EXTERIOR FOREST(VARIOUS ANGLES) NIGHT

As the evil SOUND moans, the forest creatures react with terror. 

Squirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover. Birds flock 
to their nests. Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and 
owls perk up thier ears to listen.

11 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots.

BLUNDER: Now what. . . . ?

BLIX: We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate! 

11A EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle. Blix 
sits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog. The light 
of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of 
the hollow tree.

Blix plays with the silver hair.

BLIX(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze.
Soft as shadows, still as trees,
Darkness be in all we sees. 
He lives in silence, he lives in fire, 
He lives in all that's dark and dire. 

A mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance. It is a 
black cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray. 

12 EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

The flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler. The 
wind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth. 

Suddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree. 

13 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

Blix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night. 

BLIX: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. 
That be where you find our sire.

The pedestal is empty. The statue of the fidder has vanished! 

Blix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog. 

The black shadow of the LORD OF DARKNESS falls across him. 

Darkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned 
figure drpaed in bacl cloth. An awesome silence ensues. 

Blunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads. 

BLIX: Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! 
Strong like a lion, swift like a shark. 

Blix offers the silver hair up to Darkness. 

BLIX: Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for 
your amusment. 

Blunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix. 

BLUNDER: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the 
one who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold! 

There is a bight FLASH OF LIGHT. Blunder HOWLS with pain. 

Blunder stares at his arm in dismay. His hand is gone, magically 
replaced by a grotesque birdclaw. 

BLUNDER(stunned): Thank you, Lordship . . . . 

Blunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw. 

POX: Quite stylish, actually. . . . 

Darkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him. 

DARKNESS: Where. . . . ? 

BLIX: In the woods, six leagues back, 
'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track. 

DARKNESS: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which
cast this spoor? 

BLIX: I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, 
What beast it be I do not know. 

DARKNESS: This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes 
this way rarely. . . I must have this creature!

BLIX: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this 
creature. 

POX: Your instruction would be m-m-most 
ap-p-preciated. 

BLUNDER: Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge! 

DARKNESS: No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only 
lure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never 
fails. . . . 

BLIX: Name the bait, Lord. . . . 

DARKNESS: Innoncence! 

14 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

A beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds.

Baby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels 
forage for acorns and nuts. 

A delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe. Clouds of 
multi-hued butterflies swirl overhead. 

Waist-deep in flower, a young princess skips SINGING across the 
meadow. Her name is LILI. She wears splendid brocades and carries a 
bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin. Like these blossoms, she is 
beautiful and fresh and innocent. 

Tiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders. She laughs 
as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips. 

LILI(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. 
Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky. 
Living river, turn light to diamonds,
When I look in my true love's eyes. 

Lili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage. 

15 EXTERIOR BOULDER AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

Blix, Pox, and Blunder hide behind a boulder, watching the girl. 

BLIX(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin 
pure. . . . 

15A EXTERIOR COTTAGE AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

The WOODCARVER'S WIFE is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from 
behind the cottage. 

Grinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line 
and lets it drop. 

The laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass, A sheet drpaes around 
the outraged wife. 

WIFE: Dad-blamed faeries! 

16 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY 

The cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand-
pegged furniture. A WOODCARVER sleeps by his bench surrounded by 
wood-shavings and roughed-out toys. 

Lili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Her 
beauty is etheral, an angel descending. 

Finches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool. 
They rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach. 

The Princess peeks around the room. She tiptoes to the hearth and 
lifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste. 

Spying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a 
telltale crumb on her upper lip. 

The clock tolls the hour. A carved wooden maiden piroettes from the 
interior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle. Lili 
is fancinated. 

The Woodcarver's Wife enters. She curtsies to the Princess. 

WIFE: God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy. 

LILI: I've not come to visit, Nell 

WIFE: Won't you stay for a tart? 

Nell pulls a tray from the oven. 

WIFE(cont): They're fresh-baked. 

LILI: I've no time today. 

WIFE(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting. 

LILI: Nonsense! 

WIFE: Surely the king forbids such folly 

LILI: What my father doesn't know won't hurt him. 

WIFE: The wilful heart invites despair, 
Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair. 

With Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among 
the flowers in her bouquet. 

LILI: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me
out of the woods today.

WIFE: Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick
with spriggen and banshee!

LILI: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door? 

WIFE: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe 
won't be stole by faeries. 

The Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway. 

LILI(laughing): More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry 
yourself to death if you're not careful. 

Lili runs out like a naughty child. The Woodcarver's Wife 
leans against the door jamb and calls after her:

WIFE: Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! 
Stay away from old oaks! 

17 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH TO GLADE DAY 

Hiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch 
Princess Lili run SINGING through the woods, oblivous to any sign of 
danger. 

BLIX(scowling): May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . 
Ain't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . ! 

18 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

A lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in 
from the woods. She is familair with this spot. It is her trysting 
place 

LILI(calling): Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack! 

Lili looks around in exasperation. Behind her, something wild and 
mysterious swings through the trees like an animal. 

LILI(cont): Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me! 

Lili is apprehensive at getting no reply. She hears the RUSTLE of 
the leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb 
to limb overhead. 

LILI(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if 
you're here. . . . 

JACK O' THE GREEN, a legendry "Green Man" who lives the free life of 
a hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, 
landing without a sound. He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears 
woven ivy leaves and skins. 

Startled, Lili SCREAMS. 

LILI(cont): Jack! You scared the life out of me. 

Jack says nothing, staring at her shyly. Lili hands him the flowers. 

A JAY flies down out of the greenery and lands RASPING on Jack's 
shoulder. He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in 
English: 

JAY: She brings a gift as fair as herself. 

Lili LAUGHS, It all seems magic to her. 

LILI: You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in 
the flowers. 

Jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart. He stuffs 
it immediately into his mouth. 

JACK: Mmmmmmm. . . . 

LILI: Sweet? 

JAY: Sweets from the sweet. 

JACK: I know someone sweeter.

Lili blushes. 

19 EXTERIOR ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST DAY

Concealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green 
Man and the Princess wander down a meandering path.

Pox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches 
it down with a happy smile.

19A EXTERIOR MEANDERING PATH DAY 

Several birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders. Squirrels, rabbits 
and hedgehogs play about his feet. Jack feeds them nuts and berries 
from his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly. Jack understands 
the language of all wild creatures. 

When a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns 
its call. 

JACK: That was very good. . . .just right. 

LILI: Teach me rabbit like you promised.

JACK: Rabbit is much harder than wren. 

LILI: Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father 
thinks I'm brilliant. . . 

Lili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing 
reflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes. 

LILI(cont): See how brilliant I am! 

JACK(laughing): Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! 

LILI: Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom? 

Lili seems to glow with sunlight. Jack stares at her, rapt with 
love. 

JACK: Much more than wisdom dazzles me. 

Lili LAUGHS and hangs her madallion around his neck. 

LILI: Then teach me rabbit. 

JACK: Not today. . . . There's something really special I 
promised to show you. 

LILI(delighted): Oh, Jack. Do you mean it? 

JACK: If it pleases you. 

LILI: More than anything! 

JACK: This is their season. They won't pass here again 
for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you 
must do everything I tell you. 

LILI: I swear. . . on my honour! 

JACK: I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's 
sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, 
well. . . . 

LILI(impatient): What? Tell me! 

Jack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet. 

JACK: You'll have to wear a blindfold. 

LILI(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack? 

JACK: I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . 

20 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH, GLADE TO STREAM DAY 

Jack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through 
the woods. Distant thunder RUMBLES. 

JACK: Storm's coming. . . .

LILI: Who cares? Haven't you a cosy place to hide? 

JACK: Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . 

LILI: In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . 
I am only a pauper here. . . .

Jack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili. He bends towards her, 
closer and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss. 
She waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen. In the end, 
Jack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns 
away. Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and 
mischievously peeks. 

20A EXTERIOR BEHIND A TREE NEAR THE PATH DAY

The three goblin peer around a mossy trunk. 

BLUNDER: Yuck! Did you see what he was gonna do? 
Makes me want to puke!

BLIX: I swear by all the bats above, 
Nothing's quite so foul as love!

21 EXTERIOR UNICORN STREAM AND GLADE DAY 

A sun-glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest. 
Sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds, a stream flows down the middle. 

Jack leads Lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around 
her eyes. 

LILI(aewstruck): Oh, Jack. . . .! It's magic! 

21A EXTERIOR STREAMSIDE SHUBBERY DAY 

Some time has passed. Lili is uncomfortable and restless.

LILI: How much longer? 

JACK: Be patient! 

Lili kneels by the bank of the streem, cupping water into her hands. 
Jack stops her from drinking. 

LILI: I'm thristy! 

Jack points at a huge viper moving sinously along the bank. 

JACK: It's poisened the brook. 
No animal will drink here now. 

LILI(indignant): I want some water. 

JACK: Shhh! 

LILI: Don't tell me to be quiet. . . .! 
I'm a princess!

Jack pulls Lili back into hiding. 

JACK(very softly): Just watch! True royalty
approaches. . . .

22 EXTERIOR THE STREAM (JACK & LILI'S POV) DAY 

The radiant LIGHT BEAMS GLEAM through the trees. A moment later, a 
splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the 
stream. This is a stallion. He holds his head proudly. His mate 
stands at the edge of the woods. 

LILI(OS): Ohh....They're so beautiful.... 

The unicorn dips his horns into the stream. 

JACK(OS): The alicorn purifies the water. . . . 

The stallion watches his mare approach to drink. She is slighter and 
more delicate, but every inch as mignificent. 

JACK(cont)(OS): There's no creature with more 
power or magic. . . . As long as they roam the earth, 
evil cannot harm the pure of heart. . . .

23 EXTERIOR LARGE BOULDER OPPOSITE CLEARING DAY

The three goblins crouch hiding.

BLUNDER(disgusted): Ugly one-horned mules!

BLIX: Shhh! 

24 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The Princess is entranced.

LILI: Such grace. . . . Can you speak
their language?

JACK: A little. . . .it's very hard.
Unicorns talk only of love and laughter. 
Dark thoughts are almost impossible for 
them to express.

LILI: Oh Jack. . . I must touch one.

JACK(alarmed): No!

LILI: I want to!

Jack restrains the Princess when she attempts to get up from hiding.

JACK: It is forbidden. These are sacred 
animals.

LILI: Nothing is forbidden me!

JACK: Don't ever say that! You risk
your immortal soul. 

Lili pulls free and steps into the clearing.

LILI: You sound like my confessor. . . . 
I only want to touch one.

The Princess strides defiantly into the open meadow.

The unicorns watch the girl from across the stream. They snort and 
paw the ground.

Lili stands alone, holding her arms to the unicorns.

LILI(singing): Like a child feels watching a rainbow.
Like a brid feels the first time it flies
I feel magic stirring within me,
When I look in my true love's eyes.

The Stallion's nostrils flare. His strong neck arches. Sunlight 
gleams on his horn as he charges.

From Lili's POV the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards 
her acroos the stream.

The stallion rears and prances, racing around the Princess as if 
drawn foward on an invisable lead.

Jack watches from the underbrush, his outrage tinged with more than 
a touch of jealously.

25 EXTERIOR BOULDER DAY

Blix, Pox and Blunder peer from their hiding-place. Evil leers 
brighten their impish features.

POX(whipering): M-m-might as well be fish
in a barrel. . . One would hope for a 
t-t-touch more sp-p-port. . . .

Blix clamps his hand over Pox's mouth.

BLIX: Pox! Shut your yap!

26 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist. Lili 
makes no move as the trembling stallion stands before her, the 
rapier tip of his horn pressed against her breast. It is obvious he 
could kill her is an instant.

The Princess calmly reaches out and caresses his muzzle. 

LILI(singing): When the darkness falls like a curtain
And the rivers and streams turn to ice,
I have summer and daylight forever
When I look in my true love's eyes.

Across the stream, the mare paces back and forth, obviously 
agitated.

27 EXTERIOR BEHIND THE BOULDER DAY

Blix pulls a long black flute from his quiver. He takes a dried 
hornet from a black snail-shell with a hinged lid and slips it into 
his flute, aiming the instrument like a blowgun.

BLUNDER: Steady....take your time....
Don't miss...

Blix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl. His cheeks 
puff. There is a soft PHUT of expelled breath.


28 EXTERIOR CENTRE OF CLEARING DAY

The poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the 
haunch.

Stung, the unicorn bolts through the clearing, disappearing into the 
undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels.

The Princess stands be confused and bewildered.

Distant THUNDER disturbs the tranquility.

Jack rushes to Lili's side.

LILI: Oh, Jack, it was so lovely...
like a dream.

JACK(angry): You're lucky it wasn't a 
nightmare!

LILI: Don't be such a scold.... Come,
I'll chase your fears away.

The Princess takes Jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing.

29 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps. Leaping a 
deadfall log, the stallion stumbles. He struggles to his feet and 
continues running.

The three goblins gallop pell-mell on their devilish steeds. There 
is nothing comical about them now.

30 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack and Lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline 
pond.

LILI: Sweet William did a-hunting go,
In the wood where faeries dwell.
From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro,
Lost, O lost, all under thier spell.

31 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The stallion stagger, his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen 
takes effect.

The mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck. It is a 
virulent ound, red and swollen.

The war-like SHOUTING of the goblins grows even closer.

The unicorns pause at a fork in the trail. The stallion motions with 
his head. Sadly, the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent 
path to safetly.

The stallion stands his ground. When the three goblin hunters gallop 
towards him, he turns and limps into the woods.

32 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack lies beside Lili, listening raptly to her poem.

LILI(reciting): Came he at last to where bluebells grow,
He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell.
He lay him down and did not know
The flower's sound was his own death knell.

And while he slept came teh lady fair,
And gathered him up behind her saddle.
Now, all young hunters of bluebells beware
Sweet William rode straight through the 
gate of Hell.

Jack is lost in Lili's smile.

JACK: When I get to heaven, I know just
how the angels will sound.

LILI(enjoying it): Do you flatter all the girls
like that, Jack?

JACK(embaressed) It's the truth.

Lili kisses Jack sweetly. He doesn't respond.

LILI(smiling): Are you afraid of my kiss?

JACK: I'm afraid you'll break my heart.

LILI: Then still your heart... You
are dear to me as life itself.

JACK: Only because I amuse you...Like some
trained bear!

LILI: That's not true! I do love
you, Jack. You must believe me!

JACK: And if I so....no good can come
from it. I am only a Green Man, without
land or title...no name or wealth to 
bring you.

The Princess her golden ring on and off her finger.

LILI: What does it matter. I don't care
about any of that.

JACK: But it does matter....! If not 
now....Someday. What about when the time 
comes for you to marry?

LILI: I want to marry you.

JACK: That's impossible!

LILI: Not if it's what you really 
want, Jack.

Lili shows Jack her ring.

LILI(cont): Don't you wish this was our
wedding ring?

JACK: What if I say yes...? Will my wish
come true?

LILI: It is my right as a princess to
set a challenge for my suitors.

Lili throws her ring high over their heads. It glitters through the 
air, tumbling over and over in the long drop to the pond.

LILI(cont): I will marry whoever finds this 
ring.

The ring spalshes into the cnetre of the pond. Jack strips off his 
leafy cloak and dives headlong from the cliff.

33 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

Sweat-streaked, the unicorn staggers out of the tree onto a sweeping 
green meadow brilliant with pink bloosoms. Froth bubbles on his 
nostrils. His wide azure eyes betray his panic.

The goblins ride onto the flower-bright meadow. They jump down from 
their mounts in a frenzy.

BLUNDER(excited): We got him now....!
We got him now!

The stallion stumbles forawrd, making a last futile effort to attack 
the goblins. Limbs leaden, head hanging, the noble animal settles 
against a sapling and slides to the ground.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. A wild wind whips the pink blossoms into 
the air.

34 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY 

The golden ring drifts down, tumbling in a lazy spiral.

Jack's pale form stabs through the crystal water. The distant glint 
of the sinking ring lures him on.

The ring settles into the mud at the bottom, concealed by waving 
weeds.

Jack searches blindly as clouds of silt billow about him.

35 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The three goblins advance towards the fallen unicorn through a pink 
blizzrd of wind blown blossoms.

35A EXTERIOR SKY DAY

The black clouds boil and CRASH, thunderheads mounting one upon 
another in a dark maelstrom.

36 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The goblins stands around the fallen unicorn. Blunder turns away as 
Pox seizes the end of the alicorn, lifting it off the ground. Blix 
swings an evil battle-axe high up over his head.

Jagged lightning splits the raging darkness as the black blade 
falls.

Blix waves the severed alicorn in triumph.

The whirling pink petals turn instantly into white snowflakes.

37 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Apolcalyptic winds SCREAM through the forest. Lightning FLASHES.

The world is plunged into winter darkness.

Lili clings to a tree trunk.

LILI(in desparation): Jack! Help me!

The Princess can't maintain her grip. The icy blasts knock her to 
the ground and she crawls to the cliff edge.

LILI(cont)(screaming): Jack!

The her horror, Lili sees a skin of ice form over the surface of the 
pond.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Oh, dear God.... Jack.....
no....

Fighting the raging winds, Lili stumbles to the pond and pounds on 
the ice in frustration. It is no use.

LILI (cont): ....got to get help!

Frantically, Lili runs off into the storm-whipped woods.

38 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY

Jack turns and looks up at the dark surface. He storkes upwards, 
only to bump his head into something solid at the top. The pond is 
covered by a sheet of ice!

39 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack's contorted face is seen through the ice.

He breaks the frozen surface with his fist and his gasping head 
thrusts into the air.

JACK(shouting): Lili....!

His words are lost on the wind.

40 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

Winter shrouds the tiny homestead. Immobile goats, chickens and 
ducks stand silent as snow statues in the farmyard.

Lili runs from the frozen forest and stumbles up the cottage steps. 

41 INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

The Princess barges in, wild-eyed and distraught.

Frost rimes the walls and furnishings. Everything glisten like sugar 
candy. The Woodcarver and his wife are frozen solid.

LILI: Nell....! Arthur....!

Lili touches the wife's gelid cheek.

LILI: Nell....? Oh, nooooo!

Lili is shocked to discover the wife is frozen.

The Princes throws herself sobbing across the bed.

SOUNDS of SNORTING and SHOUTING come from outside
. 
Lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove.

42 LILI'S POV : THROUGH WINDOW

The noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal 
bones. They stop outside and clamber out. Blix has the alicorn 
tucked under his arm.

43 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Terrified, Lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder 
to the loft.

43A INTERIOR COTTAGE LOFT DAY

Barrels and chests are stored here. Cured bacon and hams hang from 
the rafters. Lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a 
butter churn. She wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an 
open trunk.

Snows blows in through a hole in the roof, covering the floor 
timbers. Three-inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the 
cottage interior.

43B LILI'S POV : BETWEEN PLANKS

The front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside.

BLIX: Mortal world turned to ice,
Here be goblins' paradise!

43C INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past 
the frozen tarts.

BLUNDER: Lots to eat!

Pox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby, baring 
his tusks for the feast.

POX: I s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat!

BLUNDER: What're you....? Some kinda animal?

Horrified, Lili GASPS (OS) in the loft.

The goblins cock their ears to listen. Pox SNARLS and drops the baby 
back in the cradle.

Curious, Blunder starts up the ladder to the loft, but changes his 
mind half-way, more interested in what Blix is doing.

BLIX: Why eat cold? It's better hot!

Blix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth. It 
begins to steam and bubble, magically boiling without a fire 
underneath.

POX: Am-m-mazing! How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap?

Blix is equally surprised by the alicorn's power. He CACKLES and 
aims it at the clock on the mantle.

The clock's hand spin wildly around backwards, the carved figures 
darting in and out at fives times their normal speed.

Blix launches on an orgy of destruction, waving the alicorn like a 
magic wand. Plates shatter, the cradle rocks. furniture topples, 
Toby mugs come WAILING alive, painted wooden toys dance and caper.

The goblins SHRIEK with impish joy.

43D INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor.

Blix points the alicorn straight up. Snow flies wildly around the 
crouching Princess.

The broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded 
loft.

It is all the Princess can do to keep from screaming.

43E INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

As a grand finale, Blix points at Nell's frozen figure, blowing her 
skirts above her waist.

POX(languidly): M-m-most amusing Blix....most
terribly amusing.

BLUNDER: This is sure our lucky day.
Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop
on a birthday cake!

BLIX: Prattle, prattle like a priest!
(pointing to himself)
It was me who shoot the beast!

POX: Without the p-p-princess for bait,
you'd never gotten close....
B-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast
to bay.

BLUNDER: She's so sweet....I could
eat her brains like jam!

43F INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili slumps against the wall, aghast at what she's just overheard.

43G INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder and Pox fill a sack with frozen tarts.

POX: I'd like such her b-b-bones!

Blix points the alicorn at the cottage door. It flies open with a 
CRASH.

BLIX: Better hurry! Can't be late!

Blix marches out of the door. The other two goblins follow, darrging 
their sacks of tarts.

BLUNDER: When we deliver that horn, 
Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big
reward.

Blunder and Pox leave, slamming the door behind them.

After a long pause, Lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the 
loft.

LILI: Oh, God.... God....

The Princess stumbles across the cottage towards Nell.

LILI(cont) What have I done...? I didn't
want the unicorn to die.... All I did
was touch it....

Lili pleads with the frozen Wife, as if begging for her forgiveness. 
She is interrupted by the gruff voice of a House BROWNIE.

BROWNIE(OS): You're a wicked, wicked girl!

Lili looks up and sees a long-bearded Brownie standing next to the 
clock on the mantle.

43H LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: The world is in a fine mess
because of you.

43I BROWNIE'S POV : LILIbr 
LILI(desperately) : I'll make it somehow....
I swear it...! I don't care what happens to
me.

43J LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Words...mere words.... Bolds
deeds be needed now! Look at you!
Pampered and soft! Never done a day's
work in your life....

LILI(OS): Who are you?

BROWNIE: Me...? I'm the house brownie...
I keep dust devils under the bed and all
the china cracked.... You know how a watched pot
never boils? I do that...and I'm
a wizard at turning sweet milk sour....

The front door CRASHES loudly open.

43K INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

Little Blunder swaggers into the cottage.

Lili covers her face with the quilt and holds herself rigid as if 
frozen. The Brownie ducks out of sight.

Blunder stalks to the kitchen table and pulls his axefree. He does a 
double-take on spotting the Princess. The tiny goblin can't remember 
can't remember if he saw her earlier or not.

He pokes her and lifts her skirt to peek at her legs. He is stopped 
short by Blix's angry CRY outside:

BLIX(OS): Blunder! Move your butt! On the double!

Blunder hurries to the door.

Lili relaxes when she hears it SLAM.

LILI: Thank God....

Lili looks up at the mantle.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Can you....help me?

437 LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Can I what?

LILI(OS): Help me....

BROWNIE(sadly): I'd like to....but I'm
a domestic sort of chap....no good at all
where demons are concerned....

43M BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

LILI: Then I'll do it myself! I'll follow those 
goblins....somehow.....
even if it costs my life!

43N LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: I like your spirit! There's always 
hope when a brave heart back a noble cause....
but what chance have you? They have the alicorn!
The power is theirs!

43O BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess resolutely hurries about the cottage, gathering things 
to eat and other useful items.

LILI: I will do it! You'll see....I
fooled them now, didn't I.... Well,
I'll do it again easy as pie....

Lili starts for the door.

BROWNIE(OS): Wait....! Take this....!

Lili turns back.

43P LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

The Brownie pulls a golden feather from his cap and tosses it down 
to Lili.

BROWNIE: 'Tis from the tail of the cockatrice....
Make you as fleet as a running deer. And better, when
things seem at their darkest, 'twill remind
you always that hope is alive....

43Q BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess tucks the feather into her bodice.

LILI: Thank you....Hope is just what
I need.

Lili rushes from the cottage back into the snow.

44 EXTERIOR FOREST (SNOW TRAVELER) DAY

A full-scale blizzard drives down through the naked tree limbs. Jack 
slogs forward, near frozen.

JACK(calling): Lili....! Lili....!

Jack sees a tiny bird, frozen solid on a branch. He takes it 
tenderly down, trying to warm it with his breath.

JACK(cont): What's happened....

Standing rigid all around him are numbers of frozen animals.

He can do nothing for the bird and trudges on into the storm.

JACK(cont)(calling): Lili....! 

Up ahead, the figure of a man is barely discernible.

Jack runs to the man, thinking himself saved..

Jack discovers the man is frozen, like the bird. His initial shock 
gives way to releif. The man is his salvation after all.

Quickly, he unties the stranger's travel bags and cloak.

JACK(cont): God rest your soul.... I know you
won't mind if I borrow your things.

Jack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel 
bag.

He scrapes together a pile of twigs, striking sparks with the flint 
and steel to start them smouldering.

45 DELETED : TRANSPOSED TO 46D

46 EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

A campfire blazes. Jack sleeps beside a tiny fire, shivering under 
his new cloak.

A tiny glowing LIGHT streaks out of the woods. It circles around 
Jack. The LIGHT touches the fire and it BLAZES up like a bonfire, 
waking Jack.

JACK: What....?

46A JACK'S POV : LIGHT

Jack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him. He sees a tiny 
woman-child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside. This is 
LUNA.

JACK (cont)(OS): Who're you?

46B EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

Luna ZOOMS off into the treetops.

Jack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet.

JACK (cont): Who's there....?

Watching him through the drifting smoke in GUMP, an elf no more than 
the waist high. Slightly built, he is near-naked in spite of the 
cold. His face is that of a child, yet his eyes shine with a wisdom 
centuries old.

GUMP(smiling mysteriously): Here you be a forest
child and not know the Gump....

JACK: Gump, is it?

GUMP: Aye, Jack.... Honeythorn Gump at 
your service.....

The air is filled with frenzied CLICKS and SNAPS: stones tapping, 
stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc.

Numbers of green-glowing eyes stare at Jack out of the shadows.

JACK (frightened): How d'you know my name?

GUMP: How does a migrating swallow know 
the way south in winter....? Or a 
spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of
his birth from the black cold depths of the
mysterious sea....? I know everything, Jack!

JACK: Everything....? Why has this
happened? Why is it winter now?

GUMP: I'd be a powerful wizard indeed could I answer....
(shrewdly): Suppose you tell me , Jack.

Jack in uncomfortable.

JACK: Me? How can I do that?

GUMP: You know these woods as well as
any elf.... Did you not see 
something odd today? Any strange spirits?
Did nothing untoward happen?

JACK: No....well.... I took Lili to see
the unicorns.....

GUMP (furious): You did what?

Numbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods. They come 
in all sizes, from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen 
as big as small children.

BROWN TOM is a plump, tipsy leprechaun, draped with pots and pans 
like a tinker; SCREWBALL, a tiny pixie wearing an ill-fitting cap 
and garments tassle with flowers.

FAERIES (whispering in chorus): What....? 
Codfish and cockles....! Never....! Pewterpots and....
pumpkins....! Poo-poo pudding....! Doo-doo 
dumplings....! Shit-willy whatnot....!

GUMP: Silence!

The whipering stops. All eyes are on Jack. He writhes with guilt 
under thier scrunity.

JACK(deepling ashamed): Oh God, 
she touched him....

A GROAN rises from the crowd of faeries. They are outraged. Gump is 
the maddest of all. His face darkens. His eyes glow. He trembles 
with banshee fury.

GUMP: Touched it! A mortal laid hands 
on a unicorn?

BROWN TOM: Bad....terrible bad!

JACK: We meant no wrong.

GUMP (screaming): What was it you did 
mean, Jack!

JACK: Nothing....

GUMP (cold and hard): Nothing, he calls it!

JACK: I wanted to share something special 
with her.

GUMP: Well.... I have something now to share with you....a lively 
reel to warm your bones!

Gump magically pulls a violen out of thin air.

JACK: I'm in no mood for dancing.

GUMP(screaming with wrath): Squawk! Squawk!
No more talk.... Do you think you can
upset the order of the
universe and not pay the price?

Brown Tom produces ancient bag pipes, Screwball a tambourine. The 
other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly-shaped 
instryemnts : seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, 
blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles.

A wild and haunting overture begins. The rhythm is complusive.

Jack cannot control his body. His feet move against his will.

JACK(frantic): No! I want no part of
your nonsense.

Gump leers demonically.

GUMP: Time to dance, Jack!

Playing his fiddle, Gump is possessed, demonic.

Screwball beats on a log with a pair of shin bones. The faerie 
orchestra breaks into an other-world melody. Jack leaps and jumps 
like a zombie.

JACK: No...! Please....!

BROWN TOM(chanting): Round and round and round and round,
Before you're lost, you must be found
. 
The tempo increases. The musicians leap and cavort.

Jack twists and capers, dancing against his will.

SCREWBALL(chanting): In and out and up and down, 
Behind each smile there lurks a frown.

Gump leaps wildly, fiddling like a demon. Jack is a prisoner of the 
frenzied music.

BROWN TOM(chanting): Spin and spin and spin and spin, To learn to 
lose you first must win.

Gumps hops into the fire, dancing and playing as sparks leap about 
him. The music grows wilder. Jack will never survive.

SCREWBALL(chanting): Twist and reel and toe and heel,
The end to pain is to learn to feel!

Jack's face is a mask of agony. With supreme effort, he hurls 
himself onto the ground, his body jerking spasmodically to the 
music.

JACK(screaming):Enough!

The faerie orchestra falters, their tempo broken.

GUMP(angry): Is the music not to your liking?

JACK(gasping): I....won't....go....on...Take
my life, if you must.... What I did
is unforgiveable....
(boldly) But, I did it for love! And I'd do
it again! I love Lili with all my heart and
would sooner die than break a 
promise!

Gump stares at Jack. A tender expression softens his flinty eyes.

GUMP: Hmmmm..... Love, you say....? Love is 
another story....

JACK: I meant no disrespect....

GUMP: Answer me this riddle and
all is forgiven.

JACK: And if I cannot?

GUMP: Why, Jack....then 'tis your
death song I'll be playing.

JACK: Ask away, and pray God my answer
pleases you.

GUMP: What is a bell that does not ring,
Yet, its knell makes the angels sing?

Gump laughs, knowing Jack can't solve his riddle. Jack frowns in 
concentration, then grins, as the memory of Lili's song rushes back.

JACK: Bluebells!

GUMP: What?

JACK: The flower. Bluebells. To hear
then ringing means your life is
at an end.

Gump hurls his violin to the ground and stomps on it.

GUMP: Damnation! Codfish and cockles!
Gammon and trotters!

Screwball and Brown Tom run for cover as Gump explodes in an insane 
fury. He throws himself to the ground, kicking and SCREAMING.

GUMP(cont): Rabbot noodles....! Schweinhundt
saukraut mit schlagober....!
Piddle-puddles und ka-ka crumpets....!
Piss pots and thunder mugs!
Demkopf doo-doo brains riddle-widdler!

Abruptly, Gump stands and dusts himself off as if nothing had 
happened. He smiles at Jack and holds out his tiny hand.

GUMP(cont): You bested me, Jack....
Bested me.... bested me...

JACK(modestly): A riddle with an answer
is like an empty cup when you're 
thirsty for wine.

GUMP: Well spoke! And if it's wine you
want, it's wine we shall have.

Gump claps his hands and four tiny glasses magically APPEAR, 
floating in the air before them.

Another clap and Brown Tom's hat POPS off his head, revealing a wine 
bottle balanced underneath.

GUMP(cont): A small measure of entertainment 
at best.

Gumps snaps his fingers and the wine bottle floats off Brown Tom's 
head, pausing to in mid-air to fill each bobbing glass.

GUMP(cont): Elderberry wine....no finer drink 
under heaven.

Each one takes a glass. Gump raises his in a toast.

GUMP(cont): Here's to Jack....riddle-solver....
dancing fool, and faerie friend.

They all clink glasses. Jack regards his with suspicion.

JACK: I'm honoured, Gump....But no more tricks!

GUMP(to the others): Here be precious summertime frozen
into a winter memory and the blamed 
fool won't drink faerie wine for fear of
enchantment.

They all drink, Jack with some relunctance. The faeries enjoy the 
wine. Jack gags, as if he's swallowed fire.

JACK(coughing): Pranks....! Is that all you're good
for....! I've lost Lili....! Gump!
Help me! Use your magic to find her....
set the world right.

GUMP: Changing this frozen hell is beyond
my modest powers.

JACK: Is there nothing you can do?

GUMP: If you want more tricks, I'm your
man.... but, for big questions, you must 
go elsewhere.

JACK: But don't you care what's happened?

GUMP: Course we care.... What good's the 
world locked in a season of death?
No folks to scare on a summer's
night....

BROWN TOM: No babies to tickle....

SCREWBALL: No lovers to tease....

GUMP: No more spells to cast....Does that
sound like an enjoyable prospect?

JACK: We must find the answer!

GUMP: That we must. But first, we better 
see that no harm's come to the
unicorns.

SCREWBALL: I sadly fear the worst....

Gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding
luminous flower lanterns.

46C EXTERIOR DEEP FOREST NIGHT

Seen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like 
foxfire between the massive trees.

46D EXTERIOR SNOW (LILI TRACKS GOBLINS) NIGHT

Princess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the 
tracks of the goblins. The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled. She 
pauses at the top of a small, steep hill. 

The tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below.

Lili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like 
a discarded skin. It is an incrediable leap.

She lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs 
off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled.

47 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA NIGHT

The faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow.

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to 
be done?
Sing a little song
And have fun, fun, fun....

The silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie 
lanterns.

Led by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion.

Wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins.

GUMP: This is goblins' work....
Powerful demons are agaisnt us!

Jack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn.

The SOUND of CRASHING HOOFBEATS alerts the faeries as the mare 
unicorn thunders out of the trees.

BROWN TOM: Take cover, laddies!

The faeries dive for protection. Only Jack stands his ground.

The mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she 
gallops past.

The unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet.

She charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her 
alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat.

GUMP: Run, Jack!

JACK: The fault was mine. I owe her 
my life.

GUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility
is her gift in return.

The mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat. It is a cross 
between whale song and the cooing of doves.

Jack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly.

SCREWBALL: What's he saying? What's
it mean?

BROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak
some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn.

The unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in 
nature. Jck listens intently and answers her.

GUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in
the dark.

JACK: The dark is where we'll stay....
We're cursed. All warmth and light
was lost when the stallion died.

BROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do?

JACK: We must get the alicorn back.
Only then will the world return to normal.

GUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon?

JACK: She says we're to find a champion....
a mortal, bold of heart and pure in
spirit.

SCREWBALL: Look....! Look....!

Screwball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow. Tiny wild 
flowers spring to life within each indentation.

JACK: That is the warmth of her soul.
Not even death's icy hand can stop
it!

SCREWBALL: Little good her soul'll do us now.

BROWN TOM: Screwball's right. Where we gonna 
find a champion when every mortal can swing a
sword is froze stiff as an icicle?

GUMP: Don't give up so quick, lads.
(feeling Jack's arm)
You sure you're mortal?

JACK(indignant): Course I am!

BROWN TOM(dubious): What sort of mortal
speaks unicorn?

SCREWBALL: Why aren't you frozen then?

JACK: I don't know.... I was underwater....
and when I came up for air, everything
was covered with ice.

GUMP: You'll do.... We best get you
some weapons.

JACK(puzzled): Weapons....? What are they?

BROWN TOM (dubious): He's no champion,
Gump.

GUMP: We'll have to make him one....
or kill him trying....!
Follow me!

Gump leads Jack and the others into the woods. The unicorn follows. 

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's
nothing to be done?
Sing a little song 
And have fun, fun, fun....

48 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

Lili creeps around the base of the tree, making no sound. She moves 
with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where 
she can watch the goblins.

Blix holds court, surrounded by a lantern's glow. Pox sits on a bit 
of crumbling masonary. Blunder watches Blix gesture with the 
alicorn.

BLIX: Look at us! Waiting around like
lackies....and for what? We're the 
ones with the power!

BLUNDER: You shouldn't talk like, Blix.
We gets in plenty big trouble!

BLIX: I'm not afraid! Not even Darkness lasts 
forever!

Blix aims the alicorn at Blunder, causing a burst of fire to erupt 
beneath the tiny, helmeted goblin.

Blunder YELPS and runs off, clutching his flaming backside.

Blix roars with laughte. Power has gone completely to his head.

BLIX (cont): Watch out, Pox!

Blix points the alicorn at Pox. Fire explodes beneath the pig-faced 
goblin. He leaps SCREAMING into the air.

Blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger.

BLIX (cont): Higher.... higher....
Burning fire! 
Making music
Like the choir!

Blunder and Pox watch Blix make the fire fountain into the air.

The heavens blaze. Lili is dazzled.

Something very strange is happening within the swirling column of 
flame. Gradually, a demonic face emerges,

Outlined in the fire we see the leering face of Darkness!

Pox and Blunder applaud Blix's rebellion.

POX/BLUNDER (chanting): Higher.... higher..
Burning fire!
Making music 
Like a choir!

The three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic Lord of 
Darkness flaming above them.

Blix tosses the alicorn into the air. Blunder unwittingly catches 
it.

BLIX: Greetings, Worship....

POX: W-w-welcome, Great Lord....
D-d-darkest of the ....

DARKNESS: Your devotion disgusts me? You 
insignificant strands of toad slobber!

Blix and Pox drop grovelling to their knees, covering their heads 
with leaves and dirt.

Blunder can't control himself. He rushes forward and points the 
alicorn up at Darkness.

BLUNDER: Hear me, you angels of light!
Your reign is over! A new order 
begins! All the imps of Hell will 
dance freely over this dark land....
I hold the power....

DARKNESS: Enough!

Darkness points a burning finger at Blunder. The alicorn is rippef 
from the goblin's graps and flies up to Darkness. Blunder YELPS in 
terror.

Something terrible happens: the ground around Blunder begins to 
soften. To his horror, the little goblin sinks under as if into 
quicksand.

BLUNDER: Please.... It was only a joke...
I didn't mean it.... Honest....!

Blunder is in up to his neck. 

BLUDNER (cont): Whatsamatter? Have you no sense of
humour? I hope you choke of faerie 
breath and flower petals!

Blunder's hand points up from the earth. Darkness ZAPS it, turning 
it to another chicken-claw!

Blunder is gone without a trace; sucked under with a disgusting 
SLURP.

Darknesss HOWLS his triumph to the heavens.

From her place of concealment, Lili overhears every word.

DARKNESS: Did you think this alicorn a mere
plaything....? With it my empire 
is eternal! Before I ruled only 
the night. Now, my minions will
frolic in darkness until the end 
of time.

Darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by Blix, 
tracing an arc of flames through the night.

Like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton, Darkness controls 
the fire's movements. The blaze twists and swirls across the black 
night, blazing meteor trails, bright as the aeora.

BLIX (fawning): Forgive this intrusion.... My
goblins are a free-spirited lot.
I like to encourage their....
initiative. What do you think of
this policy, Master?

Columns of flame shower around the Dark Lord and from within thier 
incendiary interiors, evil wraith-like spirits emerge, swirling like 
ghosts.

Bright as comets, numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their 
fiery master. Darkness stands in total control within their mighty 
conflagration, the alicorn his sceptre.

Suddenly, with the pure clarity of a BELL CHIME, the presence of 
DAYLIGHT is detected.

The reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it 
luminence over Darkness and the goblins.

DARKNESS (cont) (writhing): What is this light...?

Beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks.

Darkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him.

DARKNESS (cont): You killed the final unicorn....
Is this not true?

Blix and Pox exchange guilty looks.

BLIX: This is true....

POX: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord.

Darkness is on to them. He points with the alicorn.

DARKNESS: You lie! Here is dawn!

POX: Well.... almost t-t-true....
ess-s-sentially true....

BLIX: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams,
dead as legend....

DARKNESS: OUT WITH IT!

Sunlight is half-way to the ground. Darkness shrinks, shrivelling 
like a dying ember.

POX: But.... but.... the m-m-mare still
lives...

DARKNESS: If even one unicorn walks the 
earth, my power is not complete....

BLIX: Just a female.... She has no
power...
. 
The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire.

DARKNESS: Only the power of creation....?
Get that female....! I command
you.... In the name of Darkness....

Sunlight strikes the ground. Darkness is gone! His arm holding the 
alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear.

Lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree.

49 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili runs straight into a driving blizzard. A distant SOUND alerts 
her and she pauses to listen.

It is Jack and the faeries, SINGING. Jack's voice carries above the 
others.

JACK & THE FAERIES (os): When times are hard and things look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

A look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face. As the SOUND of 
singing FADES, she runs towards it, calling eagerly.

LILI: Jack....! Ja-aack!

50 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all SINGING 
merrily.

JACK & THE FAERIES (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown,
That's the time to dance like a clown!

Jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen.

LILI (very faint) (os): Ja-aack.... Ja-aack....

JACK (bewildered): Lili....?

The SOUND of her distant call is erased by the howling storm. Jack 
sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up 
with the others.

51 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili stops running. There is nothing but the wailing wind.

LILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack....

A solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek 
like a diamond beauty spot.

LILI (cont): Please God.... help me!

Lili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the 
unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming 
flowers.

Her courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of 
burgeoning life through the forest.

52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Gumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant 
tree.

GUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack.... What
d'you think of that for a front
door?

Jack thinks Gump is pulling his leg.

JACK (in jest): Be some job in getting it open.

GUMP: Think you so?

Gump WHISTLES. Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the 
boulder, and he is seen to have facial features.

BOULDER: Morning', Gump....

The Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from 
under the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern.

He promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny 
stone feet kicking wildly in the air.

GUMP (bowing): After you, Jack....

Jack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots.

JACK: Thank you....

The other faeries follow, leading the unicorn.

53 INTERIOR MOUTH TO CAVE DAY

An earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the 
unicorn. There is a small wooden door at the far end, sealed with a 
bright brass padlock.

GUMP: Brown Tom. Stay here with the
unicorn and guard her well.

BROWN TOM: Like me own life!

GUMP: Better than that! She's the last 
of her kind.

Gump marches to the little wooden door. He inserts a finger into the 
padlock, twisting it like a key. Instantly, the pops apart. Gump 
opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond.

54 INTERIOR TUNNEL DAY

Tree roots twist down like dead men's fingers and clutch the ancient 
rune stones lodged in the earthen walls.

Gump and Screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel, but Jack is 
forced to crawl on his hands and knees. Luna flies above thier heads 
like a tiny neon insect.

GUMP: Right this way....

Gump pauses by another wooden door, sealed with a brass lock. He 
opens it instantly with his magic touch.

SCREWBALL: Home, sweet home!

55 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden 
chairs and tables, a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging 
from the ceiling. The simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles 
of treasure: gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins.

GUMP: Fit for a king's ramsom!

Jack in awe as he wades through the ankle-high loot.

JACK: Such riches.... I feel I must be
dreaming....

GUMP: If life is a dream, better you dread
the waking!

Screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over 
his head. He laughs like a child in a sandpit.

JACK: ....beautiful....

GUMP: Mere trinkets.... Let's find you
something useful.

Luna's golden LIGHT streaks down and whirls around Jack's head. He 
swats futilely at her.

JACK: Stop it....! Go away....!

GUMP: Easy.... Luna only seeks a little 
affection.

Luna hovers beside Jack's cheek.

JACK: I meant no disrespect, but....
ouch! Make her stop, will you,
Gump!

GUMP: Does your blood run so cold? You'll 
be a corpse before your time.

Gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full.

JACK: What does she want from me?

GUMP: Foolish question....
(handing Jack a goblet)
Drink, and wamr your heart.
The answer's at the bottom of 
your cup.

Jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously. This time, he is careful not to 
drink when the faeries do.

GUMP (cont): Now then.... down to business.

Gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard. It is a 
remarkably beautiful weapon. 

JACK: What's this....? Something to cook
with?

Gump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look.

GUMP(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine
a weapon as you'll ever see.

JACK(curious: So, that's a weapon.... What's it
do?

SCREWBALL: World is doomed, if you ask me.

Screwball goes back to playing with the jewels.

Gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt.

GUMP: A little demonstration.

Gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down. 
The little elf is an expert swordsman. He whirls the weapon in a 
gleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half.

GUMP(cont): With such a blade you could behead
an ogre as easily as uncapping a 
soft-boiled egg.

JACK: That's really something.... Can I
try?

Gump hands the sword to Jack.

GUMP: You're the champion, aren't you?

Jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and 
tosses it into the air. As it flutters down, he swings wildly with 
the broadsword. Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head 
chopped off.

GUMP(cont): Watch out....! You'll get the hang of 
it in time.... Now, we best see 
about some armour..... Screwball!

SCREWBALL: Coming right up!

Screwball flips open the lid of a chest. Folded inside is a golden 
chain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship.

GUMP: Go on.... see if it fits.

Jack slips the coat over his head. It fits perfectly.

GUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow
ar fifty yards.

SCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in 
that.

GUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack.
(pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror.

JACK(confused): ....Shield?

GUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there.

SCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man....

Gump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a 
small carved desk.

There is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME. Gump pulls a remarkable instrument 
from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with 
whirling miniature worlds.

GUMP(studying globe): Hmmm... getting late. Almost half-
way past the morning mayfly hatch...
. 
SCREWBALL(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now....
'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice.

GUMP: You first must know how 
to tell the time.

SCREWBALL: I ain't got nothing....

GUMP: No more chatter....! I've got work
to do.

Gump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging 
among his papers.

Jack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his 
reflection.

Luna round and round his head.

SCREWBALL: Think I'll brew some tea.

Screwball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling.

SCREWBALL(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass...
Maybe a spot of spearmint....
St John's Wort not bad.... and
a little foxglove.

Screwball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs.

57 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

The unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave.

She pauses to consider the situation. Snowflakes glisten in her 
tangled hair. She is fiercly beautiful.

Deciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside.

58 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

A small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron 
skillet. The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw. 
Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank.

The unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in.

Brown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting 
with rage.

BROWN TOM: What....? What....? 
Who's there?

LILI: I'm Princess Lili.... I.....

BROWN TOM: You! You're the cause of 
all our sorrow!

The Princess drops to her knees.

LILI: I know it was wrong.... Everything
is my fault.
(weeping)
Please.... please forgive me.

BROWN TOM: I ain't the one ye should be asking.

LILI: I want to make it up to her....
I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn 
to the Lord of Darkness!

BROWN TOM: Good lass! You're a plucky
little partridge at that.

LILI: We can't stay here! It's not safe!
Darkness sent the goblins to hunt
the mare... If I found her, so will
they....We msut go!

59 DELETED

60 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave.

BROWN TOM: Too late!

Pox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed 
arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom.

Brown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's 
stance.

BROWN TOM: If you imps're looking for a
fight, ye've come to the chap
who'll oblige ye.

BLIX/POX: Kill....! K-k-kill...!
Kill...!

Blix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible 
speed.

Brown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to 
deflect the arrows raining about him.

Lili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's 
body with her own.

Brown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet. A fusillade of 
arrows CLANGS OFF its iron surface.

A lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat. Dark red liquid streams down 
his face. His eyes roll up in mortal terror.

BROWN TOM: Dick-o-Tuesday's duck! They've done
for me!

Brown Tom staggers in a dramatic half-circle, toppling straight over 
backwards, stiff as a board.

The mare unicorn rears WHINNYING on her hind-quarters.

The goblin hunters advance. Blix spreads a heavy net wide.

The black shadow on the net falls across Lili and the unicorn like 
an evil spider web.

61 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Screwball's teapot steams merrily. He sits stop a jewel cask 
enjoying a cup. A horned Viking helmet several sizes too large 
covers his head down to the bridge of his nose.

Gump works at his desk, marking out distances on an ancient chart 
with a pair of golden dividers. Dozens of parchment mps are spread 
in front of him.

GUMP(muttering): Forty leagues from the Dragon's
Track.... another half-span past 
the basilisk den.

Gump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together.

GUMP (cont)(annoyed): Wirrikows and dopplegangers!

SCREWBALL: Spot of tea, Gump....?
Help calm your nerves...

GUMP: Not now! I'm busy with navigation.

On the other side of the cave, Jack practices a variety of thrusts 
and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield.

Luna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite.

JACK: That's not so bad.... What do you
think, Luna?

Jack studies his reflection in the shield.

There is a BURST OF LIGHT behind him. Luna materialises as a child-
sized woman with gossamer wings. She wraps her slender arms around 
his neck.

LUNA: I think you look like a hero.

JACK: What! H'd you do that?

Jack spins around, but Luna is gone. Only the tiny dot of LIGHT 
hovers in the air.

JACK(cont) (puzzled): Magic....

Jack looks back at the shield and there is a full-sized Luna hugging 
his reflection.

LUNA: Nobody knows nut you. it's our
secret....
(kissing his cheek)
Promise?

JACK (squirming): Don't do that.

LUNA(another kiss): Better promise....

JACK: All right, all right....
I promise.

A loud, MUSICAL CHIEME interrupts Gump's work. he looks around for 
his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight.

GUMP: Hmmmm...? Screwball!

SCREWBALL (all innocence): Something I can
do for you, Gump?

GUMP: Hand it over....!

Sheepishly, Screwball pulls Gump's timepeice from inside his tunic 
and gives it back.

SCREWBALL: Well, well, well....
how'd that get in there? Must be
some kinda magic...

GUMP: Sneak thief's magic!
(studies timepiece)
Jack! it's time we were on
our way!

At the SOUND of Gump's voice, Luna TRANSFORMS instantly back to a 
dot of light.

JACK: I'm ready as I'll ever be....

Jack picks up the shield and starts after Gump and Screwball. Luna 
flies overhead.

62 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom lies flat on his back as Jack and the faeries emerge from 
the tunnel. 

Gump rushes to his fallen friend, lifting him in his arms.

GUMP: Brown Tom....? You can't be dead....!
Oh, this is is terrible.... terrible!

Brown Tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about.

BROWN TOM (in a daze): Why, Wisp.... 
they kill you, too?

GUMP: Course they didn't! What in blazes
are you talking about?

Brown Tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat.

BROWN TOM: Goblins shot me through
the brain pan.

Gump yanks off Brown Tom's hat. Bits of broken wine bottle tumble 
out. Gump reagrds his friend with scorn.

GUMP: Your brains are one spot an
arrow'd do no harm!

JACK: Where's the unicorn?

Sheepishly, Brown Tom pulls the arrow from his hat.

BROWN TOM: I'm afeered the goblins took her.
Did me best to fight them off, but
they swarmed up by the hundreds.... Horrid
creatures they were. The Princess warned 
me, but....

JACK: Princess Lili?

BROWN TOM: Aye.

JACK(overjoyed): She's alive!

BROWN TOM: She was living still 
when they killed me.

GUMP: You'll earn your champion's spurs
this day, Jack.... We'll follow their
tracks in the snow. Foul weather's on our
side for a change.

62A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY

Jack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns, into 
the teeth of a driving blizzard.

63 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Blix and Pox kneel nervously before the Throne of Darkness. A huge 
fire blazes in the hearth.

POX: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest
of the dark!

BLIX: Though we be nothing in your sight,
We bow before your strength and might!

We hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread 
like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins.

DARKNESS (os): Can you fawning sycophants
do more than grovel? What of the task I set you?

POX: D-d-done, Lord. We have the 
m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn.

DARKNESS(os): Where is she?

BLIX: In the dungeon like a treasure, 
Awaiting your darkest pleasure.

DARKNESS (os): Very good.... You two are not
entirely devoid of talent.

POX: There's m-m-more, Sire....

BLIX: Though unworthy of your magnificence,
Trifles without consequence,
We present with all due deference....
A gift. 

DARKNESS (os): Gift....? What sort of gift?

BLIX: This thing you once called innocence.

DARKNESS (os): Innocence...? I must behold this 
wonder....

Darkness stares into the fire.

As Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, 
dripping to the dank stone floor.

64 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a 
stain across the curving stones.

Below, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable 
binding her to an iron windlass.

The Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in 
tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about 
her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring.

The melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a 
small demonic shape as it falls.

We hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. 
The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within 
the vaulted chamber.

Lili is terrified. She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm 
continues. The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for 
comfort.

64A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat THUNDERING.

65 EXTERIOR HILL ABOVE GREAT TREE BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and 
surrounding bog.

65A EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of 
mist.

JACK: Legend says the Dark Castle stood
in olden days when evil anarchy
ruled the land.... The wicked still
come here to sacrafice.

GUMP: They worship the demon....

SCREWBALL: It's ugly! I hate it!

GUMP: Good! You shall go first....

65B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

CLOSE ON: Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering 
eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows.

65C EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Although Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too 
deep for the faeries. Gump urges Screwball forward:

GUMP: Go on! Hurry up!

SCREWBALL: All the time me.
Same old story.

Screwball clibs up onto a floating lily pad.

An undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as 
they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, 
twisting root.

Without warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and 
grabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream.

BROWN TOM: Screwball!

JACK: What was that?

GUMP: Big trouble!

Jack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where 
Screwball disappeared.

JACK: We've got to do something.

Before Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind 
him. She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous 
embrace.

MEG: Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to
me, juicy boy!

Jack YELPS in horror.

MEG (cont): Who be this tender morsel
disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest?

JACK(terrified): They call me Green 
Jack ma'am.

The faeries watch in dismay.

BROWN TOM: Our champion's a goner, he is.

The fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons.

MEG: What a fine fat boy you are....

JACK: You don't mean to eat me,
do you ma'am?

MEG: Oh, indeed I do....

JACK: That would be a shame, Miss Meg.
You're so lovely. You deserve far 
better than scrawny little
me....

The flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it.

MEG: Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack?

JACK: All the heavenly angels must 
envy your beauty.

MEG: Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make,
be the rest of you as sweet
as your tongue.

JACK: Let me go and I'll sing songs
of praise to you.

MEG: Let you go? Don't be daft. I've
had naught but muskrat and snakes 
all this month.... bit of rancid
goblin, too....

JACK: But....but....don't you like
my words?

MEG: Words are little help in 
filling an empty stomach....

JACK: Then fill your soul with loveliness.
Look into your glass and feast on
beauty.

MEG: There's no looking-glass here....
Sometimes, when the moon is full,
I'll chance to see my reflection
in the bog.

Jack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder.

JACK: My shield would serve you well.

Meg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from 
her clammy clutches.

MEG: What a splendid idea! 
You be so clever, Jack.

Hanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield.

JACK: Your radiance is the alchemy
that makes rusted steel shine like 
silver.

Meg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her 
vanity table.

MEG: Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy
of any princess in the land.

While Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump 
catches the Jack's eyes. The cunning elf silently mouths the word: 
'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time.

JACK: Better, you are a queen without
a peer.... a reigning angel.

Jack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword. Meg doesn't notice 
thing.

MEG: You have such discerning taste 
for so young a boy....

Meg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips.

MEG (cont): Come, Jack....give us
a kiss before dining.

Jack petrified with fear.

GUMP(shouting): Give her the kiss of 
cold steel, Jack!

Jack swings blindly with his eyes closed. It is a lucky stroke, Meg 
Mucklebones' head flies from her shoulders.

JACK(astonished): I did it!

The decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface.

GUMP: Like a chmapion, Jack.

BROWN TOM: Bravo!

JACK: How's Screwball?

SCREWBALL: Chewed, but not disgested....

Jack points his sword at the hollow tree.

JACK: Then on to victory!

FAERIES (all together): On to victory!

65D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

A huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth. Darkness stands before it, 
almost a shadow in his midnight cloak.

DARKNESS: I've been an exile for too long....
banished by the sun.... forced to
hide in the bowels of the earth....
On the eve of my greatest victory, this....
child of nature appears.... It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.... I could know 
her in an instant. She is helpless.... and yet....
(anguished)
What is wrong with me, Father?

A VOICE IN THE FIRE answers Darkness; majestic and sepulrchral; the 
flames billow out as it speaks:

VOICE: You hold the world in your grasp....
Supreme power belongs to you... yet 
your triumph is meaningless!

DARKNESS: Meaningless?

VOICE: What do you gain from it? What pleasure
comes from ruling a pack of imps and
goblins....? Souls already black.... This
innocent creature fascinates you because 
only she can appreciate the enormity
of your achievement.

DARKNESS: I'll take her then!

VOICE: A hollow victory! She remembers 
the world as it was, when she loves your
new order you will triumph! Woo her....
win her.... break her spirit....

DARKNESS: Thank you, Father.... Your
wisdom is ever my guide.

VOICE: Remember.... She must desire you....
nothing else matters!

65E EXTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries step ashore on the island. Gump makes a 
mystical sign with his hands.

JACK: What's that?

GUMP: For our protection, Jack. You must 
be ready.... Remember, Darkness is a liar....
a treacherous fiend! Don't listen to him. 
Never believe what you see.....

JACK: He won't fool me.

GUMP: Don't be so sure! No human has 
ever set foot in this place before! 
66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the 
inner tree.

Screwball starts to climb towards it.

SCREWBALL: What a nice big trumpet....! Bet
it sounds louder than anything....

Gump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants.

GUMP: Don't touch it! Our lives are
lost if it blows!

Jack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree.

JACK: In here! I've found a passage!

Jack drops inside.

66A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

The moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep TREMOR reverberates 
through the subterranean Castle of Darkness.

Draped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this 
disturbance.

DARKNESS (to the fire): I feel a presence....!
Some power invades my sanctity....

VOICE (from the flames): Every wolf suffers 
fleas.... 'tis easy enough to
scratch!

The flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him.

67 INTERIOR TINY ANTECHAMBER DAY

Like the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and 
human skulls. At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic 
head. Jack and the faeries stand looking up.

GUMP(gloomily): The decor of death....

BROWN TOM: Tells you somthing 'bout
him what lives here.

SCREWBALL: It's a dead end....

Jack searches along the ossuary walls.

JACK: Doesn't make sense.... Check
the walls. There must be some sort
of secret key....

Screwball doesn't join the other faeries in the search. He is 
attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble. Picking 
up three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle.

SCREWBALL: One-two-three....
fidde-dee-dee....

Gump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage.

GUMP: Screwball! Drop those this 
minute!

Screwball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder. One lands 
in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering 
momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle.

The balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle. It is 
swallowed with an emphatic GULP.

All at once, the roof slides shut above.

BROWN TOM(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade!

The floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet SCREAMING into 
empty space. Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit.

LUNA (wee voice): Oh, dear.... Oh, dear...

The tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down 
into the dark opening after her falling friends.

68 INTERIOR CAVE CHUTE DAY

Like prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries 
spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute.

GUMP(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

JACK: How can you sing at a time
like this?

GUMP: Can you think of anything 
better to do?

They hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of 
ancient dust.

69 INTERIOR CAGE AND ALCOVE DAY

The end of the chute opens into an iron cage. Jack and the faeries 
tumble through onto a pile of straw. Luna is right behind, bright as 
a firefly.

BROWN TOM: Ouch! Ow!

SCREWBALL: Where are we?

Gump stares woefully at the iron bars.

GUMP: Some place we don't want to be!

A scuffling NOISE in the far side of the cage attracts their 
attention. Blunder pops up from a pile of straw, still wearing his 
helmet.

BLUNDER: Shhhh! What is this?
A chatterbox convention?
SCREWBALL: Who be you, bucket-head?

GUMP: Stay clear of that imp! He's
a hell hound goblin!

BLUNDER: What I am won't help me 
none, nor you neither....

Blunder pulls off his helmet. He is Screwball's indenical twin!

BLUNDER(cont): ....even if you is my brother!

Screwball can't believe his eyes.

SCREWBALL(astonished) Blunder...!

BLUNDER: Screwball....!

They rush into each other's arms.

GUMP (to Jack): A Buttercup family reunion....!
I can't believe it.... Last I remember,
he sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears
that turned out to be cow piss!

SCREWBALL: What happened to you?

BLUNDER(flexing his bird claw): It's a long story....
Let's just say I went look for adventure and 
found more'n I could handle....
Doesn't matter now anyway... We're all of us
in the same fix....

JACK: Just what sort of fix is that?

BLUNDER: The kitchen of the Lord of 
Darkness! All of us be on his menu!

SCREWBALL: I knew it! I knew it! Should
of stayed at home....

BLUNDER: That's right, brother, me'n you 
is barbeque!

BROWN TOM: Wish I had a drink....

JACK: Only dead meat waits for the
stewpot! Spring the lock, Gump!

Gump examines the huge padlock with a frown.

GUMP (wearily): Iron is sore trouble for elves.

SCREWBALL: Magic's no good against it.

Jack slumps down in the corner to think things over. The faeries 
mill about by the opposite wall.

Jack stares at the bars. Luna orbits his head.
JACK: I know I promised.... but it's the only way....

Luna buzzes him furiously.

JACK(cont): Sure it's a secret... It'll
keep forever when we're all dead....

Jack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of LIGHT.

JACK(cont) (to Gump): Why not have Luna fly
out between the bars and find a key?

GUMP(shaking his head): She's much too small....
could never lift it...

JACK(blurting it out): Not if she changes 
sizes like she can!

GUMP: What?

There is a bright FLASH of faerie-light and Luna stands full-sized 
before them, her gossamer wings a-tremble.

GUMP(cont)(outraged): You wilful sprite! How dare 
you keep such secrets?

LUNA: They're mine to keep! But I'll do
what you ask.... if you kiss me, Jack.

JACK: That's easy enough.

Jack kisses her chastely on the cheek.

LUNA: Call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?

JACK(eager to please): Sweeter than bee
pollen on a summer wind.

Luna moves in close to Jack.

LUNA: Sweet is the wind thats blows me to 
you....

Jack gently pushes her away.

JACK: It's not possible. I'm in love....

LUNA: A faerie's love makes anything 
possible....

A soft cocoom of faerie LIGHT engulfs Luna. She metamorphoses within 
it, emerging as Princess Lili.

LUNA/LILI: ....even you heart's desire.

Luna/Lili embraces Jack. It is sweet and tempting.

JACK(resisting): No.... this isn't real....

Screwball and Blunder giggle and snigger.

LUNA/LILI: Oh, but it is.... I'm warm and alive
and happy to be in your arms.

Jack is nearly enchanted, but after a delicious moment, he pushes 
away.

JACK: I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour!

A brilliant aura of faerie LIGHT envelops Luna/Lili and she 
TRANSFORMS into her true winged-form
. 
LUNA(bitterly): You....! You....mortal! I
could vex you! Dance you life away!

JACK: Threats can't make you love you.
Human hearts don't work that way.

LUNA: What care I for human heart?
Soft and spiritless as porridge!
A faerie's heart beats fierce and free.

There is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna 
returns to a tiny dot of LIGHT.

JACK: Luna....?

Without an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars.

JACK(cont) (to the faeries): I.... didn't mean
to hurt her.

GUMP(scornful): Your fine senseibilities
have left us here to rot.

The SOUND of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, 
tuneless SINGING.

COOK(os): ....this li'l piggie went to market....
anudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat
pie, l'l piggie die....

BLUNDER: Oh, no! He's coming...!
Hide! Hide! Hide!

Blunder conceals himself under a pile of straw. A deformed shadow is 
cast across the cage.

SCREWBALL: Blunder's got the right idea!

Screwball hides in the straw. Jack and the other immediately do the 
same.

A fiendish demon COOK opens the cage door. He is ten feet tall and 
unspeakably ugly. He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his 
hideous nose.

COOK: ....pig-pig-pig...
. 
The Cook gropes inside the cage.

The Cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs 
Blunder.

BLUNDER: Help....! Lemme go...?
Turn me loose, you tub o' guts!

The cook hauls Blunder out, kicking and screaming. He locks the cage 
abd stumps away.

BLUNDER(cont): I hope I give you heart-burn!

After a bit, the faeries and Jack peer up out of the straw.

SCREWBALL(woefully): Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us....

BROWN TON: Lambs to the slaughter....

Jack draws his sword.

JACK: Not without a fight!

Transformed back to full-size, Luna tip-toes into the alcove outside 
the cage, her hands coyly behind her.

GUMP: Luna....!

LUNA(maliciously): You look like mourners at your
own funeral.

GUMP(angry): Come back to dance on 
our graves!

LUNA: I'd gladly frolic on Jack's....

She LAUGHS and holds up a large iron key.

LUNA(cont): ....but this cage shan't be 
your tomb!

Luna tosses the key in to Gump. Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot 
of LIGHT and flies out of the alcove.

GUMP: Well done!

Gump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out. Screwball 
steps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness.

SCREWBALL: Lemme outta this stink hole!

BROWN TOM: Mind you bleeding foot!

GUMP: Shhhh! 

Jack is the last of all.

JACK: Keep behind me in case
there's trouble.

Sword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into
the kitchen.

70 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY

Huge ovens belch fire and smoke. The vast hearth blazes. Like the 
lower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all 
hope is abandoned.

Jack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze.

BROWN TOM: Terrible sight for a sober
man to see....

JACK: Quiet!

The demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous 
cleaver, A SECOND COOK, every bit as terrifying, SNORES by the 
hearth. Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby.

Jack motions the faeries on. The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the 
air.

COOK: Whut be there?

Jack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows.

SCREWBALL: ....Back in the frying pan!

Gump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth.

Grasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them.

COOK(sniffing): Be it live victuals?

From where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight.

BLUNDER(calling out): Hey....!
Lard belly!

The Cook turns, angered by this insult.

COOK: Whut say, pip-squeak?

BLUNDER: Two things down here look 
just alike!

COOK: Wuzzat?

BLUNDER: Your face and my ass!

The Cook GROWLS with fury.

COOK: Bash in you face! Den it no be 
so pretty!

The Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching 
bag.

Jack and the faeries make a break for the exit.

Blunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds.

COOK(cont): Whut you got to say now,
pork pie?

Blunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw. Stunned,
he topples over over backwards a great CRASH.

70A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle. 
Darkness listens by the fire. 

DARKNESS: Do you feel it, Father....? 
A force....loose in my domain.... 

VOICE(out of fire): Guard well what is yours! 

DARKNESS(roaring): BRING INNOCENCE TO ME! 

71 INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

The faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor. Irregular 
torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones. 

BROWN TOM (gasping for breath): 
.....saved....by a goblin.... Never 
thought....I'd see....the day.... 

JACK: Wish we could repay the favour! 

SCREWBALL: My brother can take of himself. 

GUMP: Screwball's right! It's more important 
we find the unicorn. 

JACK: And Lili! 

BROWN TOM: Where do we start? 

GUMP: We must find the dungeons. Legend has 
is they house such sirriw that death 
is a gift....albeit one rarely granted. 

Screwball sits down defiantly. 

SCREWBALL: Think I'll stay right here thank you 
very much. 

Gump grabs hold of Screwball's ear and hauls him back up. 

GUMP: Not so fast! You search with the 
rest of us! 

Screwball hugs Jack's leg. 

SCREWBALL: All right! I'm going with Jack! 

GUMP: No you won't. Be faster if we 
split up. 

Screwball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest. 

SCREWBALL: Fine! I'm going this way! 

BROWN TOM: I'm going that way! 

They both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps. 

JACK: Wait....! Better to search in 
teams, Gump and me together. Brown 
TOm, you and Screwball look in the 
other direction. 

Gump hauls out his ornate timepeice. 

GUMP: Right! Let's synchronise! We meet 
back here in twice five hundred 
beats of a bluebird's heart. 

Brown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies 
its intricate interior. 

BROWN TOM: Best to allow another couple dozen 
butterfly breaths in case we get 
thirs....er, get lost.... 

GUMP: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom. 

JACK: Let's hurry! 

Jack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing 
LIGHT. Screwball watches without moving. 

SCREWBALL: Know what I want to know? 

BROWN TOM: What? 

SCREWBALL: Why me? 

Brown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear. 

BROWN TOM: Why not? 

The two little elves scamaper off together. 

SCREWBALL: I hate it....I hate it.... 
I hate it.... 

72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

The iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, 
her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, 
resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. 

Lili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion 
luring her toward the open doorway. 

The chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back 
without expression as she leaves.

74 DELETED 

75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY 
Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the 
rubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart 
into the shadows. 

GUMP: Quick, Jack! 

Jack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a 
watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led 
on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. 

Jack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. 

JACK: I'll scramble that one! 

Gump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. 

GUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is 
enchanted here. 

The Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a 
diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome 
SHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin 
attendant Demons. 

Jack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. 

75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted 
by the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow 
fall across the opposite wall. 

The two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the 
shadows. 

It is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a 
trance. 

76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast 
central of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and 
below, bridge the awesome chasm. 

The Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. 

JACK: Not even kings live like this.... 

On a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a 
somnabulist. 

JACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! 

GUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. 

JACK (yelling): Lili ! 

The SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. 

77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

The Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she 
wanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious 
moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. 

JACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! 
The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow 
edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug 
chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. 

JACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! 

Lili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. 

78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack stares up at Lili's retreating form. 

JACK: It's her. I know it. 

GUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. 

JACK: I've got to reach her! 

Jack races off. Gump runs along behind. 

78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES 
with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork 
tines. 

DARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! 
Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. 

79 DELETED 

80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is 
nowhere in sight. 

GUMP (running after): Slow down....! 
Use some caution! 

JACK: This way! 

Jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili. Gump 
follows after. 

81 INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

Lili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots. A 
glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling. Her blank eyes 
stare straight ahead. 

Jack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to 
see the Princess drift out of sight. 

JACK: There she is....! Lili....! 

Jack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam 
with rain. Suddenly, they are attacked by SCREAMING Pygmies. 

GUMP: Jack! 

JACK (drawing his sword): Demons! 

The nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through 
the drizzle. 

Jack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets. 

GUMP: Quick! In here! 

Gump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck 
inside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies. 

81A INTERIOR SEALED CORRIDOR DAY 

Jack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal 
shut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor 
behind them is completely bricked over. 

GUMP: Trapped....! 

CLOSE ON DOOR: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the 
thick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from 
Jack and Gump. 

The door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS 
the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a 
loud CRASH. 

The Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE. 

Jack and Gump peer cautiously out. 

81B INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

The Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling 
from their imbedded talons. 

JACK: Come on! 

Jack and Gump run into the rain. 

82 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a 
pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach. 

JACK (calling): Lili! Wait! 

Gump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop. 

GUMP: Don't be daft! She's under a spell! 

Lili enters and the doors swing closed behind her. 

83 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

An enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall 
Baroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long 
black table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by 
firelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental 
sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in 
a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles. 

When the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She 
stares in terror at her news surroundings. 

Something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped 
shadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like 
a ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the 
garment! 

Fascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it 
irresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to 
dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music. 

84 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors. 

JACK: Why did you stop me? 

GUMP: We best reconnoitre. What if it's 
a trap? 

Gump and Jack strain to see through the crack between the doors. 

85 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the 
blazing fire. She is now WEARING the splendid black gown! 

Reflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box 
spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure 
like a moth to the flame. 

She steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony 
casket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony 
figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its 
up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind 
can imagine. 

The Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She 
impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool. 

The high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and 
without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her 
neck. 

She leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, 
concentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture 
becomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For 
a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she 
realises what is happening and SCREAMS. 

The musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. 
Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall 
cheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she 
is unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image. 

CLOSE ON MIRROR: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil 
face of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water. 

Darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror. 

Lili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror. 

Darkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black 
finery. 

Lili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess 
SHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, 
she slumps tothe floor, unconscious. 

Darkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like 
muffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous 
features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed 
fingers. 

The Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find 
Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away. 

DARKNESS: Do not be afraid, lady.... 

Lili GASPS like a stranded fish. She is catatonic with fear. 

DARKNESS (cont): I mean you no harm. 

Darkness offers the Princess his hand. 

DARKNESS (cont): How like you my gifts...? Does 
the gown not please you? Come.... 
tell me.... 

Lili's terror renders her speechless. 

DARKNESS (cont): The colour is most suitable... We 
sanctify the death of the old world 
and the birth of a new order.... 
You are the guest of honour. 

Lili WEEPS and tugs at the black dress. 

LILI: ....of dishonour...! Take this 
away.... Please! I beg you! 

Darkness advances on Lili. The slow kettldrum THROB of his heart 
underscores his words. 

DARKNESS: Your soul in like some dark nectar.... 
I cannot rest unril I taste its 
sweetness. 

LILI (frantic): Never! I hate you! I hate this 
dress! 

DARKNESS: Can you speak so of your bridal 
gown....? 

LILI (screaming): Nooooooooo! 

86 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump listen by the closed doors to Lili's peircing scream 
(OS). Jack is desparate and half-draws his sword from the scabbard. 

JACK: What has he done to her?

Gump restrains the boy.

GUMP: You have no power to stop it....
Be thankful she lives.

Jack shoves his sword back in disgust.

JACK (bitterly): Some champion....
What good is this fancy sword?

GUMP: It's not the sword that counts, but
the man who swings it....

87 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili slumps to the cold stone floor, WEEPING. Darkness bends 
solicitously over her.

DARKNESS: Why the tears?

LILI (sobbing): ....everything is lost....
poor Jack....

DARKNESS: Why weep for him? He left you
alone to die!

LILI: No! He'd never do that! He was
killed....like everything else....

DARKNESS (glancing over his shoulder): Yes.... But
why mourn? You have a new and grander destiny!

LILI: Consort of some cowardly vile toad
who slinks through the night!

DARKNESS: Not so! I requite to shadow's
solace and dark of the night.... Sunshine is my
destroyer!

LILI (scornful): You think you're so powerful....
and hide in the ground like a mole!

DARKNESS (smiling): This too will change. 
The last unicorn dies tonight....!
As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever. 
There shall never be another dawn!

LILI (horrified): No....! You can't....
You mustn't....

Darkness throws back his evil head and LAUGHS.

88 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 
The demonic LAUGHTER of Darkness carries through the massive doors.

JACK: He means to kill the mare, Gump!

GUMP: Don't mourn the corpse
'til the coffin's in the ground.

DARKNESS (OS): My dominion shall encompass
the enternal night!

GUMP: As long as the sun still shines, 
so does hope!

JACK (bitterly: Sun doesn't shine down here.

Jack fingers Lili's silver medallion hanging around his neck
and from out of the blue, inspiration strikes.

JACK (cont) (grinning): Wait a minute....! I 
think I know a way.

89 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Lili stares at Darkness with terror and loathing.

DARKNESS: The world shall be at last as 
nature intended....a place of chaos and
anarchy!

LILI: You're mad!

DARKNESS: Aye, Lady, and proud to be so! 
For in madness lies the soul of all 
that's noble.... Can you fathom the loneliness
of untold eons lived in darkness? My spirit
was forged in that black fire....

LILI: You live alone because you are
loathsome! The contagion of your wicked heart demands
isolation.

DARKNESS: Nay, mistress. I've found
my mate and you know it. We're just 
alike, you and I. Beneath the skin
we are already one.

LILI: Never!

DARKNESS: 'Twas your sin trapped the unicorn.
Even now, the evil seed of what you've 
done blooms within you!

LILI (shrieking): You lie! You're
repulsive!

DARKNESS (stung by her words): No more so than you!
Can't you sense it? That is why I desire you. 
I need someone to share the dark secrets of my 
soul.

LILI: You....? You disgust me! You're
nothing but a beast!

DARKNESS: Everyone is a beast....only most are
afraid to see it!

Darkness compels Lili over to the mirror with the force of his will.

90 LILI'S POV : MIRROR 

Lili sees her reflection in the glass. The lovely feminine
features ALTER into those of a cat-like beast.

DARKNESS (os): This mirror shows how we really are....
Behold your true reflection.

91 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pulls free from his graps and turns from the glass. Her
face remains lovely and unchanged.

LILI (frantic): No! You're working magic on me!
I won't believe it!

DARKNESS: My Lady misjudges me... I am no
common trickster.... look at
you hands!

Lili's fingers transform before her eyes: hooked claws spring from 
their tips, coarse black hair pushes the skin.

DARKNESS (cont) (Laughing): My mirror
never lies.

Lili's lovely face undergoes the same tranmutation she
witnessed in the mirror. She feels fur-covered sheeks and
pointed ears. This time, her SCREAM is hysterical.

Darkness places a protective arm around Lili.

DARKNESS (cont): Glory in your animal nature.
It is your triumph!

LILI: I'm hideous!

DARKNESS: No! The puling, pallid creature you
were was truly something disgusting.
Now you are magificent.... a fierce goddess!

Lili jerks away, HISSING and showing her claws.

LILI: Damn you!

DARKNESS: We are both of us damned, my Queen.

Darkness bows with mock formality, ALTERING into his own shadows, 
which slides through a crack in the paving stones.

Lili cannot resist her reflection. Horrified anew. she falls to the 
floor, WEEPING.

91A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

Round and red, the great disc of the setting sun slides towards the 
distant horizon.

92 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Crazed by anxiety, Jack finds the keyhole and cups his hands around 
it.

JACK (calling out): Lili....? Can you
hear me....?

93 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili huddles WEEPING on the cold stones.

JACK (os): ....Lili....?

At the sound of Jack's voice, the Princess looks up with a start.

LILI: ....Jack?

JACK (os): Over here....
By the door....

Lili turns eagerly turns to the door.

LILI: Oh, Jack....dear Jack! Can it
really be you? I was afraid you 
were dead.

93A INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: Thank God you're all right! I didn't
know what to do.... I never want to
lose you again....

93B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pauses before the keyhole, out of Jack's line of sight.

LILI: Jack, my love....my precious
love! I pray it's you and not more
wicked magic.

93C CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: It's me, you can be sure of that....
and there's magic on our side, too.

93D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

LILI: It's all my fault....the unicorn....
everything....

JACK (os): My fault as much as yours....
Don't worry. We're here to save you.

LILI (sadly): I'm far past saving,
sweet Jack....

A huge tears wells in Lili's eye and flies out toward the keyhole, 
defying gravity.

94 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY

Lili's tear flies through the keyhole and strikes Jack's face like a 
horizontal raindrop. He touches the spot curiously.

GUMP (amazed): How did you do that?

JACK (to Gump): I didn't do anything....
(into keyhole) let me see your face. 
It will give me hope....

Jack strains to see through the keyhole.


95 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili stares at the keyhole in horror.

JACK (os): ....just to glimpse your smile....

LILI (grief-stricken): No.... I can't....
forget me, Jack....

The Princess reaches out her animal's paw and covers the keyhole.

96 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

As the LIGHT in the opening grows DARK, Jack tenderly places his 
hand next to Lili's.

JACK: Lili....? I love you....

Gump pulls frantically on Jack's arm.

GUMP: Come, Jack. We've no time 
to spare.... Remember your plan?

Sadly, Jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows Gump back 
along the corridor.


97 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Princess Lili lies SOBBING. High above, the winged figures watch 
her. The music THROBS, underscoring a low, rhythmic CHANTING. Like 
some ghastly chorus fro, Hell, the living statuary sings in unison 
to Lili:

STATUARY (singing): Bride of Night.... Bride of Night....
Darkness is your heart's delight!
Hail to Darkness! Hail the Night!
His the Power and the Might!
Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom,
Sing his praises from the tomb!

Lili lifts her head, listening to the sepulchral SINGING. Her eyes 
burn like a tiger's. She bares her fangs, and from her throat issues 
a bone-chilling HOWL.

98 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom stop short in their tracks when they hear 
the SOUND of a distant HOWL echoes in the shadows. 

SCREWBALL (trembling): I vote we run like hell! 

The two faeries scamper off into darkness. 
99 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Gump, Jack and a woman-sized Luna wait outside the kitchen door as 
Brown Tom and Screwball come running up. Gump studies his ornate 
timepiece.

GUMP: Where were you? In another three flicks 
of a badger's tail it'll be half-past.

SCREWBALL: Sorry....time slips away
when you're having so much fun.

BROWN TOM (out of breath): We....found the mare
....chained....in the dungeon below.

Gump shoves his timepiece back in his belt.

GUMP: Excellant.... Who has a bit of
parchment?

The two faeries search in their clothing. Screwball produces a 
plethora of trash: marbles, string, old doll's eyes, coloured bird's 
eggs, ancient coins, etc. At last he finds a crumbled peice of 
sheepskin.

SCREWBALL: Here.... I was saving it
to write me will on.

BROWN TOM: Where there's a will there's
a....

GUMP: Shush, both of you....! Jack has a 
plan....a good one....

Gump squats on the floor, and, using a triangle and some charcoal, 
divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles.

GUMP (mumbling): ....angle of refraction equals....
angle of incidence....multiplied by a 
factor of fourty.....divided by the
square root of a google-plex....

Gump SNAPS his fingers triumphantly.

GUMP (cont): Perfect! It will work like a charm, Jack!

JACK: Let's get started! What we need to 
do is sneak back into the kitchen and 
gather all the plates and 
platters....

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! Seen enough
of that kitchen, I have!

BROWN TOM: Don't be so pig-headed! 
You can trust Gump.

SCREWBALL: I'd sooner trust a rat 
in the ghetto!

BROWN TOM: Well.... trust Jack then.

Jack eases open the kitchen door.

JACK: Remember....just the shiny ones....

Jack leads the way back into the kitcheb. Gump urges the other two 
to follow.

GUMP: ....and be quiet! Soft as
thistledown, that's the faerie way.

100 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

Jack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen.

Both Demon Cooks are asleep, the encountered first is stretched out 
across his chopping block, SNORING like a dragon with indisgestion.

The unfortunate Blunder turns slowly over the coals, hog-tied to a 
spit. A bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth. Jack and Gump rush 
to his side.

Gump pulls the apple from Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER (frantic): Get me outta here! Please!
While I'm still medium rare!

GUMP: Quiet....! You're a free imp
on one condition....

BLUNDER(very loud): Condition....! What condition?
Loose me or I'll make such....

Gump shoves the apple back into Blunder's mouth, stoppering his loud 
complaint.

GUMP: Any more noise and you're
shish-ka-bob....

Blunder nods eagerly.

GUMP (cont): You do what we tell you....
understand?

More eager nodding from Blunder.

GUMP (cont): Swear it!

Gump pulls the apple out of Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER: I swear! On the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

Jack cuts Blunder's bonds and the little imp hops nibmly out of the 
fireplace.

BLUNDER: A thousand thanks....

Jack boosts Gump and Screwball up onto the mantle where the polished 
plates are stacked.

JACK: Up we go!

Luna TRANSFORMS into a dot of LIGHT and flies up to the cimnet 
pieces, REMATERIALISING there in her full size.

JACK (cont): Your turn, Blunder.

Jack lifts Blunder onto his shoulds so he can climb to the first 
level of the three-tiered mantle. Blunder joins Screwball, Gump and 
Luna as they rush about the mantlepiece, frantically gathering 
shield-sized plates.

One by one, the faeries toss the plates down to Jack, who stacks 
them in Brown Tom's arms.

Brown Tom staggers through the kitchen carrying a teetering tower of 
plates. He can't see where he is going and trips over the nozzle of 
the giant bellows.

The plates fall with a deafening CRASH!

Both ferocious blind Cooks are awakened by the NOISE.

SECOND COOK: Huh....! Wuzzat?

Jack and the faeries freeze in place as the Cook rises and pulls his 
huge cleaver from the chopping block.

COOK (sniffing the air): Meat....! Me
smells fresh meat!

Jack draws his sword and steps between the awesome Cook and Brown 
Tom, sprawled helplessly on the floor.

SECOND COOK: Find meat!

JACK: Over here!

The blind cook lunges for Jack. He wields his deadly cleaver with 
amazing accuracy for one without sight.

COOK: Chop it up!

Jack ducks past the Cook, smacking him on the leg with the flat of 
his blade. The huge demon YELPS in pain.

The Second Cook picks up a skillet, wielding it like a club.

SECOND COOK: Smash....! Me smash!

Jack is caught between the two demon Cooks. He cannot face one 
without turning his back on the other.

Gump sees Jack's predicament and leaps from the mantle onto the 
Second Cook's head with a wild CRY:

GUMP: Schweinhundt!

Gump clings to the Second Cook like a terrier, confusing him and 
giving Jack time to dart acrobatically out of the way.

JACK (jabbing the Cook): Gotcha!

COOK: Cut you in half!

A mighty swing from the Cook misses Jack, who executes a nimble 
back-flip. The Cook cleaves through a hanging side of meat by 
mistake.

The Second Cook grabs hold of Gump and shakes him.

SECOND COOK: Sweet, sweet blood....

Up on the mantle, Screwball and Blunder exchange a helpless look. 
Gump is a goner unless they do something. They a simultaneous 
unspoken conclusion, and leap onto the Second Cook's back.

SCREWBALL (calling out): Rooster toes....!

BLUNDER (calling out): ....pig whiskers!

Faced with this new twin threat, the Second Cook drops GUmp, who 
immediately bities him on the leg.

SECOND COOK: Whut.....! Who now? Ouch!

Jack fights a rearguard action, stabbing at the savage Cook as he 
retreats.

JACK: Best you can do?

COOK: You gonna be mince-meat!

Jack back onto a steep stone ramp against the far wall.

JACK: Got to catch me first!

The Cook's cleaver CLANGS against the ramp, missing Jack by inches.

The Second Cook has his hands full. Brown Tom has joined the fray 
and clings to his other leg while Blunder and Screwball claw and 
punch at his head.

SCREWBALL & BLUNDER: Hit him....!
Sock him....!

Staggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught, the Second 
Cook lurches in circles.

SECOND COOK: Kill....! Smash....!

Furious, the Second Cook swings his heavy skillet at Screwball and 
Blunder. He misses them completely, hitting himself square on the 
head and knocking himself out.

The faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the 
fireplace.

GUMP: We must help Jack!

The faeries race to the foot of the ramp. Jack parries the Cook's 
fearsome swing. The Cook presses him relentlessly. The CLASH of 
steel rings through the cavernous kitchen.

The faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section.

BLUNDER: Stick him a good one!

SCREWBALL: Cut him down to size, Jack!

Giant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp. The Cook back 
Jack against them. There is no further room for retreat.

COOK: Gonna spill your guts, boy.

The Cook swings his cleaver from the hip. Jack nimbly springs out of 
harm's way. The cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks 
supporting the pyramid of wine barrels.

GRUMBLING, the Cook yanks his cleaver free. This pulls the chock 
loose from under the bottom barrel.

COOK (cont) (Listening): Wuzzat....?

The entire stack of barrels shifts, rolling towards the Cook.

COOK (cont): Bad news!

The Cook runs for his life. The huge hogshead RUMBLE forward in a 
wooden avalanche.

Jack crouches at the top of the ramp. As the Cook runs past he 
sticks the sword-blade between his legs and trips him up.

The Cook tumbles, head over heels, down the ramp.

Half-way up, the faerie band sees the giant barrels ROLLING towards 
them.

SCREWBALL (horrified): Sodom and Glockamora!

The faeries turn and run.

The barrels CRASH on top of the fallen Cook, knocking him senseless 
as they CONTINUE rolling.

The faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen 
doorway at the bottom of the ramp.

The barrels CRUNCH into the kitchen wall. Because they are larger 
than the doorway, the faeries crouching inside are spared.

Oceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave, forcing the door and 
washing the little people into the corridor beyond.

101 INTERIOR KITCHEB CORRIDOR DAY 

Brown Tom is beside himself with delight. He scoops up wine with 
Screwball's helmet and pours it on top of his head..

BROWN TOM: Whoopeeeeeee!

Jack appears in the shattered doorway, sword in hand.

JACK: Hate to break up the
party, but there's work to be
done!

Gump jumps to his feet.

GUMP: Hurry! Get those plates~

Jack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen.

Screwball and Blunder follow, but Brown Tom lingers behind, scooping 
the helmet full of wine.

BROWN TOM: Just a wee taste....

Gump kicks Brown Tom smartly in the pants.

GUMP: Move! Or I make your head ring
worse than any hangover!

Gump chases Brown Tom back into the kitchen.

101A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The faeries gather up the fallen plates. Jack stares thoughtfully at 
the fireplace, where the body of the Second Cook has snuffed out the 
flames.

GUMP: What's on your mind, Jack?

JACK: Smoke rising.... That chimney
must go clear to the top.

Gump peers into the hearth.

GUMP: Not much to hold onto. Take a 
peapod pixie to make the climb.

Screwball steps proudly forward.

SCREWBALL: I'll do it!

The faeries are astonished. Screwball never volunteers.

GUMP: What? Can I believe my ears?

SCREWBALL: Don't see why not. Ain't 
I small enough for the job?

BLUNDER (proudly): No job's too
small for the Buttercup brothers....

SCREWBALL (on his knees: Please, Gump.... let me try.
I know I'm always trouble, but I want
to make it up to you....
Prove that I won't let you down.

BROWN TOM: Be sure ya don't fall down!

GUMP: All right! Do it! But be swift.

SCREWBALL: Thank you....thank you....
You'll never regret it....

Jack boosts Screwball up into the chimney.

JACK: I'm proud of you, Screwball.
(handing him a plate)
Don't drop it....

GUMP (calling up): We'll send Luna with 
a signal when all is ready.

101B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball clings to the smoke-blackened bricks, staring up the 
nearly endless shaft at a small circle of light far above.

BROWN TOM (os) (calling from below): Always
knew you'd be going places, Screwball....
Good luck....!

SCREWBALL (to himself): I'm goin' places,
all right.... straight to the top and on
outta this hell-hole.... No more
kitchen....no more demons.... Just the 
easy life for Screwball Buttercup....

101C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 
A shining gold plate is propper on the Secnd Cook smouldering in the 
fireplace.

Luna positions another plate against the bellows, taking care to get 
the angle right.

Gump stands between the bellows and the shattered kitchen door, 
measuring the nagle with a curious hand-held instrument.

GUMP: Little more to the left, Luna....
that's better..just a touch more....
perfect.

101D INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

Blunder and Brown Tom run off carrying armloads of plates.

Jack leans a platter against the corridor wall, adjsuting it 
precisely.

JACK (calling): How's that, Gump?

GUMP (os): Dead centre....!

102 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili's tears have dried. She prowls the majestic hall with regal 
dignity. Something magic occurs at the baquet table: each crystal 
goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes; every empty 
bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things to 
eat-all of it black!

The food is beautiful in spite on its colour. Lili stares a it with 
undisguised hunger. Some animal instinct warns her not to trust this 
gleaming ebony feast, but she's famished and snatches up an apple 
bright as ploish anthracite.

DARKNESS (os): Good....eat....

Lili GASPS, dropping the apple. Darkness sits in one of the twin 
grostesque thrones flanking the hearth.

DARKNESS (cont): The food is for your enjoyment.

LILI: I don't want it! I'm
not hungry!

DARKNESS: Do you lie just to please me?

LILI: I do nothing for your pleasure!

Darkness gestures to the opposing throne.

DARKNESS: You are so like a child, milady.
Sit, and we'll talk.

Lili makes no move towards the chair. 

DARKNESS (CONT) (gently): Like a 
child, you expect anger and
defiance will upset me.... These
are the qualities I admire most....

Lili snarls, fangs gleaming in the firelight.

LILI: So.... I'd love to rip out your
throat, yet it would pain you more
if I licked your hand....

DARKNESS: All I desire is that you
sit in that chair and talk with me.

Lili approaches the grotesque throne. Like some impossible organism, 
it pulses in anticipation.

LILI: Sit....? Here....?

DARKNESS: Yes. Please....

LILI: I prefer to stand.

For a moment, Darkness nearly sucumbs to anger. The viens in his 
forehead throb. His talons grip his throne in a spam of fury.

DARKNESS (snarling): Sit....!

Darkness shrewdly realises rage won't work and he relaxes with a 
twisted smile.

DARKNESS: (cont): .....or stand. As 
you wish.... It's enough that we're
alone together.... just the two of
us....

102A CLOSE: MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE 

Across the Great Hall from the blazing hearth is an identical 
fireplace. This one is cold, but not empty. Covered with soot and as 
black as a Moor, Screwball climbs into VIEW between the massive 
andirons.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): All of time
awaits us....why not make a start.

Screwball puts down his plate and tiptoes into the Great Hall 
towards the banqueting table.

LILI (os): A start at what....?

102B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness leans forward in his throne, smiling at Lili.

DARKNESS: Simple conversation....

LILI: What do we possibly have to
talk about?

DARKNESS: Thoughts....dreams....
ambitions....

LILI: I have no interest in your
foul ambition.

DARKNESS: Desire then....surely we 
beasts all have desire.

102C INTERIOR GREAT HALL (MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE) DAY

Unseen, Screwball climbs up onto the banquet table. He can't believe 
his good fortune. A bounteous feast surrounds him.

LILI (os): You'd never dream what 
I desire....

DARKNESS (os): Don't be so sure....
Dreams are my speciality

Screwballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit. He rushes about, 
treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by 
such plenty.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): It is through
dreams I influence mankind. I have 
dreams of my own.... dreams of enternity
with you....no more silence....no
more loneliness....

102D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili LAUGHS in the face of Darkness.

LILI (scornfully): Such drivel! You
sound like some simpering schoolboy!

DARKNESS: I'll wager there was a 
time when the attention of a 
devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to
your liking.

Lili regards her claws with a savage sneer.

LILI (snarling): I know what I'd do
with such meat now!

DARKNESS: ....all things change, lady.
The pleasures of youth become the
regrets of maturity....

A loud CRASH on the banquet table causes Darkness to look around. He 
SEES Screwball standing by the centrepiece, about to shove a whole 
chicken in his mouth.

DARKNESS (cont) (angry): What're
you doing here?

Blackened with soot, Screwball easily passes for a goblin.

SCREWBALL (all innocence): .....am
I early....?

DARKNESS: You impudent imp!

SCREWBALL: I thought the invitation
said half-past....

DARKNESS (roaring): GET OUT!

Screwball gets the message. He drops the chicken and hops down off 
the banquet table, running to the opposite fireplace for all he's 
worth.

DARKNESS (cont) (gently to Lili): Sit....
I value your thoughts. Why not share them
with me?

Lili looks at the grotesque throne.

LILI: No more than that....just sit?

DARKNESS (nodding): Sit....

Lili steps up onto the oversized footstool. Inches behind her, the 
monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature, the 
powerful sinews rippling with desire.

LILI (a feline smile): Doesn't
seem such an outrageous request....

The Princess prepares to sit, her luscious, silk-swathed bottom only 
inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne.

DARKNESS: You'll never regret granting
me this favour....

Lili's eyes glitter as she teases him.

LILI: What shall we talk about?

DARKNESS (impatient): Just sit!

The febric of Lili's gown brushes the writihing throne. In another 
second she will be sitting. Unexpectedly, she stands up tall on the 
footstool.

LILI: Such a disagreeable chair....must
be terribly uncomfortable. I think 
I'll stand if you don't mind.

Darkness barely controls his raging anger.

DARKNESS: I prefer you to sit!

LILI: I'd rather stand, thank you.

Darkness's forehead swells with fury.

DARKNESS: Sit!

LILI: No.... Not now....

Darkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy, rising up to tower over 
Lili.

DARKNESS (roaring): I command you to sit!

Lili is utterly unafraid. She LAUGHS at the swollen image of 
Darkness.

LILI: Don't be silly.

Lili hops down from the footstool.

DARKNESS (screaming with rage): SIT, DAMN YOU!

Lili sashays past him, twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton 
fashion. Her hearty LAUGH is as loud as the outraged ROARS of 
Darkness.

LILI (laughing): Never.... never....

110A INTERIOR DUNGEON CHASM DAY 
Jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to Brown 
Tom waiting on the viaduct above.

Jack hurls another plate.

Suddenly, the Winged Monster, hatched from the walking Egg, glides 
SHRIEKING from the shadows. It catches the plate in its saw-toothed 
beak and dives at Jack. Gump sees it first.

GUMP: Jack....!

Dropping the plate, the Winged Monster rips at Jack. The Green Man 
draws his sword and defends himself. The fight is savage and brief. 
Jack hacks the Monster out of the air. It lies, flapping and broken 
at his feet. Gump touches him sympathetically on the arm.

JACK: ....I'm all right....Let's
get on....to the dungeon....

GUMP (pensive): You have power 
within I never imagined. 

111 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Darkness stares at the Princess in a towering rage. She 
flirtatiously pretends to be interested in a bit of fruit before 
rejecting it in favour of another, which also proves not to her 
liking.

DARKNESS: I'm not above my own little
pranks, milady.... Should you have
a taste for them.

LILI: No doubt they're as foul as
the stuff you set on your table....

Darkness relaxes, taking his cue from Lili's mocking tone.

DARKNESS: Foul....or fair, such distinctions
are entirely arbitrary, my dear.... Does
not the lowly toad think his mate fair, 
warts and all....?

LILI: Do you suggest I will think 
you fair some day?

DARKNESS: In time....and time we surely
have... stretching before us....
infinity....like a merciful curtain closing
off the past....

Darkness moves gracefully to Lili's side and kneels before her.

DARKNESS (cont): I beseech you...do not reject
my foods as you do my food.... Never have I
abased myself so before another....It is not
humility that brings me low, mistress.... but
love....

LILI: Love?

DARKNESS: Aye, love.... You think my
heart a barren desert where only
hate can flower....A much finer blossom
show its petals now....nourished by
sorrow....watered with your tears...
(baring his breast)
I offer you this rose, Princess!
....my heart....my soul....

Lili is astonished. She walks away to consider what Darkness
has said.

Darkness watches her slyly. His expression reveals his words
to have been a ruse. He gloats in anticipation.

Lili turns back to face him. Darkness immediately resumes his look 
of adoration.

LILI: You dizzy me, lord.... I never
thought to hear the word 'love' 
spoken again....

DARKNESS: You'll hear it forever.
(shouting)
I love you!

LILI: If such is true....hope 
is yet alive...
(regarding her claws)
These talons can caress as well as kill....

They are interrupted by the SOUND of a CHIME. An unseen clocks tolls 
the hour.

Darkness stares up into the shadows.

DARKNESS: It grows late....

111A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

The setting sun blazes through distant drifting clouds, tinting the 
sky in a riot of colours. Another CHIME is heard.

111B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The SOUND of the unicorn's frightened whinny carries up from the 
dungeons below.

DARKNESS (laughing): Our wedding
feast is in good voice....Think
you not?

Lili cunningly disguises her alarm.

LILI: I admire your thrift, my lord,
both the meal and entertainment
in a single dish.

Darkness appreciates this joke.

DARKNESS: Are you anxious to see blood flow?

LILI: As you are to drink it!
(smiling slyly)
Will the groom grant his bride her wish
on this night?

DARKNESS (beaming with pleasure): 
You have but to ask my savage beauty.

Lili leers, baring her feline teeth.

LILI: I want to kill the unicorn!

Darkness claps his hands with joy.

DARKNESS: Lady, you make me proud....

111C INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball struggles up the endless chimney, past hideous gargoyles 
and ancient skeletons imbedded in the blackened bricks.

The SOUNDS of conversation CARRY UP from below.

LILI (OS): I will do it with joy....!
Let the unicorn's blood anoint our love!

SCREWBALL: Crumpets and candlesticks....!
She's gonna kill it!

LILI (OS): ....and in the eternity
awaiting us, I will happily sit on your throne
as befits the Queen of Darkness!

SCREWBALL: I can't let that happen....Why,
it's not civilized!

Clutching the golden plate, Screwball struggles upwards like
a tiny mountaineer.

He reaches into a grinning skull for a handhold and the jaws
clamp shut on his fingers.

SCREWBALL (cont): Billygoat dumplings!

Screwball yanks his hand free, nearly losing his balance. His terror 
gives him renewed energy and he scrambles frantically up the inside 
of the chimney.

111D EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY 

The chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon. Black as a sweep, 
Screwball emerges at the top and looks around.

The distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of 
dark mountains. We HEAR the SOUND of a clock CHIME!

111E INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

A distant CHIME stops Gump in his tracks. He pulls out his timepiece 
from the pouch and studies it.

GUMP: ....not much time....

111F INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Princess Lili stretches out her arms towards Darkness.

LILI: Bring me to the wretched beast.

Darkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth.

The unicorn's distant whinny ECHOES from below.

DARKNESS: This way, fair beauty. I hear a 
throat begging to be cut.

Lili hesitates when she realises Darkness intends to lead
her straight into the flames.

LILI (fearful): No....! It's impossible!

Darkness steps into the leaping flames. He turns and takes
Lili's hand.

DARKNESS: Now you are my queen. Nothing is
impossible....Come....it takes but a 
single step....Find the faith....

Darkness looks deep into Lili's eyes. She places her tiny
foot among the white glowing coals. Nothing happens. Not
even the fur is singed.

Lili smiles. Her fear vanishes. She stands at the side of her 
master. Darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are 
consumed by flames, becoming one with the blaze around them.

112 DELETED

113 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Unseen by the deformed goblin GUARDS, the faeries creep out of the 
shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column.

Jack positions Blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate 
before joining the others.

JACK: Everything's ready....

GUMP: And you, Jack? Your greatest
challenge is still to come....

Darkness and Princess Lili emerge, arm in arm, out of a background 
curtain of fire. They sweep majestically down the stone steps to 
where the unicorn is chained.

Silent as mice, Jack and the faeries peer around at them. Jack is 
horrified by Lili's bestial appearance. 
JACK: ....oh, God....! Lili....

GUMP: Judge her with your heart, not
your eyes.

Blix and Poxand the other goblin Guards scramble to attention as the 
regal pair ascends.

BLIX: Greetings....

POX: S-s-s-salutations....

DARKNESS: Silence....! Prepare the unicorn 
for sacrafice!

The goblins hurry to comply. Blix selects a grotesque black 
greatsword from among a rack of weapons.

Pox furiously pedals a grindstone. Blix applies the blade. Showers 
of sparks shower onto the glistening floor.

Behind the column, the watching faeries are desparate. Luna's 
glowing LIGHT hovers above their heads.

BROWN TOM: The game is lost....for all
of Jack's pretty plan...
. 
JACK: No! It'll work! It must!

GUMP: Luna! Fly up to Screwball! Tell
him it's time!

Quick as a FLASH, Luna STREAKS off into the shadows.

Blix carries the sharpened greatsword to Darkness, offering it with 
a low bow.

DARKNESS: Excellent.... Let the ritual
begin....

The demon Guards stand in a semi-circle around the unicorn. Blix and 
Pox open tattered black prayer books. Darkness steps to a twisted 
lectern and READS from a sinister volume.

DARKNESS: In the beginning, there was
nothing....a void of darkness, a cold
enternity of silence....

POX: Endless night, black as death!
Mother of Shadows protect us!

The assembled Guards answer in a ghastly CHORUS:

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Mother of Shadows, renew us!

POX: Dream Sister....eclipse our pain!

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Night Bride....restore our strength!

114 INTERIOR KEEP AND CORRIDORS DAY

Luna BLAZES straight up out of the abysmal keep; a tiny shooting 
star. The demons' ceremony continues (OS):

DARKNESS (OS): ....and when the perfect void
was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was
heard and all the brethern fled in terror....

Luna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (OS): Deliver us, O' 
Darkness, from all fear....

115 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness steps forward. His booming VOICE disturbs the sleeping abts 
and sends them wheeling in clouds around his head.

DARKNESS: Hear me, ye Powers of the Night! We
offer this sacrafive in honour of you....

Darkness reaches up and seizes a fluttering bat from out of the air.

DARKNESS (cont): Here is our offering....
sanctified with blood....

Darkness crushes the bat to a pulp and splatters the unicorn's white 
flank with its blood. Darkness struggles mentally with the mare.

DARKNESS (cont): ....and with fire!

Darkness touches his fingertip to the unicorn's haunch. The hide 
smoulders instantly, leaving an ugly brand.

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Blood and fire, born of Night....
Blood and fire, drown the Light!

The unicorn rears back. Her hooves CLATTER on the cold
stones.

DARKNESS: I pray you, Father, accept my 
sacrafice....Let Light be orever extinguished!
Let the Age of Darkness begin!

Darkness contorts with the strain on imposing his will on the 
unicorn. He dominates the mare and she grows calm.

As the Demon Guards CHANT, Blix and Pox strain at the winch. They 
drag the unicorns towards the chopping block.

116A EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY

Screwball stands watching the sunset. One hands holds the plate, the 
other polishes a black apple on his tunic.

SCREWBALL (singing under his breath):
....nickety-nackety....noo-noo-noo....

The apple is bright as obsidian. Screwball smiles at his reflection 
on its gleaming surface.

SCREWBALL (cont) (singing): ....fiddle-
dee-widdle-dee....

Screwball takes a big bite of the apple.

Screwball grins, chewing happily. Not a care in the world.

It hits him like a stroke. His eyes cross and he toppes, dropping 
the plate.

Luna comes BLASTING out of the chimney like a tracer bullet.

LUNA (tiny voice): Screwball!

Screwball falls onto the rim of the chimney.

In a brilliant BURST OF LIGHT, Luna materialises into her grown 
self, catching the plate an instant before it drops over the edge.

LUNA (cont): Do it!

Luna looks sadly down on Screwball, touching him with her toe.

LUNA (cont): Screwball...wake up!

Screwball SNORES loudly.

LUNA (cont): Oh, Screwball....

Luna aims the golden plate at the ruby BLAZE of the setting
sun. She aims a beam of LIGHT straight down the chimney.

116B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY

The beam of LIGHT descends the dark shaft like a golden waterfall. 

116C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The beam of LIGHT moves like a searchlight inside the fireplace, 
criss-crossing the Second Cook's body as it misses the propped plate 
he holds by inches.

117 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Working together, the two goblins turn the iron winch. Bit by bit, 
the cable is drawn forward onto the drum.

The unicorn's neck is stretched across the block.

Darkness stands before Lili, offering the greatsword.

DARKNESS: Once your hands were too delicate
for such a task....spinning and weaving 
were more their work....

LILI: Let my loom be made of flesh and blood....
I am sister to the Fates!

Lili eagerly seizes the sword.

DARKNESS: What a queen you'll make!

Jack slumps against the wall, desparate.

JACK: Come on, Screwball....

GUMP: She means to do it, Jack!
She's one of them!

Jack stares at Lili.

Gump grabs a long black bow from a weapon rack, and an arrow from a 
quiver beside it.

GUMP (cont): I'm going to stop her!

JACK: Gump, wait! I trust her!

Gump fits an arrow onto the bowstring.

The unicorn is helpless before Lili. Blix locks the winch, securing 
the cable.

DARKNESS: My lady, the birth of a new
world awaits your stroke.

Lili swings the greatsword high over head.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (chanting):
Blood and fire....eternal ice!
Blood and fire....and sacrafice....

Gump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili.

JACK: No....! Don't...!

Jack grabs the bow. He and Gump struggle for the weapon.

120B INTERIOR KEEP DAY 

The beam of LIGHT ZOOMS out of the corridor, strikes the plate on 
the viaduct, and REFLECTS down into the lowest depths of the castle.

121 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Gump is determined to shoot Lili. Jack, equally determined to stop 
him.

JACK: I trust her, Gump....I'll
always trust her....

GUMP: Foolish, mortal!

The beam of LIGHT STREAMS in through the corridor. Blunder REFLECTS 
it off his plate towards the others.

Struggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf 
the moment the LIGHT beam reaches it.

BROWN TOM: Stop lads....! The light!

A wild LAUGH bursts from Lili's throat. She swings the sword with 
all her might.

The blade arcs through the air, a glittering SUNBURST where it 
carves through the deflected beam of LIGHT.

Lili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her. The 
sword severs the woven cable.

LILI (exultant): Run! You're free....!

The unicorn plunges into the shadows. Only the ECHO of her hoofbeats 
remain.

Jack and Gump stop struggling. Jack dives for his fallen shield.

Darkness pulls a weapon from his belt. It is the stallion's alicorn 
mounted as a shortsword.

DARKNESS (sneering savagely): Innocence!

Huge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn 
straight through her side.

Lili is pierced by the horn. She GASPS, supported by the Demon's 
hold on the blade.

Miraculously, Lili's features alter and TRANSFORM. The fangs and 
claws disappear. Her fur melts like the morning dew. She is an 
innocent maiden once more.

Lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground.

Jack holds his shield in the beam of LIGHT, angling in a bright 
swath towards Darkness.

JACK: Burn....! You evil bastard....

The LIGHT hits Darkness like an express train. He HOWLS, blasted in 
a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon.

Darkness cowers on his knees, SCREAMING in the LIGHT.

All the goblins scatter HOWLING from the LIGHT. 

Brown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight 
up into the central keep.

BROWN TOM: ....and we'll dance on the 
black devil's grave....

GUMP'S POV : LOOKING UP: The beam of LIGHT dims and goes
out.

BROWN TOM (OS): What's wrong....? What's
happening, Gump?

Gump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield
he holds.

GUMP (sadly): Sunset....

With a savage SNARL, Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing 
trendrils of smoke.

Jack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side. He kneels and 
cradles her in his arms.

Throwing back his head, Jack HOWLS like a wild animal. His CRY is a 
wolf-wail of utter despair.

Gump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man.

GUMP: No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare!

Gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword.

GUMP (cont): The world needs a champion!
(handing Jack the black sword)
Use this against him!

Jack snatches the sword. He rises cold with fury and runs off into 
pursuit of Darkness.

125A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT

The unicorn gallops through a desolate landscape of broken columns 
and grumbled masonry.

126 EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD NIGHT 

A precipice jutting over eternity. The unicorn runs along a narrow 
trail bordering the edge of the abyss, highlighted by a bright 
backdrop of comets and stars.

126A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT 

CLOSE ON: The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along 
the unicorn's track. 

PULL BACK to show Darkness TRANSFORMED into a muscular black unicorn 
stallion. He surges onward, an explosion of strength. FLAMES flare 
from his nostrils.

126B EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD DAY 

The huge black unciron THUNDERS out of the cavern-mouth.

The mare stand alone, trapped on a final promontory.

The black stallion REARS and charges the mare....

Black and terrible, the devil stallion rises over the mare, striking 
out with his fearsome hooves.

The mare staggers before this onslaught of evil, falling to the 
ground amid flying black feet.

The black stallion paws the ground, preparing to ram his alicorn 
into the fallen mare.

Jack runs out from the dark cavern, gripping the evil greatsword 
with both hands. He sees the stallion tower above the mare

JACK (calling out): Darkness....!
You rotten filth!

The superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge. He 
SNORTS, breathing fire, and lowers his head, charging straight at 
Jack.

Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black 
stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking SPARK.

Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn ROARS
slavering past.

The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it 
were striking a ghost.

Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he 
manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes 
again.

The black unicorn's red eyes BLAZE as he crashes into Jack.

The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side. He loses the 
greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground.

Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows.. He sees the black hooves of 
Darkness standing before him.

Looking up, Jack sees the Lord of Darkness TRANSFORMED back to his 
original form. He holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the 
boy's heart.

DARKNESS: Always a pleasure to take a 
brave man's life. 

Darkness thrusts down with the alicorn, but Jack rolls skillfully 
aside and counds to his feet.

JACK: ....haven't killed me yet....

Jack draws his own sword and swings at Darkness, who parries with 
the alicorn. SPARKS fly.

Jack swings again. Darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and 
holds Jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze.

DARKNESS: ....Oh, but I have...

Jack is speechless with horror.

DARKNESS (cont): Don't you know me, boy,
don't you know from whence I come....

The muscle hump behind Darkness's neck bulges and cracks. It bursts 
open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold. Jack's horror is 
complete.

DARKNESS (cont): Time to die....

Darkness drives the alicorn sword into Jack's chest, running him 
through.

Jack's eyes are wide with astonishment. Is this what it's like to 
die?

Darkness pulls the alicorn out of Jack. There is no blood! No trace 
of a wound remains on his flesh. Jack blinks in wordless amazement.

DARKNESS (cont): So...! I should have
known....We're just the same! You're
immortal, Jack!

JACK (disbelieving): No....! I'm not!
I'm human....

DARKNESS (laughing): Who was your mother?

JACK (confused): I....don't know....

DARKNESS: Who was your father?

JACK: ....I....can't remember....

DARKNESS: How long have you lived in 
the forest?

JACK: All my life....! I...I....
know who I am....

DARKNESS: You pitiful fool! An immortal
all this time and never knew....
(laughing)
Don't you see, Jack? Don't you understand
your power....! Together we could rule 
the universe!

JACK (bewildered): .....together....?

DARKNESS: There'd be nothing to stop us!
No power could stand in our way! We're
just the same, Jack....You and I.....
eternal....!

Jack struggles to understand the immensity of this
revelation. He wavers in the face of the demon's persuasiveness.

All at once, the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows, white and 
pure.

She spears Darkness straight his mid-section. The evil Lord SCREAMS, 
staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest.

DARKNESS (cont): ....Father....! Protect me....

Darkness starts to shrink. The mare lifts the writhing demon high in 
the air, impaled like a kicking insect.

Rearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe 
edge into the abyss.

Darkness tumbles into the haze. His final HOWL is a lament from the 
depths of Hell.

At the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness TRANSFORMS into 
the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows.

Jack picks up the alicorn. He wraps his other arm around the 
unicorn's neck. They stand together at the edge of the world, united 
in a victorious embrace.

126C EXTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVERN NIGHT 

The faeries gather at the entrance. Screwball is there, half asleep. 
Luna is full-sized. Pale and sleeping, Lili lies on the black cloak. 
The faeries stand around her, eyes downcast.

Jack rides up, mounted on the unicorn. Surrounded by light, he is 
more than a champion. He is divine. The faeries are delighted.

GUMP: Why....Jack....solved 
your riddle at last....

BROWN TOM: Should've known no 
mortal could speak unicorn 
like that....

JACK: How is Lili?

GUMP: Sadly beyond the help of faerie
magic. She's under a powerful spell....
It's like a riddle....

Jack understands. He brightens into a smile.

JAC: I know the answer....! Lift
her to me, gently....

Jack hands Gump the alicorn as the faeries gather Lili in their 
arms, lifting her above their heads.

Jack carefully pulls the enchanted Princess in front of him across 
the unicorn's withers.

JACK (cont): We'll meet again, dear friends....

Jack touches his heels to the unicorn's flanks and they
gallop off in a CLATTER of hoofbeats.

GUMP (waving): Ride like the wind,
Jack....

BROWN TOM: Wish we could go with him....

GUMP: And why not? I know some magic
words that'll do the trick!

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! I hate to travel
like that....makes me sick.

GUMP: Stand back....! The sky's the 
limit!

SCREWBALL: Can't stand your bumpy
takeoffs....

Abruptly, Screwball SHOOTS into the air, flying out of
sight.

GUMP: Screwball! Wait for the spell....

SCREWBALL (os): ....I never do....

Gump gestures magically.

GUMP: Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff....

All at once, Gump, Blunder, and Brown Tom STREAK off into space. 
Luna watches them go. TRANSFORMING into a dot of LIGHT, she speeds 
up after them.

127 EXTERIOR FOREST (RIDE MONTAGE) NIGHT 

Jack clings to Lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight 
forest, darting like quicksilver between the shadowy trees, leaping 
impossible chasms, splashing across streams in a burst of moonlit 
spray.

127A EXTERIOR SKY NIGHT 

The full moon hangs above like the lantern of God as the faeries 
tumble through the clear night sky. Gump rides the alicorn like a 
broomstick.

Far below, magically white and fluid as free-roving moonbeam, the 
unicorn carries her passengers across the nocturnal forest with the 
ease of a dreamer transported through time.

128 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 
It is not yet sun-up. The first faint trace of the false dawn tints 
the eastern horizon. Everywhere, the snow is melting. It is like 
springtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen 
landscape.

A bright beam of LIGHT APPROACHES, weaving between the giant trees. 
It is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn.

Jack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides 
easily to the ground with Lili in his arms.

The unicorn doesn't move. She stands watching as Jack gently rests 
Lili down on the mossy earth.

Jack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the 
promontory. He dives gracefully into the pond.

128A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY 

Screwball in the lead, the faeries CRASH down through the trees, 
bouncing to a stop on the forest floor.

SCREWBALL: Ow!

BROWN TOM: Ouch!

GUMP (cheerfully): Home again!

The bedraggled faeries scowl at Gump.

129 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack streaks down, streaming air bubbles like a comet's tail.

129A EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

The faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion. His alicorn 
has been restored. Wreathed in flowers, it stands majestically out 
from his forehead.

129B EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack strokes deeper and deeper into the pond, past undulating weeds 
and curious fish.

129C EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Faeries are all about, dancing and SINGING around the statuesque 
unicorn. They pelt one another with petals. The mare stands demurely 
to one side, draped in blossoms.

129D EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

At the bottom, Jack moves carefully, trying not to stir up the muck. 
He gently parts the drifting trendrils, searching among the water 
weeds.

129E EXTERIOR TREETOP DAY 

High above the faerie celebration, beautiful MUSIC is HEARD. It is 
Gump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine. 
Delicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly 
into the heavens. It is just dawn. The sun's GLOW blazes in the 
east.

129F EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

A winking GLEAM catches Jack's eyes and he reaches out an eager 
hand.

A cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers. Centred 
on his palm, golden and perfect, is Lili's ring.

129G EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Round and full, the sun rises. The golden sun rays pierce through 
the trees and start across the open meadow. Gump's music continues, 
more lyrical than ever.

As the sunlight advances, bright spring flowers push up through the 
once-frozen earth.

129H EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack turns and strokes upwards, higher and higher, towards the 
shining ceiling of light far above.

129I EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Gump's music swells to a crescendo. The life-giving sunlight reaches 
across the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion.

130 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 

Jack breaks the surface, holding the ring triumphantly above his 
head.

130A EXTERIOR CLIFF ABOVE POND DAY 

The Princess sleeps under the tree. She no longer wears the black 
wedding gown, but is dressed as before. Jack's armour has also 
disappeared.

Jack kneels before Lili and slips the ring onto her finger.

He takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the 
mouth.

Lili smiles. Her eyelids flutter.

LILI: Oh....! Jack! What a dream

LILI (cont): Such a terrible dream....
I could never tell you....

Lili looks around, but Jack is nowhere in sight.

LILI (cont): Jack....? Where are you....?
(calling)
Green Jack!

Getting no reply, Lili wanders off in search of Jack.

137 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

Puzzled, Lili searches the familiar place.

LILI (calling): Jack....! Where are you
hiding now?

The wind surges through the treetops. The leaves all move together 
as if they were a single living organism.

Jack's VOICE is heard out of the waving trees.

JACK (os): I'm everywhere, Lili....my
spirit lives in everything....

LILI: Jack.... Don't play games with me!
I love you!

JACK (os): I....love.....you...

LILI: Will you be here tomorrow?

Unseen in the bushes, Gump and the faeries hide, grinning as
they watch Lili.

JACK (os): I'm always here, Lili....
whenever you come....

Mystified, but happy, Princess Lili picks a flower and wanders off 
into the sun-bright woods.

END CREDITS ROLL

138 EXTERIOR MEADOW DAY 

A lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers. Breasting 
the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds 
joyfully in total freedom.

Mounted on the animal's back, his arms in victory, Jack rides like a 
triumphant angel. His hair and skin are tinted green! He is the 
incarnation of all that is magical in Nature.

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
          Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.
          A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The
          unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                      When I was a little girl, my mother
                      would remind me each night before
                      bed to be sure to open my heart to
                      God, for he was kind, merciful and
                      just. Things changed after my
                      father left a few years later,
                      leaving her to raise me and my
                      brothers alone in a little place
                      out on the edge of the Mojave
                      Desert. She never talked about a
                      kind and merciful God again.
                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
                      Of a time when all the world would
                      be covered in darkness and the fate
                      of Mankind would be decided. One
                      night I finally got up the courage
                      to ask my mother why God had
                      changed, why was he mad at his
                      children. "I don't know," she
                      said, tucking the covers around me,
                      "I guess he just got tired of all
                      the bullshit."
          And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
          OUT, leaving us in:

          DARKNESS...
          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS

          A BLOOD RED MOON
          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

          TWO BLACK BOOTS
          land hard in the water...and we're in:

          

                                                                      2.

          

          

          

          EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

          A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
          fight.
          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
          to motivate him.
          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
          past.
          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
          sharp.
          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
          and then...

          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO

          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.

          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...

          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...

          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...

          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,

          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...

          

                                                                     3.

          

          

          

          EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
          across the street.

          "GUN & SPORT WORLD"

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the
          sound of RAIN, then...
          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
          shower of glass.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
          a living book. But the writing is in no language we
          recognize.
          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.

          FRESH. BLOODY.
          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
          cement floor around his feet.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

          Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
          for this.
          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get
          out of here?

          

                                                                         4.

          

          

          

          INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

          Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.
          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
          streetwalkers.

                              BURTON
                    Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
                    I wish I could take a match to this
                    city just so I could watch all
                    these motherfuckers burn.

                              ESTEVEZ

                        (LAUGHS)
                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
          Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

                              BURTON
                    A fresh start. That's what this
                    place needs.
          He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
          they pass, picking them off one by one.

                                  BURTON
                    Pow!   Pow!     Pow!
          Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his
          partner, wary.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
                    happy we get to share beautiful
                    moments like this. They really
                    brighten my da--
          KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
          to see...

          

          EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS

          Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
          out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.

          

                                                                      5.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
                    Freeze!
          Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
          crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
          In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
          CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
          "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
          The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.

                              MICHAEL
                        (sensing their unease:)
                    It's starting. There isn't much
                    time.
          The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
          the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.

                              BURTON
                    Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
                    now!
          Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Hands on your head!    On your head!
          Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.

                              BURTON
                    Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
          Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.
          Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
          FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
          decision made.
          And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
          In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
          helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
          Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
          with Burton.
          Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.

                              BURTON
                    Let `em go!

          

                                                                     6.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Take the shot, Burton!

                              BURTON
                    I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
          Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
          throat like a skipping record.

                               ESTEVEZ
                    Burton!?
          THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
          confusion.
          Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
          QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
          pressure were building inside him.
          And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH

          BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE

          CLOWN!
          His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
          in control.
          Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
          GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.

                              BURTON
                    What are you doing, Michael?   These
                    weren't your orders.
          Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    What did you say?
          Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm following my own orders now.

                              BURTON
                    Then you will die along with the
                    child.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
          BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
          leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
          faster, already FIRING back.
          Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window
          SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!

          

                                                                    7.

          

          
          And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
          Smoke rising from his gun.
          With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
          and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
          He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
          FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
          wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

          

          JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
          Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat.

          

          INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

          Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
          bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
          shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.

          

          EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN

          A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
          eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
          trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
          decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
          trailers roof lines, marking the season.
          One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
          out into the cool western morning. Home.
          Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
          two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
          Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
          Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
          glows like a beacon in the darkness:

          "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
          A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.

                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    You okay, Jeep?
          Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
          twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
          from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
          strikingly beautiful.

          

                                                                8.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    Sorry to wake you, Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                        (stepping out of the
                         trailer, hands on her

                         BELLY)
                    Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a
                    storm all night. Must know
                    somethin' I don't.
          She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes.

                              CHARLIE
                    Another bad dream?
          He struggles for a moment, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.
                    You do too much worryin'. About
                    this place. About your dad.

                        (BEAT)
                    About me...
          A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.

                              JEEP
                    You're the only thing I like
                    worrying about.

                              CHARLIE
                    See what I mean? You're worried
                    about a girl eight months pregnant
                    and it isn't even your baby. Now
                    that's enough to give anybody
                    nightmares.
          Jeep turns away, dejected.

                              JEEP
                    Go ahead, make fun of me.
                    Everybody else does.

                              CHARLIE
                        (turns him back around)
                    C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You
                    know how much I appreciate
                    everything you and Bob are doing
                    for me, but a month from now, this
                    baby'll have a new family and I'll
                    have to start thinkin' about what
                    the hell I'm doin' with my life.
          This is not news Jeep wants to hear.

          

                                                                      9.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    So you're still going through with
                    it...?

                              CHARLIE
                    Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.
                    Christ, I can barely take care of
                    myself as it is.

                              JEEP
                    I could help you. We could do it
                    together, you know? I want to.
          Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
          this just isn't where she's at.

                              CHARLIE
                    You gotta stop carryin' the weight
                    of the world on your shoulders.
          Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.

                              CHARLIE
                        (rubbing her arms)
                    Now can we go back in? I'm
                    freezing my ass off out here.

                               JEEP
                    Go on.   I'll be right there.
          Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
          trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the
          clank of the door, she's gone.
          And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
          FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.

                              JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)
                    I don't know whether I like it very
                    much being seen around with an
                    angel without any wings.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV
          Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his
          guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
          and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to
          momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.

                              CLARENCE (ON TV)
                    Oh, I've got to earn them and
                    you'll help me, won't you?

          

                                                                  10.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
          roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
          the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
          The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
          you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
          the Shopping Network.
          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
          drinker.
          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The
          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

                              PERCY
                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
                    these days that thing's gonna hit
                    you back.

          WHACK!

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
                    got a special relationship here.

          WHACK!

                              PERCY
                    Yeah, they got names for that kind
                    a relationship.
          The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
          MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
          A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
          and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
          jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
          as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
          really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
          billboard of rebellion.

                              SANDRA (O.S.)
                    It's disgusting.

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    You're right. It is disgusting.
          Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
          diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
          and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.

                              SANDRA
                    Really, how can she go out in
                    public wearing that?

                              HOWARD
                    I don't know. Why don't we just
                    ask her?

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
                    me.

                              HOWARD
                        (shouting across the

                         DINER)
                    Audrey, honey? Your mother was
                    wondering if you got dressed this
                    morning with the specific intention
                    of showing your ass off to the
                    entire world?
          The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
          with a caustic smile.

                               AUDREY
                    Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
                    to get double teamed by a couple of
                    meth head truckers in the bathroom
                    of some desert shithole.

                        (BEAT)
                    Good thing we stopped here.
          And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
          the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
          Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.

                              HOWARD
                    I feel satisfied with that answer.
                    I really do.
          Sandra buries her face in her hands.

                              SANDRA
                    I'm being punished for something, I
                    know it.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          
          Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the
          music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT
          The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
          this barren country.
          A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder
          from within.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS
          (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
          boy.
          He passes a weathered road sign:

          "ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
          Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
          He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.

                              KYLE
                    Shit...
          He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
          lonely row of old gas pumps.
          Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
          the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
          Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
          rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
          SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
          The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
          parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
          Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
          flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
          Which way is north?

          

                                                                   13.

          

          

                               KYLE
                    Darren, your fuckin' directions
                    suck, man.
          He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
          out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
          search of a pay phone.
          The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that
          it's been broken for ten years.
          Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
          a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
          very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
          is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
          tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".

                              KYLE
                    Hey...
          She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.

                              KYLE
                    You know that shit right there
                    ain't good for the baby.
          She lets out a long slow exhale.

                              CHARLIE
                    Guess I should think `bout quittin'
                    then.

                              KYLE
                    Now hold on, girl, let me bum one
                    before you do.

                              CHARLIE
                    You can buy a whole pack inside.

                              KYLE
                    Tell ya what. You let me have one
                    of yours, and I'll give you two
                    from the new pack you're gonna sell
                    me.
          She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
          Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
          takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

                              KYLE
                    Am I in the right place?

                              CHARLIE
                        (peers at the map)
                    Only if nowhere's right, `cause
                    that's where you are.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Sonuvabitch. There another phone
                    around here? You know, one that
                    works?

                              CHARLIE
                    Bob'll probably let you use the
                    diner phone if you ask him real
                    nice...And pay `im somethin'.

                              KYLE
                    I can handle that.   You got
                    pancakes here?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for
                    three seventy-five. We also got
                    french toast for four dollars if
                    you're into that. I personally
                    like the pancakes though.

                              JEEP (O.S.)
                    You okay, Charlie?
          They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
          mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie
          quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
                    lost.
          Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
          shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
          back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

                              KYLE
                    Three seventy-five, huh?

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          The DOOR JINGLES.   Charlie and Kyle enter.
          Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
          well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
          appeal she has in his direction.
          Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
          Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
          nightmare.
          Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
          smokes from underneath the counter.

          

                                                                 15.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    I hope Salem Lights are okay,
                    `cause that's all we got left.

                              KYLE
                    If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Where ya been, Charlie?
          Bob steps off the chair.

                              BOB
                    This ain't a resort you know.    I
                    got orders stacking up here.
          In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
          certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.

                              BOB
                        (sees the two cigarettes
                         Kyle's handing her)
                    You best not be smokin' again.    Not
                    in your condition.

                              CHARLIE
                        (gestures to the diner)
                    Bob, do you see where am I right
                    now? Can my condition really get
                    any worse? `Sides, you ain't one
                    to talk.

                               BOB
                    What?   I quit two years ago.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, so why you still carryin'
                    that fancy lighter `round for?

                              BOB
                    It was a gift from my ex-wife,
                    alright? I'm sentimental. I don't
                    wanna forget how much I hate her
                    guts.

                               KYLE
                    Hey man?
          Bob turns to Kyle.   Doesn't like what he sees.

                              KYLE
                    Can I use your phone? My cell
                    doesn't get a signal out here and
                    the pay phone outside is busted.
          Bob is about to respond when:

          

                                                                  16.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    Excuse me...?
          Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's
          interrupting.

                               HOWARD
                    Any news about when our truck might
                    be fixed? You said your boy would
                    have us on the road two hours ago.
                    The rate we're going, we'll be
                    lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
                    Christmas.
          Bob's expression darkens at this news.

                              BOB
                    Goddamn it. Where the hell is
                    Jeep?

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD
          A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of
          an ANGEL carved into the surface.

          

          INT. MECHANIC'S BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
          workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as
          if fear itself were driving him.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Hey, Leonardo...!
          Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
          see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down
          Uhual.

                              BOB
                    The fact that this truck's hood's
                    up mean anything to you?
          Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore
          uncomfortable.

                              JEEP
                    Yeah...

                              BOB
                        (approaches, peering past
                         him to the crib)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                 17.

          
                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Whaddya workin' on that's so
                    goddamn important you're not doin'
                    your job?

                                 JEEP
                    Nothin'...
          Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
          Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.

                              JEEP
                    Found it under a bunch of stuff in
                    the storage shed. I know you never
                    like to throw anything away...
          Bob considers him, softens.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya doin'?

                                 JEEP
                    What...?

                              BOB
                    Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I
                    think it's real good of you to lend
                    her a helping hand, but she is not
                    your responsibility.

                              JEEP
                        (heard this before, pushes
                         past him)
                    Oh whatever, leave me alone.

                              BOB
                    Don't walk away from me while I'm
                    talkin' to you!

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right
          alongside him, not giving up.

                              BOB
                    How long you gonna follow her
                    around like a puppy dog? Cleanin'
                    up the messes she makes while she
                    steps out with every guy around
                    here other than you?!
          Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father:

                              JEEP
                    Don't say that about her!     She's
                    not like that!

          

                                                          18.

          

          
          Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is.

                              BOB
                    You really think she's gonna stick
                    around here after that baby's born
                    and off her hands?
          Jeeps shakes his head, burns.

                              JEEP
                    Look, I know it doesn't make any
                    sense to you, but it's just
                    something I have to do.
          Bob sighs, feels for his boy.

                               BOB
                        (points up at the PARADISE
                          FALLS sign)
                    See that up there? Your mother
                    thought I was crazy for wanting to
                    buy this place, middle of
                    nowhere...But I just knew this was
                    what I was supposed to do. Told
                    your mom, "just wait." Told her
                    when they finally ran the freeway
                    through here like they were
                    plannin' on, this place would be
                    like Grand Central Station.

                        (BEAT)
                    But I was wrong. The freeway never
                    came and now the only people who
                    ever stop here are the ones who are
                    lost.

                        (BEAT)
                    And your mom? Well she got tired
                    of waitin'.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon Dad. You can't blame
                    yourself for what she did--

                               BOB
                    Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're
                    about to make the same damn mistake
                    I made, believing in something
                    that's never gonna happen...Or
                    someone.

                        (BEAT)
                    It's time for you to move on from
                    this place, Jeep. I don't wanna
                    see you wake up one morning old and
                    pissed off, realizing you're lost
                    just like everybody else who stops
                    here.

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A
          tough pill to swallow.

                              BOB
                    Now get to work on that truck. I
                    wanna have these people on the road
                    by nightfall.
          Bob walks back into the diner.
          Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
          something off in the distance.
          Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
          living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.
          Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
          distant mountains. A storm is coming.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter,
          digging into a plate of banana pancakes.
          Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
          steals Bob's attention.

                               BOB
                        (holding up a silencing

                         HAND)
                    Yeah, wait a minute.
          The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is
          mostly snow.
          Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV.

                              BOB
                    What's wrong with you today?

          WHACK!
          The image flickers but doesn't improve.

                              PERCY
                    I told you to get the satellite TV.
                    But you don't wanna listen.

                              BOB
                    What the hell do I need that crap
                    for?

                              PERCY
                    History Channel, man!

          

                                                                    20.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I got all the history I can take.

                              CHARLIE
                    That's for sure.

                              BOB
                    What's your problem now?

          WHACK!

                              CHARLIE
                    Where do I start?

                              BOB
                    You know this was the top-of-the-
                    line model when I bought it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, in the Fifties.

                              BOB
                    You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.
                        (rubs his hands together)
                    Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
          Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!
          And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture
          he was expecting.
          The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
          its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.
          Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

                               BOB
                    See?   Clear as day.

                              PERCY
                    Nice work, Bob. What the hell's
                    that?

                              BOB
                    It's just one of those test things.
          That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
          screen, which read:

          "THIS IS NOT A TEST"
          Bob switches the channels.    All the same.

                              CHARLIE
                    Don't look like a test.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
          if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into
          Kyle.

                               KYLE
                     Yo, am I the Invisible
                     motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you
                     have a phone or not?
          Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
          That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his
          hand.

                               BOB
                     In the back past the kitchen.   Make
                     it fast.
          Kyle hustles passed Percy.
          Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
          Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.

                               SANDRA
                     If there's a real emergency aren't
                     they supposed to give us some
                     information about what to do?

                               HOWARD
                     I'm sure it's a mistake.

                               BOB
                     Hey, Percy, give that old radio of
                     yours a shot. Maybe they got some
                     news about the TV.
          Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.
          Switches it on.
          STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.
          The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station
          after station the same thing.
          The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
          TONES. Everyone goes very still.

                               KYLE (V.O.)
                     Let me talk to him...

          

          INT. DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back
          office, phone to his ear.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                               KYLE (CONT'D)
                        (on phone)
                    Cuz a father should be able to talk
                    to his son, that's why. Now put
                    `im on the phone.
                        (a beat then a smile)
                    Is that my little man...? Yeah,
                    well I'm working hard, so that I
                    can be with you. You bein' good?
                        (strange STATIC can be

                          HEARD)
                    Wait... You're breakin' up.
                    Hello...?
                        (hangs up in frustration)
                    Shit!
          Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
          Frowns. No dial tone.

                              KYLE
                    What the hell...
          He keeps trying.    Nothing.

                              HOWARD (V.O.)
                    Maybe there was an earthquake?

          

          INT. DINER - SAME

          Everyone is looking at Howard.

                               HOWARD
                    They keep sayin' we're overdue for
                    a big one.

                              PERCY
                    Lot a folks could be hurt.

                              BOB
                    Not if it was centered in the
                    desert.

                                HOWARD
                    Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry
                    about.

                              SANDRA
                    So then why's the TV out?

                              HOWARD
                    Maybe it just hit the relay
                    stations. Aren't those usually in
                    remote areas?

          

                                                            23.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Yeah, `cause of the radiation they
                    give off.

                              PERCY
                    There ain't no radiation comin'
                    from those things. Plus that don't
                    explain the radio being out too.
                    Some of those stations broadcast
                    over hundreds of miles. Any quake
                    that big and we would a felt it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Percy's right. I didn't feel
                    nothing.

                              AUDREY
                    Maybe it's a terrorist attack or
                    something...?

                              SANDRA
                        (covers her mouth)
                    Oh god...
          Everyone considers that grimly, then:

                              BOB
                    Well, for cryin' out loud. There's
                    no use in speculating. I'll just
                    call my brother up in Needles. He
                    must a heard something.

                              KYLE (O.S.)
                    I don't think so.
          Kyle has reappeared in the diner.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about?

                              KYLE
                    Phone's dead. Just tried to make a
                    call.

                              BOB
                    You're shittin' me.
          Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.

                              SANDRA
                    Oh, this is just great.

                              BOB
                    Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to
                    get excited about. Probably just
                    working on the lines.

                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your
                    truck fixed up quick as can be, and
                    then you'll be on your way.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something
          with a socket wrench. It's not going well.

                               JEEP
                    Damn it!
          He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The
          sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
          He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
          the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
          how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
          windshield.
          After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
          ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
          frame and wheels of a walker.
          The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
          the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
          with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
          her disappear inside.
          He then looks toward the horizon again.   The WALL OF DARK
          CLOUDS are growing ever closer.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if
          feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.

                              CHARLIE
                    Have a seat wherever you want,
                    Ma'am. Specials are on the board.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Thank you, dear.
          The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.
          She smiles at them pleasantly.
          Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Oh, I already know what I want.

                              CHARLIE
                    Okay, what'll it be?

          

                                                                    25.

          

          

                              OLD WOMAN
                    I'll have the steak, please.

                              CHARLIE
                    And how'd you like that cooked?

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Rare if you would. And water, no
                    ice.

                              CHARLIE
                    Coming right up.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Charlie, is it?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    What an unusual name for a girl.

                              CHARLIE
                    So they say. I'll be right back
                    with your water.
          The old lady turns to the Andersons.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.

                              SANDRA
                    Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm
                    Sandra and this is my husband
                    Howard.

                              GLADYS
                    What a nice young couple you are.
                    What brings you out to these parts?

                              SANDRA
                    We're moving out to Scottsdale.
                    But our truck broke down, and so
                    we're stuck here while it's being
                    fixed.

                              GLADYS
                    Oh, what a nuisance.
          A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.    She doesn't seem
          to notice it.

                              SANDRA
                    Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are
                    down around here. The phone and
                    TV, you know?

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  26.

          
                              SANDRA (cont'd)
                    And I just was wondering if you
                    might have heard something on your
                    way up? You know, about what's
                    going on?
          Gladys smiles strangely.

                               GLADYS
                    Oh, don't worry yourself about
                    that, sweetheart. It'll all be
                    over soon.
          Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that
          response.
          The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S
          FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
          least.
          Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy.
          The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a
          quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one
          eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
          Andersons. Something about her...

                              JEEP
                    The carburetor's shot.    Don't know
                    why. Looks brand new.

                              BOB
                        (glances over at the

                         ANDERSONS)
                    Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.

                              JEEP
                    I could try to rebuild it, but it'd
                    take a while, and I don't think we
                    have all the parts. If we call
                    right now, we might be able to get
                    a new one down here tomorrow
                    morning.

                              BOB
                    That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn
                    phone's out.

                              JEEP
                    What?
          Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
          of Gladys.

                              GLADYS
                    Thank you, dear. How far along are
                    you?

          

                                                                    27.

          

          
          Charlie rests a hand on her belly.

                              CHARLIE
                    Just about there.

                              GLADYS
                    The father must be very proud.

                              CHARLIE
                    I wouldn't know.

                              GLADYS
                    You mean he's...

                              CHARLIE
                    Out of sight. Out of mind.

                                 GLADYS
                    Oh, I see.     So you're not married,
                    I take it?
          A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
          away. But another one lands in its place.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Nope.
          Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
          ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More
          FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
          Charlie is still trying to wave them away.

                              GLADYS
                    That's too bad.

                              CHARLIE
                    No, I prefer it that way. I don't
                    a need a man tellin' me what to do.

                              GLADYS
                    But what about the baby?

                              CHARLIE
                    I've got it under control.

                              GLADYS
                    Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
          Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle
          glances over from the counter.

                              CHARLIE
                    What did you just say?

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              GLADYS
                        (all smiles)
                    I said your fucking baby's gonna
                    burn.
          Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.

                              CHARLIE
                    Go to hell, lady.
          She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
          the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.

                              BOB
                    What happened?

                              CHARLIE
                    Total fucking Jesus freak.
          Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
          her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
          swarming now. How did so many get in here?
          Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
          events.

                              GLADYS
                    All those babies.    They're gonna
                    burn.

                              SANDRA
                    Gladys, please. There's no reason
                    to --
          Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.

                              GLADYS
                    Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!
                    All you do is complain! Complain!
                    Complain!
          Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is
          now focused on the old lady.
          Howard gets up from the booth.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to
                    her!
          But Howard's already standing over Gladys.

                              HOWARD
                    Who the hell do you think you are,
                    lady?! Now, I'd like you to
                    apologize to my --

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

          GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS

          NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

          RAZOR SHARP TEETH.
          EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
          Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood
          covers her face and chest.

                              GLADYS
                    You're all going to fucking die!
          Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he
          whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
          sideways. THWACK!
          BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is
          still standing.
          She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
          DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.
          Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.

                              BOB
                    Don't move!
          But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

          WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!
          Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
          as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

          UPSIDE DOWN!
          BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
          track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
          the ceiling, a rain of plaster.
          Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

                               BOB
                        (struggles to cock the

                          GUN)
                    Fuck!
          Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE

          ROOM!
          The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
          snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
          him.

                              PERCY
                    Shoot her, Jeep!
          Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.

          

                                                                       30.

          

          

                               GLADYS
                         (a sickly sweet smile)
                     You'll never save her.
          Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
          paralyzing him where he stands.

                               PERCY

                     SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
          Gladys rockets straight at him!
          But Jeep's too afraid to move.    He clamps his eyes shut,
          bracing himself for the end.

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an
          animal.
          Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked.
          Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
          He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
          silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
          shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
          such serious heat.

                               SANDRA (O.S.)
                     Somebody help me!
          Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely
          from his neck.
          Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
          then he rushes to help.

                               KYLE
                     Press your hands over the hole!
          Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
          hand.

                               KYLE
                     Don't look at me like that, lady!
                     I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!
                     Now put your goddamn hands over the
                     hole before your husband bleeds to
                     death!
          Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
          desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
          between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
          kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.

          

                                                                    31.

          

          
          A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to
          his feet.

                               BOB
                    The fuck was that?!   What the fuck
                    was that!?
          Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her
          knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult
          facade giving way to that of a frightened child
          A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and
          see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An
          ungodly horror.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his
          neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping
          his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun.
          Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition.
          The engine ROARS to life.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade fishtails onto the highway.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed.

                              KYLE
                    How far to the hospital?

                              PERCY
                    Seventy, maybe eighty miles.
          Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor
          time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.

                              AUDREY
                    What's that on the road?
          Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally
          closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.

                               KYLE
                     They're fuckin' clouds!   What the
                     fuck do they look like?

                               AUDREY
                     Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.
          She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!

          PING!   PING!   PING!
          Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --

          SPLAT!
          And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds.

          THEY'RE FLIES!
          The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by
          insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED
          bug guts. Driving blind!
          The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!
          Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them...

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME

          Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of
          light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like
          he's about to puke or faint.

                                BOB
                     I don't understand how she was
                     still standin' after Percy hit `er
                     with that goddamn fryin' pan.
                     Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it.
                     I swear I did.

                         (BEAT)
                     And did you see that kid's gun?
                     The hell's he doin' with a gun like
                     that?
          Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.

                               BOB
                     It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay.
          But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside.

                               JEEP
                     I couldn't pull the trigger. I
                     froze. I saw what I needed to do,
                     but I was afraid...
                         (breaks down)
                     She could've killed you!

                              JEEP (cont'd)
                    Or Charlie...She would've killed me
                    if it wasn't for...
          He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's
          shoulder.

                               BOB
                    There's nothin' to be ashamed of,
                    Jeep.

                        (BEAT)
                    Not everybody can play the hero.
          Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front

          DOOR JINGLE.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and
          Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,
          gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.
          Percy races for the back.

                              BOB
                        (catching Percy by the

                         ARM)
                    Where you going?!

                              PERCY
                    To get my bible!

                              BOB
                    The hell you need that for?!

                               PERCY
                    Well somebody's gotta start
                    prayin'...
          Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.
          Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the

          SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK

          STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.
          Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the
          day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.
          Apocalyptic.
          No one breathes.

                                                              CUT TO:

          A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN
          Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to
          the bone.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding
          her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey
          watches from a distance with grim fascination.

                              PERCY
                        (raises a bottle of

                         ALCOHOL)
                    Okay, hold `em steady.

                              CHARLIE

                         HERSELF)
                    Oh god, please don't throw up.
          Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
          Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
          Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
          tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
          stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
          just in case.
          Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
          from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
          Percy's frying pan.

                              BOB
                    She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.
                    If I hadn't just seen her walk in
                    here, I'd say the old bag's been
                    dead for hours.
          Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
          mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.

                              KYLE
                    Well, I don't care how long she's
                    been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'
                    in here with us.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the
          plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily
          eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.

          

                                                                       35.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I don't get it.    Why don't they
                    come closer?

                              KYLE
                    How the fuck am I supposed to know,
                    man? You askin' me to explain the
                    behavior of a motherfuckin'
                    pestilence.
          A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
          to the ground.

                              JEEP
                        (holding up the keys)
                    You guys!

          

          GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME
          Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
          AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer
          inside the car.

                              BOB
                    You see anything?

                              KYLE
                    No Twilight Zone shit if that's
                    what you mean.
          Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it.

                              BOB
                    Careful. Old lady could have some
                    kind of rabid poodle locked up in
                    there.
          Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
          hits them.

                               KYLE
                    Agh!   What the fuck is that?
          Bob covers his nose.

                                 BOB
                    Jesus.
          Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But
          nothing unusual.

                              KYLE
                    Nothin' here.

                              JEEP
                    How `bout the trunk?
          They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key
          in.
          The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING.

          MAGGOT INFESTED.
          Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling
          with disgust.
          Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.

                              KYLE
                    Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats
                    in her hoopty! What the fuck is
                    wrong with white people?!

                              BOB
                    Least now we know where that smell
                    was coming from.

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'
                    necessity we figured that out, man.

                               JEEP
                        (sees something up the

                         ROAD)
                    Hey...
          They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
          A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
          stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
          clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
          splattered windows.

                              BOB
                    Okay, now we're talkin'.

                              JEEP
                    Wait a minute. Check it out. It's
                    LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way
                    out here?
          Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.

                              KYLE
                    I'm from Nevada, man.
          They consider the police car a moment more. See the
          SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.

          

                                                                    37.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Give me the shotgun.
          Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.

          Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.

                              CHARLIE
                    Oh, thank God, the police!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
          diner.
          The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face
          goes slack.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, wait!
          The men begin to run toward her...
          While out of the police car steps...

          MICHAEL
          Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
          piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
          as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
          In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
          front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.

                              BOB
                    Take one step closer and I'll drop
                    you right here.
          A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.

                               MICHAEL
                    That how you greet all your
                    customers?

                              BOB
                    Mister, after what we've been
                    through here today, you're lucky we
                    didn't shoot you first and greet
                    you later. Now let me see your
                    teeth.
          Michael stares at him blankly.

          

                                                                       38.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see
                    `em!
          Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
          kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
          ease slightly.

                              JEEP
                    No, shark teeth, Pop.
          Bob lowers the gun.

                               BOB
                    Okay... Suppose you tell us your
                    name then.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Michael.

                              BOB
                    Sorry about all that, Michael.
                    This old lady just went crazy
                    inside my place here. She had
                    these teeth. Never seen anything
                    like `em. Practically bit a man in
                    half.
          Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
          by what he's heard.

                              BOB
                    So what are you doin' out here?
                    Gotta say you don't exactly look
                    like a police officer. Even one
                    from L.A. Then again, you have to
                    be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
                    be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
          Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
          kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
          shotgun again.
          Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
          the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
          table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

                              MICHAEL
                    You don't know, do you?

                                 KYLE
                    Know what?

          

                                                                     39.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    We don't know anything. Nothing's
                    working here. The TV, the radio,
                    the phone...
          Michael just shakes his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm running out of time.
          Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
          blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.

                               BOB
                    Back off, fella...

                        (BEAT)
                    Now, I don't care if this is the
                    second coming of Jesus fucking
                    Christ, I say it's time for you to
                    either get talkin' or get the hell
                    outta here!
          In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
          hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
          himself holding air.
          He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
          pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

                               KYLE
                    Easy!   Easy!
          Michael's expression is totally calm.   Merciless.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.
                    Tell `em you were only kidding!
          But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his
          eyes closed.

                              CHARLIE
                    Let `em go!
          Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
          Considering her.
          The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
          and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
          and Audrey.
          Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

          

                                                                   40.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna
                    go spillin' blood for no good
                    reason in front of all these decent
                    people, do ya? Our friend Bob here
                    ain't worth the trouble it'd cause
                    ya.

                        (BEAT)
                    So whaddya say `bout just lettin'
                    `im go and then you can be on your
                    way? Nice `n' easy.
          But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea.   It's not
          looking good.
          No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
          the direction of the road.

          DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.

          APPROACHING.

                              KYLE
                    What the--?
          Michael turns, sees the lights.

                              MICHAEL
                    They're here.
          Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
          back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
          speechless.

                              MICHAEL
                    You're going to need this.
          Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.
          Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.

          HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.
          Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.

                              PERCY
                    Lord, have mercy.
                        (waving back Audrey and

                         SANDRA)
                    You ladies best get back inside.

                              SANDRA
                    What is it? What's happening? Who
                    is this man? Why's he driving a
                    police car?

                              AUDREY
                    Shut up, mom!

          

                                                                    41.

          

          
          Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
          Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one
          goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's
          hands, who stares down at it anxiously.

                               BOB
                    Wait. I don't think that's such a
                    good idea.

                              JEEP
                    Dad, I can handle it.

                              BOB
                        (to Michael)
                    He's just a kid --

                              JEEP
                    I said, I can handle it!
          Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.

                              MICHAEL
                    He can handle it. He doesn't have
                    a choice.
          Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
          everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
          men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.

                              MICHAEL
                    If you want to live, you'll do
                    exactly as I say.
          He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a
          Glock and hands it to her.

                               MICHAEL
                    When you fire, you keep your thumb
                    off the slide. Don't hesitate.
                    Don't do anything brave. There's
                    no safety.
          He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him
          but not sure why.
          Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
          others, then he bolts after Michael.
          Percy follows.   Then Charlie.
          Now it's only Jeep and his father left.

                              BOB
                    C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!

          

                                                                          42.

          

          
          And Bob rushes into the diner.
          A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.

          THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER.
          He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.

                                  JEEP
                     Fuck it.
          And races after his father.

                                                                     CUT TO:

          A DEAD BOLT
          Thrown.   Locking the diner door.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
          the door, sealing off the entrance.
          Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
          Window blinds are snap closed.

          

          THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in
          front of it.

          

          IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS
          The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF
          ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
          Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
          She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
          keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.

                                 HOWARD
                     Sandra?    What's happening?

                                  SANDRA
                     It's okay!     Everything's okay!
          Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it.
          Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into

          DARKNESS.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          
          We hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos.

                              BOB (V.O.)
                    Jeep, get the flashlights!

                              PERCY (V.O.)
                    Everybody just stay still!

                              KYLE (V.O.)
                    Now that we're locked in here, what
                    the fuck are we supposed to do?
          A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
          THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
          Michael looks up at the ceiling.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT

          A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
          and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
          "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
          The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
          WIND coming up off the desert.

                              KYLE
                    Where the hell did they go?
          Bob turns to Michael sharply.

                              BOB
                    Alright, Rambo. You got us up
                    here. Now you mind explaining what
                    the fuck we're fighting?
          Michael is about to answer, when:

                              PERCY
                    Listen!
          Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
          The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.

                              PERCY
                    You hear what I'm hearing?

                              BOB
                    Yeah...The hell is that?
          The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
          Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
          But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
          dread.

          

                                                                   44.

          

          

                              PERCY
                    It sounds almost like...

                                 KYLE
                    Ice cream.
          TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an
          ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE
          CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too
          dark to see who's behind the   wheel.

                              KYLE
                    You've got to be fuckin' kidding
                    me.

                              MICHAEL
                    Alright. There's a safety switch
                    on the side of your gun. Push it
                    all the way down. Two clicks.
          The men quickly do as they're told.

                              MICHAEL
                    Now when this starts, you hold on
                    tight, you hear me? If you don't,
                    you're going to blow your hand off.
                    Understand?
          Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.

                              PERCY
                    The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
          MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
          stop shaking, it might be believable.
          Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
          windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
          diner.
          Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
          Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
          hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
          Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

                               HOWARD
                    Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice
                    Cream Man.

          

                                                                      45.

          

          

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
          facing the diner.
          Everyone aims their guns at the truck.     Tense.
          From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
          ground.
          MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
          reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
          hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
          He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
          steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
          more clearly.
          He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
          And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
          taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
          for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
          the roof -- assessing the situation.
          On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.

                              KYLE

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Ah, he don't look that bad.
          The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.      He heard.

                                 KYLE
                    Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit.
          That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING

          TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
          AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
          sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
          From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
          shattering HOWL.
          Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
          fear.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Get ready!
          And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
          SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
          man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
          Michael aims.

          

                                                                       46.

          

          

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on
          his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
          mess.
          Michael keeps his aim.    Waits.   The CALLIOPE music continues
          to play.

                               KYLE
                     Is that it?
          Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
          freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the
          wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE

          COMMUTERS.

                                MICHAEL
                     Now!   Shoot now!
          The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.

          WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE!
          Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
          DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
          In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS

          PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
          FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
          mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.

                               MICHAEL
                     Spread out! Don't let them get
                     close to the windows!
          The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
          They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
          actually touch the ground.
          From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
          Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
          Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
          SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
          a sprinkler.
          BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
          seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
          their sheer numbers.
          With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
          diner.

          

                                                                        47.

          

          
          ON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's
          out of ammo.

                                 BOB
                    Shells!
          Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
          and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.

                                 BOB
                    Fuck!
          With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
          for the ammo. Stretching... Further...

          A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
          BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
          before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in
          tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
          clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
          Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
          to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
          Percy sees his friend in trouble.

                                 PERCY
                    Bob!
          Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
          bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
          even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
          can't stop!

          BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP

          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
          She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
          akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
          The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
          force halts Bob's slide.

                              PERCY
                        (extending his hook)
                    Grab my hand!
          Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
          on.
          But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
          Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!

                                 BOB
                    Gun!

          

                                                                     48.

          

          
          Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly
          catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman
          pounces on him.

                              BOB
                        (jamming the gun in her

                         MOUTH)
                    Fuck off!
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
          goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.

                              BOB
                    Pull me up!
          Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just
          outside.
          Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away,
          Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.
          Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to
          keep it together.
          Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the
          handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
          rattle the plates on the shelves.
          Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the
          front windows.
          Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
          Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad.

                              PERCY
                    Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on!
          Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated
          by the fire from the rooftop.

          

                                                                     49.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go
          wide as --
          SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass,
          sand and dust swirl in.
          Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
          Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
          Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
          for the intruder. It's so dark!

                              JEEP
                    Where is it?!
          Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
          looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
          too much.

                               AUDREY
                    Mom!   Open your eyes!

                               SANDRA
                    I can't!   I can't!
          Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
          got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!

                              SANDRA
                        (springing after her

                         HUSBAND)
                    Howard!
          Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
          the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
          desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
          Sandra scrambles after her husband.   Reaching for him.

                               AUDREY
                    Daddy!
          The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
          outstretched hands. She has him!
          The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
          window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
          falling across its face, reveals:
          A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly
          blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.

          

                                                                   50.

          
          Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
          flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
          of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.

                              TEENAGE GIRL
                    See what you made me do, mother!?
          Sandra screams, holds on.

                              SANDRA
                    No!
          Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
          arms.
          Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
          with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
          discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
          Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human
          tug-of-war.

          ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE

          CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.
          Howard's body lurches further out the window.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
          daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
          leverage.

          ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

          ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
          Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
          losing her grip on Howard's belt.
          Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
          LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
          his baby girl.

                              RAGGEDY MAN

                        (SWEETLY)
                    There you are!
          And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
          suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
          alone was their target.
          Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
          grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.

          

                                                                      51.

          

          
          Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
          Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
          window.

                                 AUDREY
                    Daddy!

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game
          on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.

                              KYLE
                    They're running!      We got `em!
          Kyle turns happily to Michael.     Gone.   Kyle looks around the
          roof with alarm.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
          through the window. Jeep's losing her!

          A FLASH OF STEEL.    SCHING!
          Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
          hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
          their owners.
          Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
          machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
          path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
          SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
          their first victim.
          Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
          Jeep scoot away from the window.
          Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
          after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!
          Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
          the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

                              SANDRA
                    He's alive!

                                 MICHAEL
                    No...     Not anymore.
          Sandra breaks down.

          

                                                                         52.

          

          
          As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.       She
          clutches her belly. Winces.
          Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

                              CHARLIE

                        (RECOVERING)
                    I'm okay. I'm fine.
          She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Thanks...

                              MICHAEL
                    I told you not to do anything
                    brave.
          Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say
          something when --
          Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.

                              KYLE
                    We got `em runnin'!
          Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
          excitement falling.

                              KYLE
                    Where's Howard?
          No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.
          Crying.
          Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
          adrenaline.

                              MICHAEL
                    Someone needs to be on the roof.

                                 KYLE
                    I'll go.
          Bob grabs Kyle's arm.

                              BOB
                    Hold on.
                        (approaches Michael,

                         DETERMINED)
                    You better start talking.
          All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally:

          

                                                          53.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The first time God lost faith in
                    Man he sent a flood. The second
                    time...he sent what you see
                    outside.
          Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:

                              PERCY
                    You sayin' this is the
                    Apocalypse...?

                               MICHAEL
                    I'm saying this is an
                    extermination.

                        (BEAT)
                    Those things out there are vessels.
                    The Possessed. The weakest willed
                    are the easiest to turn.

                              KYLE
                    Possessed by what?    Demons?

                              MICHAEL
                    No...by angels.
          That silences the room.

                              PERCY
                        (pulls out his bible)
                    Son, I don't know what bible you
                    been readin', but in my version,
                    the angels are the good guys.
          Michael looks squarely at Percy.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's where your book is wrong.

                              SANDRA
                    How come you know so much about
                    them?

                              MICHAEL
                    I know because until last night, I
                    was on their side.

                              JEEP
                    You mean you're...
          Michael considers Jeep, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Not anymore...

          

                                                                     54.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Right and yesterday I was the
                    fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,
                    fuck this. I don't even believe in
                    God.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's fine, because He doesn't
                    believe in you either.
          Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.

                              PERCY
                    C'mon, Bob. Have you looked
                    outside recently? Those aren't
                    exactly our regular customers out
                    there.

                              BOB
                    How do we know he didn't bring them
                    here himself?

                              CHARLIE
                    He brings them here and then he
                    saves us from them? You're a
                    genius, Bob.
          Bob falls silent, confounded.
          Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.

                              AUDREY
                    So you're here to protect us?

                               MICHAEL
                    Not you...
                         (looks at Charlie)
                    Her.
          Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.

                               CHARLIE
                    Me?!   Why me?!

                              MICHAEL
                    Because your child is the only hope
                    humanity has of surviving.
          In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
          do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.

                               CHARLIE
                    No way!
          But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes
          genuine fear.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              CHARLIE

                        (STUNNED)
                    Jesus Christ...

                               MICHAEL
                    Exactly.
          Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
          starting to make sense.

                              JEEP
                    You're sayin' she's the mother of
                    the Messiah?

                              BOB
                    Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed
                    to be a vi--

                              CHARLIE
                    Go fuck yourself, Bob!

                              PERCY
                    Makes you wonder about Mary.

                              CHARLIE
                        (approaches Michael, panic
                         setting in)
                    Look, this is not possible! I'm
                    just a waitress! I'm nobody! I
                    can't give birth to the Savior of
                    Mankind!
                        (and finally)
                    I don't even own a car!

                              MICHAEL
                    None of that matters anymore.
                    Either your child lives or Mankind
                    dies.

                              KYLE
                    So what, we're supposed to just
                    hold those things off until Mary
                    over there squeezes one out?

                              MICHAEL
                    That's right.

                              CHARLIE
                    That can't be. I'm only eight
                    months pregnant.

                              KYLE
                    Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked!

          

                                                                      56.

          

          

                              SANDRA
                    How are we supposed to survive here
                    for a month?

                              MICHAEL
                    We won't have to...
          At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.

                              CHARLIE
                    It's coming soon, isn't it?
          Michael nods.
          Charlie sways on her feet.   Jeep rests a hand on her
          shoulder, steadying her.
          With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
          with finality.

                               MICHAEL
                    If you want to live you'll do what
                    I say. This first attack was a
                    test of our strength. The next one
                    will be a test of our weakness.

                        (BEAT)
                    Something much worse is on its way.
          Everyone exchanges terrified looks.   Finally, Kyle steps
          forward.

                              KYLE
                    Okay, what's your plan?

                              MICHAEL
                    We'll keep watch on the roof in
                    shifts of two. Jeep, go get some
                    tools. We need to close up this
                    window before somebody else goes
                    out.
          Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he
          follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the
          SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT

          Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're
          wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from
          the cold and the flies.
          Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
          darkness.

          

                                                                   57.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    They're out there. Sons of
                    bitches. I can feel `em.

                        (BEAT)
                    Damn it's cold!
          Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
          together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog
          tags.

                              KYLE
                    You were in the Army?

                              PERCY
                    Navy, two tours. But the second
                    one didn't work out so well, so I
                    didn't get to go back for a third.
                    Suppose that makes me lucky in a
                    way. Served with Bob, you know.
                    That's how I ended up in this
                    place.

                              KYLE
                    What was it like?    Being in a war?

                               PERCY
                    Dark.   Like this.
          Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches
          it from hand to hand.

                              PERCY
                    So what's with that gun?

                               KYLE
                    What?

                              PERCY
                    Your piece. The one you killed
                    grandma with. Don't reckon it's
                    for huntin' buck.

                              KYLE
                    No. I uh -- keep it for
                    protection.

                              PERCY
                    Protection from what?

                              KYLE
                    From people.
          Percy looks at him skeptically.

                               PERCY
                    People.

          

                                                                     58.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, people who might try to give
                    me a hard time, you know?

                              PERCY
                    Just regular people or uh...

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, well, no, not regular,
                    regular people.

                              PERCY
                    Irregular people then.

                               KYLE
                    I'm talkin' people whose job it is
                    to give other people a hard time.
                    Kinda person who doesn't get enough
                    fiber in their diet, you know what
                    I'm sayin?

                              PERCY
                    So it's a work thing, is it?

                                KYLE
                    Exactly.    Strictly business.

                              PERCY
                    This business of yours... You like
                    it?
          Kyle's eyes narrow.

                              KYLE
                    Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'
                    me, man? I got my reasons for
                    doin' what I do.
          Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally:

                              PERCY
                    When I was a kid my father would
                    sit by my bed every night before
                    I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,
                    Percy, if you don't wake up
                    tomorrow, if it turns out that
                    today was your last day on earth,
                    would you be proud of what you've
                    done in this life? Cuz if you
                    ain't, then you better start
                    gettin' square.
          Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
          the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.

                                                                CUT TO:

          

                                                                     59.

          

          

          

          THE SILVER ZIPPO
          rolls between dirty fingers.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - NIGHT

          Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
          some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every
          few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it
          down fast enough.
          Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
          prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
          around.
          Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
          another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
          places it in front of her.

                              BOB
                    On the house.
          She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip.

                                 SANDRA
                    Thanks.

                              BOB
                    You hungry?

                              SANDRA
                    Couldn't eat if my life depended on
                    it.

                              BOB
                    Well I figure just cuz the world's
                    coming to an end, it doesn't mean a
                    man's gotta starve. All I can say
                    is thank heavens they left the gas
                    on.
          Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it.

                              SANDRA
                    Never much cared for beer.
                    Howard's the beer drinker in the
                    family.
          The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
          again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses
          them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This
          is a battle she's losing.

          

                                                                  60.

          

          
          Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling
          with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.
          Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.
          Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
          nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
          eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two
          jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.

                              JEEP
                    What did you do...you know, before
                    you came here...?
          Michael considers the question a beat, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    I was a soldier, a general, in His
                    army.

                              JEEP
                    Well, what changed?   What made you
                    leave?

                              MICHAEL
                    I was given an order I didn't
                    believe in...
                        (off Jeep's look:)
                    He lost faith. I hadn't.
          Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.

                              JEEP
                    So what happens to you...after this
                    is over?
          Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Sometimes we have to face the thing
                    we fear the most in order to be
                    free of it.
          Michael picks up his gun.

                              MICHAEL
                    It's almost time for the next
                    shift.
          Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
          deep in thought.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAWN

          The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty
          haze. A new day has forced itself into existence.
          TITLE:   "December 24th - 6:05am"

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - MORNING

          Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for
          movement. His expression focused, determined.
          On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to
          stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Sandra awakens with a start.

                                 SANDRA
                     Howard?
          But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
          still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her
          fear is returning.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the
          mirror. A living wreck.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra steps out of the bathroom.

                               VOICE
                         (a whisper)
                     Sandra...
          Sandra freezes.

                               SANDRA
                     Who's there?
          A beat then:

                                 VOICE
                     Sandra...
          Sandra spins around.    Searching.

          

                                                                      62.

          

          

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard?     Is that you?
          It sure sounded like Howard.

                                 VOICE
                    Help me...     Please...
          This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra
          turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.
          Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.

                              VOICE
                        (from behind the door)
                    Help me. Sandra...
          Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do?
          That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.
          She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see
          out.

          SANDRA'S POV:
          Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED

          TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.
          But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
          black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
          breathing.
          Sandra goes slack with horror.

                              HOWARD
                    Help me, please!
          Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
          covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
          away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
          Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

                                 AUDREY
                    Mom!
          Kyle races to restrain Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!

          

                                                                     63.

          

          
          She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags
          Kyle in the face. Down he goes.
          Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the
          sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be
          heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.
          Sleep.

          RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...
          Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
          hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
          appears in the doorway.
          Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
          that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
          Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive.
          Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy.

                                SANDRA
                    Howard!
          And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
          -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
          streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
          -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
          from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
          stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
          SLAMMING closed behind them.
          Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
          the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
          But she's not fighting anymore.
          Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
          back to the door, breathing heavily.

          

                                                                        64.

          

          

                                 CHARLIE
                       Percy?
          He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
          The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away.

                                                                CUT TO:

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - FREEZER ROOM - DAY

          Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully
          at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his
          face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.
          Jeep watches his father from the doorway.

                                 JEEP
                       We should get back out there...

                                 BOB
                       Just gimme another minute with him,
                       okay?
          Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
          friend.

                                                                CUT TO:

          

          SANDRA'S FACE
          Catatonic.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
          looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
          know.
          Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
          never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
          her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
          making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
          In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
          her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.
          Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.

          

                                                                       65.

          

          
          She brings her ear up close.      Wait.   Is that a VOICE?
          She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into
          focus. CLEARER.

                                 AUDREY
                     Hey...
          CLEARER.   Yes.   It's a VOICE!

                               AUDREY
                     Hey! You guys, I think I got
                     something here!
          Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
          the radio.

          THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE.      STRAINED

          BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.

                                RADIO VOICE
                     ... battling has been fierce. The
                     numbers of casualties are unknown
                     but all indications are that they
                     must be unimaginably large.

                         (BEAT)
                     If you're just joining us, we're
                     getting some of the first bits of
                     good news, if you can call it that,
                     since this apocalypse began just
                     twenty-four ago. A human militia
                     has formed on the outskirts of Las
                     Vegas and has begun to engage the
                     enemy. Also down in the Four
                     Corners area, we've been receiving
                     unconfirmed reports of another
                     resistance force gathering in Red
                     Rock National in the northern
                     Mojave Desert area.

                               JEEP

                               CHARLIE
                     That can't be more than an hour up
                     the highway from here.

                               AUDREY
                     Does that mean we can leave?

                                 MICHAEL
                     No.    We're not going anywhere.

                               BOB
                     What the hell are you talkin'
                     about? This is our chance!

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                                  MICHAEL
                       We can't risk being on the move
                       when the child comes. It's too
                       dangerous.
          Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
          anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and
          races for the bathroom.

                                 RADIO VOICE
                       ... And as we fight this new
                       enemy, may God give us the strength
                       to survive and show mercy for those
                       of us who are already lost...

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A CIGARETTE
          being lit.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water
          running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,
          feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.
          Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her
          hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her
          eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.
          She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.

          

          INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,
          wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.

                                 JEEP (O.S.)
                       Guess it's your turn not to sleep.
          Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.

                                   CHARLIE
                       Hey...
          Jeep sees the strain on her face.

                                   JEEP
                       You okay?

          

                                                                     67.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    You mean besides the fact that I
                    just found out that I'm the mother
                    of the Messiah?
          Jeep smiles, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    Crazy thing is...I didn't want this
                    baby. I even went down to the
                    clinic, you know that?
                        (off Jeep's reaction:)
                    I remember sitting there in the
                    waiting room, absolutely sure I was
                    doin' the right thing...And that's
                    when the feeling started. Like I
                    was falling into the deepest,
                    darkest hole imaginable. I
                    couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
                    I kept thinking this must be what
                    death is like. And when finally
                    they called my name, I ran.

                        (BEAT)
                    For a while after that I tried
                    pretending that it was just cold
                    feet, that I could go back if I
                    wanted to, that I could decide to
                    end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
                    start to have that feeling again
                    and I knew I didn't have a choice.
                    Somehow this had already been
                    decided. And it made me hate this
                    thing that's been growing inside
                    me.
          A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:

                              JEEP
                    You shouldn't say things like that,
                    Charlie. It isn't right. You'll
                    get through this. I know you will.
          She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:

                              CHARLIE
                    How come you have so much faith in
                    me, Jeep? God knows I've never
                    given you or anybody else a reason
                    to. Or is it that you just can't
                    find any other hard-luck case to
                    follow around?
          Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated.

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    You know, you're not the only who's
                    suffered, okay? Let me know when
                    you stop feeling sorry for
                    yourself.
          And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
          after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.
          Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping
          watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.

                              KYLE
                    ...Then you just flip this --
          Audrey flips the safety.

                              AUDREY
                    Yeah, I got it. All the way down.
                    Two clicks.
          She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding
          one all her life.
          Off Kyle's surprised look:

                              AUDREY
                    Dated this guy last summer. A
                    marine. Had a thing for guns.
                    Parents hated him.

                              KYLE
                    I bet they did.
          After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands
          the gun over to Kyle.
          Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
          expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years
          overnight.

                              AUDREY
                    My parents hate everything I do.
                    That's why we were moving.

                                KYLE
                    Yeah?

          

                                                                         69.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                    They thought a more "wholesome"
                    environment would help me "change
                    my ways." So fucked up. Only
                    reason they care at all is cuz they
                    don't want to be embarrassed in
                    front of their friends at the
                    country club.
          Kyle considers her thoughtfully.

                              KYLE
                    The only time my old man ever paid
                    attention to me was when I was
                    doing somethin' bad. So you know
                    what I did?

                               AUDREY
                    What?

                              KYLE
                    I got really good at being bad.
          She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He
          wipes a tear from her cheek.
          She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately.
          His hands trace over her body.
          She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
          She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
          It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
          She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head
          back. Further.
          Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
          to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
          red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
          Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's
          FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
          The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
          "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
          Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
          The electric fan spins on above the grill.

          

                                                                    70.

          

          
          Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
          window.
          Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
          Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.

                              BOB
                    We back in business?

                              MICHAEL
                    I don't think so.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
          didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
          as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
          dramatic change.

                              AUDREY
                    Is it over?

                              KYLE
                    I don't know.
          HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.

                              KYLE
                        (raising his gun)
                    You better get downstairs.

                              AUDREY
                    No, I can handle it.
          Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he
          pulls out his silver 45.

                              KYLE
                        (handing her the gun)
                    Just in case.
          The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
          the highway to stop at the pumps.

                                 KYLE
                    Get ready.
          They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
          A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
          He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
          coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
          YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.

          

                                                                     71.

          

          
          He races around to the gas pump.

                              KYLE
                        (lowering his gun)
                    Wait a minute.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle, are they...
          A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
          out over the back side of the diner.
          AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
          Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the
          pump. Flips the lever.

                              KYLE
                    It's a trap. They saw them coming
                    and turned on the lights. It's a
                    fucking trap!
          Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.

                             KYLE AND AUDREY
                    Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a
                    trap!
          But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
          WIND as he pumps the gas.
          Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM!
          At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
          roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
          HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
          he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
          Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    They're not gonna make it.
          The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the
          door.
          But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
          to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
          His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
          Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
          surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
          The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
          the vehicle by skeletal hands.

          

                                                                      72.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                        (pushing his barrel down)
                    Wait! You'll hit them too!
          So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
          the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
          ground in front of the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle!
          Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
          woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
          He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
          that comes at him.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward
          the pumps.

                               BOB
                    Jesus Christ, what the hell is that
                    boy doin'!

                              CHARLIE
                    We have to get `im back in here!
          Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the
          front door.
          The sound of a gun COCKING.
          Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    Don't. You open that door and we
                    could all be dead.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
          agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
          He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
          huddled around them.
          He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
          covering his face.
          Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          

                                 KYLE
                    I got you!
          Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
          The creatures have stopped coming at him.
          In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting.
          Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
          wrong.

                                 YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
                    Mister...
          Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES
          stare back at him.

                               YOUNG BOY

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Fooled ya.

          A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.
          Kyle drops to his knees.
          Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.

                                 AUDREY
                    Kyle!

          Bob kicks over a table in disgust.

                              BOB
                    Damn it all to hell!

                               CHARLIE
                    Oh, no.   Audrey...
          Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
          run towards Kyle.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life
          drain from his body.
          The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
          suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to
          her.

          

                                                                      74.

          

          

                                 YOUNG BOY
                    I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to!

                                 AUDREY
                    Fuck you!
          Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK.
          She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing.
          The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
          eerie calm for someone so young.

                              YOUNG BOY
                    You're gonna die now.
          The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.
          Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
          diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
          They're everywhere.    She's trapped.
          She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS.
          Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
          closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!
          She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press
          against the windows. A nightmare come to life.

          Charlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then:

                        (raising his guns)
                    Open the door.
          Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the
          dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed
          Charlie and out into hell.

          With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.
          IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.
          She's running out of time.
          Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at
          the minivan. What's he up to?
          The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if
          they've just now noticed him.
          And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,
          there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his
          other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
          The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!
          The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.
          Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through
          the night.
          The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of
          glass.
          Michael drops the gas pump.
          He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and
          unlocks the door.
          Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

          BY A RING OF FIRE.

                              MICHAEL
                    Come with me.
          Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
          Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.

                              MICHAEL
                    Run.

          And together they run toward the open diner door.

          Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.
          Audrey is the first one in.
          Michael is almost there.   But the fire is faster, ENGULFING

          HIM IN FLAME!

                               CHARLIE
                    Michael!

                              BOB
                        (pulling Charlie away from
                         the door)
                    Get back!
          BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into
          the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF

          FIRE REACHES THEM.
          Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS
          covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.
          Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.   Jeep and Bob
          rush to pat him down.
          Audrey's coughing from the smoke.

                              CHARLIE
                    I'll get some water!
          Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up
          a pitcher of water.
          She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...
          And SCREAMS!
          The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her
          wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.
          The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.
          The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress
          outfit covering her pregnant belly.
          Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She
          frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.

          

                                                                       77.

          

          
          But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
          to maneuver.

                                 YOUNG BOY
                       C'mon, don't be scared. I just
                       wanna play with your baby.
          That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter!
          The boy raises the knife to strike.
          Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
          front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
          CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
          hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
          blade.
          The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
          The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
          there's no knife.
          Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
          THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
          Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
          boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
          Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
          guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

                                 MICHAEL
                       Are you hurt?
          Charlie shakes her head no.

                                 CHARLIE
                       Where is he?!
          That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE

          DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.

                                 JEEP'S VOICE
                       He's still in here!
          FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
          LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables.

                                 BOB'S VOICE
                       Where the fuck is he?!
          A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track
          the location of the sound.

          

                                                                       78.

          

          
          As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is
          heard in another.
          Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.      A TRAIL OF

          BLOOD.

                                JEEP
                      He's bleeding!

          THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE

          BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...

          A WALL...
          Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD

          REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.

                                BOB
                      What the fuck?

          SCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND

          LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.
          Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
          strong arms away from his neck.

                                   JEEP
                      Dad!
          Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air.
          Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
          back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.

                                   MICHAEL
                      Get ready!
          Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked
          creature into the air.
          Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
          GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
          And then in moments...      All is QUIET.
          BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She
          WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.

                                   CHARLIE
                      Oh, no!
          Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down
          Charlie's legs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT.   PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

          Inky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the
          diner.
          TITLE:   "December 25th - 3:33am"
          The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

          Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
          Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her
          legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.

                               AUDREY
                     What am I supposed to do? Just
                     `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I
                     automatically know how to do this!

                               MICHAEL
                     Just do as I say.

                               AUDREY
                     Yeah, but, how do you know how to
                     do this?!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Bob and Jeep keep watch.
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
          -- closer.
          Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.

                                BOB
                     What a way to bring a child into
                     the world.
                         (looks over at Jeep)
                     She ever tell you his name?

                               JEEP
                     She's never said. I just assumed
                     it was Joe Danvers. You know how
                     she's always had a thing for bad
                     boys.
          Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.

          

                                                                     80.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Jeep, sooner or later she'll
                    realize you're the best thing
                    that's ever happened to her.

                              JEEP
                    I thought you said I should move
                    on?

                              BOB
                    Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
          Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
          A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
          if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.

                              JEEP
                    What was that...?
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
          numbers.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.
          Audrey arrives with more steaming water.

                              AUDREY
                    What is that?!

                              MICHAEL
                    He's coming. We have to hurry.

                              AUDREY
                    Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?
                    This isn't something you can
                    exactly hurry, is it?

                              MICHAEL
                    Charlie, I need you to push. I
                    need you to push as hard as you
                    can.

                              AUDREY
                    Michael, who's coming?!
          Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
          pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.

                              MICHAEL
                    We're almost there...

          

                                                                    81.

          

          

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
          closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
          stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.

                              JEEP
                    We're not gonna make it outta here,
                    are we?
          Bob looks at his son.   The agony stretched across his face.

                              BOB
                    I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be
                    happening to you...
          Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
          pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
          filling his eyes.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
          agonizing SCREAM...
          ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.   Audrey, eyes wide, holds
          up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.

                              AUDREY
                    Oh my god...we did it!    Charlie,
                    you did it!
          Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
          baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
          it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
          to make, even at this late hour.

                              AUDREY

                        (CONFUSED)
                    It's okay. The baby's okay.
          Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't...I...
          Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.

                              MICHAEL
                    Take him... Give her a minute.
          Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
          soothe him by pacing around the diner.

          

                                                                        82.

          

          

                                AUDREY
                      It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...
          Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing.
          Closer.
          Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
          trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
          of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
          SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
          Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares
          at him, a burning spite in her eyes.

                                CHARLIE
                      So are we safe now?   Is it over?

                                MICHAEL
                      No. Killing the child would have
                      ended the war before it had begun.
                      Now, at least, he will have a
                      chance to grow up, a chance to lead
                      the world out of darkness.
          Those words provide her little comfort.

                                CHARLIE
                      And what happens until then...?

                                MICHAEL
                      You'll need to teach him how.
          Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.

                                CHARLIE
                      What makes you think I can do that?
                      What makes you think I want to do
                      that? If he's so important, why
                      don't you take him?

                                MICHAEL
                      Each of us has a burden. This one
                      is yours and yours alone. Maybe
                      someday you'll understand what that
                      means.
          Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
          approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
          how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
          see her in such a demoralized state.

                                AUDREY
                      Mama? Can you hear me?
                          (holds up the baby)
                      We did it...The baby's alive.

                                (MORE)

          

                                                                   83.

                        (BEAT)
                    Mama?
          If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.
          Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her
          mother. But we HOLD here and...
          DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are
          loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's
          cut through her skin.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES
          reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about
          frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back
          away from the diner.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light
          above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
          a desert town a long time ago.
          THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
          All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
          the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
          further away from the diner we get.

          

          HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP
          In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
          creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the
          truck stop.
          The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.

          AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A

          BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie
          to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of
          bloody blankets cradled in her arms.

                              JEEP
                    Something's happening.    They're
                    moving away.

          

                                                                       84.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The Possessed can't come near the
                    child, so He sent someone that can.
                    Someone like me.

                                 BOB
                    Who?

                              MICHAEL
                    Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come
                    to do what I wouldn't.
          ON JEEP as the realization hits him.

                              JEEP
                    Your orders...
          Michael looks at Jeep.

                              JEEP
                    You were the one who was supposed
                    to kill the baby? That was the
                    order you didn't obey.
          Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.

                              CHARLIE
                    What's he talking about?
          The baby CRIES LOUDER.

                              CHARLIE
                    Michael, what the hell's he talking
                    about?!

                              MICHAEL
                    There was never meant to be a
                    Second Coming. But we've just
                    changed that. The child lives.
                    The future is unwritten. There's
                    still hope.
          Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Audrey...?
          Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...

          ...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND

          SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
          Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
          Hers is the face of madness.

          

                                                                    85.

          

          

                               SANDRA
                     Stay away from me!    Don't come any
                     closer!

                                AUDREY
                     Mom!

                               BOB
                     Don't do it, lady!

                               SANDRA
                     You heard what he said. They just
                     want the baby. Maybe if we just
                     give it to them, then they'll let
                     us go!
          Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.

          THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN

          THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
          Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     Give him to me!

                               SANDRA
                     Why?! You never wanted him in the
                     first place!
          Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
          rattling her to the very core.

                                CHARLIE
                     No...   I...
          Sandra is almost to the front door.

                               SANDRA
                     It's just one baby.   Just one.

          CRASH!   THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
          A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
          Sandra is blinded.   She raises a hand to block the light.
          And that's when Michael fires.    BLAM!
          Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
          forehead, and...

          ...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
          Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...   And
          everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

          

                                                                     86.

          

          
          Michael fires again.   Blowing Sandra's body back through the
          doorway.
          Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
          The time for Jeep to act is now!
          Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
          inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
          The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
          spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
          Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
          diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
          This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
          scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
          insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
          they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
          The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
          And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
          striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
          for brothers.
          His name is GABRIEL.
          Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
          looking MACE in his powerful hands.
          And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
          mace arcing down at Jeep.
          Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
          floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
          Gabriel brings the mace up again.   Jeep won't be so lucky
          twice.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Sonuvabitch!
          Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
          Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
          himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
          him.
          But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
          with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
          child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
          pulls the child protectively to her chest.

          

                                                                    87.

          

          
          Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
          like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
          Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
          His gun falling from his hands.
          Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

                               JEEP
                    No!
          With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
          diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
          stove.
          Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
          the fray.

                               MICHAEL
                    No, Jeep! You must protect the
                    child now!

                               JEEP
                    Me?!   What about you?

                              MICHAEL
                    My path ends here. You are the
                    true protector. You always have
                    been.
          Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.

                              JEEP
                    But I don't know what to do!

                              MICHAEL
                    Find the Prophets.   Learn to read
                    the instructions.
          Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
          Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.

                              JEEP
                    Prophets? What Prophets?   What
                    instructions?!
          And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
          Michael's Police Cruiser.
          Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
          baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
          his hand around the keys, determination building.

                               JEEP
                    C'mon!

          

                                                                  88.

          

          
          Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Wait!     We can't leave him!

                              JEEP
                    We have no choice!    We have to get
                    to Red Rock!
          He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
          Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
          ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
          Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
          hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
          BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
          Jeep is terrified.

                                 JEEP
                    Dad!
          Jeep tries to help him up.

                              BOB
                    Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here,
                    remember?

                              JEEP
                    But Dad...!
          Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:

                                 BOB
                    Run.
          And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door.
          Charlie opens it.    Sand swirls in around her.
          And Jeep leads the trio out the door.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
          enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
          family conflict.

          

                                                                    89.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
                    were always so eager to please Him.

                              GABRIEL
                    Unlike you...the rebellious son.
                        (noticing Michael's scars)
                    Pity about your wings. They would
                    have helped you now.

                              MICHAEL
                    To not feel their burden...is a
                    dream.

                              GABRIEL
                    You think you can defy Him and not
                    pay the price?

                              MICHAEL
                    The child lives. What happens to
                    me doesn't matter now.

                               GABRIEL
                    Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
                    can help them sneak out the back
                    door, but they won't escape.

                        (BEAT)
                    And neither will you, brother.
          Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.

                               MICHAEL

                        (SOFT)
                    I'm not running anymore.
          Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not
          what he was expecting.

                              MICHAEL

                        (SENSING)
                    Join with me. You don't need do
                    this. There's another way.
          A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.

                              GABRIEL
                    There is no other way...
          He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
          LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
          wasn't bad-ass enough.
          And the fight begins.

          

                                                                    90.

          

          
          It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
          under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
          weapon.
          With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
          speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
          place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
          Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
          the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
          Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
          fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
          into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
          Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
          lands on the counter.
          Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
          sending him fluttering back.
          Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs
          again.
          Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
          and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
          Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
          Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
          punches.
          Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts
          his mace and thrusts with it.
          Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
          wall.
          Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
          A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
          back, losing his grip on the weapon.
          Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
          Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
          off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
          the life out of Gabriel.

          Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of
          the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by
          winds and sand.
          Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat
          while Audrey hustles in back.

          

                                                                    91.

          

          
          Jeep rounds to the driver's side.     Hops in.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the
          ignition.
          It's in.
          Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
          Panic.

                               CHARLIE
                     Come on, Jeep!

                               JEEP
                     I'm trying!
          Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.
          A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light
          catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a
          SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely
          distended.
          Charlie screams.

                                JEEP
                     Fuck!
          Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
          The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass

                               JEEP
                         (throwing the car in

                          REVERSE)
                     Hang on!
          Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards
          toward the highway.

          BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!
          Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full
          180 onto the road.

          THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.
          Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises
          from the pavement.
          Pedal to the metal.

          

                                                                  92.

          

          
          The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into
          him.
          BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over
          the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a
          cloud of dust.
          Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.

                              JEEP
                    Okay, we need to figure out our
                    weapon situation.   Hopefully
                    Michael didn't take everything out
                    of the car.
          Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
          police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie
          searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE.

                              CHARLIE
                    Is this what I think it is?

                             JEEP
                    Yes. Now just put it down...
                    Slowly.
          Charlie places it onto the seat.
          Audrey fishes around in the backseat.

                              AUDREY
                        (holding up each item)
                    Okay, all I got is a flare gun
                    thing. Looks like we got a box of
                    flares to go with it.

                               JEEP
                    Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A
                    a flare gun... And a grenade.
                    Alright.
                        (hands Charlie the Glock)
                    Load this.

                        (BEAT)
                    Audrey, can you figure out how to
                    load that flare gun without killing
                    us all?

                                 AUDREY
                    I can try.

                              JEEP
                    Try real hard, okay?
          Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.

          

                                                                     93.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He
          fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
          Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
          hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
          Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
          Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
          mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
          Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
          Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
          Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal
          struggle.
          Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
          reach.
          He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
          angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
          strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
          Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
          mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
          wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
          both through.
          Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
          Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right
          through his heart.
          Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
          as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
          left in this guy.
          Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening.
          Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood
          leaking from his mouth.

                              GABRIEL
                    You always wanted to live like one
                    of them...Now you'll know how it
                    feels to die like one of them.
          Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head.
          Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting.
          The mace comes swinging down...

          

                                                                       94.

          PING!   PING!   PING!   Driving blind!
          ON THE SPEEDOMETER as their speed slows to a crawl.

          Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby.
          ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in.

          Gabriel is looking down upon Michael's broken body.
          Something is happening to his skin. The DARK WRITING THAT
          COVERS HIS BODY is beginning UN-WRITE itself and DISAPPEAR...

          Charlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the
          inflow of BUZZING insects. It's not working!
          She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more
          frightening catches her attention.
          The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm,
          snaking its way up from his wrists like VINES.

                               CHARLIE
                     Jeep, your arm!
          Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.

                               CHARLIE
                     What is it?
          A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...

          Gabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from
          Michael's body when he hears a faint CLICKING sound from
          somewhere in the diner.
          Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward
          the source of the CLICKING.
          He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
          pool of blood.
          It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
          sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.
          Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to
          lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
          Bob looks at Gabriel.

                               BOB
                    Sorry...   We're closed.
          And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO

          IGNITES.
          Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of
          the stove's broken gas line.
          Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes.

          A STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS

          INTO AWESOME FIERY FLIGHT.

          The MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the slow moving vehicle.
          In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the CLOUD OF FIRE
          MUSHROOMING UP in the sky behind them. It's eerily
          magnificent.

                              CHARLIE
                    The swarm, it's fading!
          Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM
          suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW
          of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good
          fortune has come.

          

                                                                     96.

          eyes her.

          Charlie's reacts, a bit stung.
          Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned
          at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey
          leans in from the back seat.

          GABRIEL SMASHES DOWN ON THE CRUISER'S ROOF WITH MASSIVE

          Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.

          

                                                                     98.

          Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide
          off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the
          rear window frame for support.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body
          through the broken back window toward Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    Jeep!
          Jeep swings the gun around.

                              JEEP
                    Duck!
          BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow
          him down.

                              JEEP
                    Audrey, the flare gun!
          Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding
          Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the
          risk of hitting Audrey.
          Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.
          Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her
          hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes
          off INSIDE THE CAR!
          Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS
          through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!
          Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the
          windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING

          HIS HAIR ABLAZE.
          And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.
          BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear
          window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to
          pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.
          Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK.    No bullets!
          Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to
          fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the
          side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.

          

                                                                     99.

          

          
          Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.
          Jeep knows there's only one thing to do.

                              JEEP
                    Get down on the floor!
          Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in
          front of the passenger seat.
          Jeep PUNCHES IT.   The speedometer leaps ahead.

          70...80...90...
          Gabriel's now completely in the car.   They're helpless.
          Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie,
          his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when...

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
                    Get off her, you fucking asshole!
          Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just
          in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides
          him like one helluva a cowboy.

          100...110...120...

                              AUDREY
                    Do it, Jeep! Do it now!

          JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING

          FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.
          The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road
          with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS

          The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and
          careening into a large rock formation.
          This ride is over.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his
          forehead.
          Charlie crawls up from the floor.

                              CHARLIE
                    C'mon, Jeep!

          

                                                                    100.

          

          
          He tries to focus on her.

                                CHARLIE
                    Jeep!
          She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.

                                JEEP
                    The baby?

                                CHARLIE
                    Alive.

                              JEEP
                    And what about...

                              CHARLIE
                    Nothing could have survived that.

                              JEEP

                        (ANGUISHED)
                    Audrey...

                              CHARLIE
                    She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved
                    us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
          Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from
          the demolished Cruiser.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the
          long climb up the ridge.
          Charlie looks up.
          STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking.

                              CHARLIE
                    How can this happen?

                                JEEP
                    What?

                               CHARLIE
                    How can this happen in a world so
                    beautiful?
          Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.
          Endless stars.    Confounding.
          Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.

          

                                                                    101.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, we're almost there.
          They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --

          GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
          Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
          just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
          a cloud of dust.
          Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
          done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
          Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
          a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
          visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
          Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
          Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
          hand.
          Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
          rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
          knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
          Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
          Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
          again.
          Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his
          fists. This kid will simply not give up.
          Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
          shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
          off the ground.

                              GABRIEL
                    So brave. So pointless. You
                    should have worried more about
                    saving yourself.
          Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
          Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
          Charlie watches in horror.

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop!   Please! Don't kill him!
          But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
          consciousness. The battle is lost.

                              GABRIEL
                    Go to sleep...
          Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.

          

                                                                   102.

          

          

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
          This gets Gabriel's attention.
          Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
          him.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't want this responsibility!
          Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious.
          Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping
          desperately for air.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, no!
          Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.

                              GABRIEL
                    "And as the child's cries are
                    extinguished, an eternal darkness
                    at last descended upon the world."
          He peels the cloth back, revealing...

          THE GRENADE.
          He spins around to face Charlie.
          She's holding the pin.

          KABOOM!

          GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
          The creature is gone at last.
          The sound of a BABY COOING.
          Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
          She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
          their way to the top of the ridge.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
          ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
          Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

          

                                                                      103.

          

          

                               JEEP
                     We made it.

                               CHARLIE
                     Yep, we sure did.
          And now we see it too:

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          Vast.   Barren.   No signs of life.
          No resistance force.    No nothing.

          

          ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
          Taking it in.     Breathing hard.

                               JEEP
                     I'm sure they're just over the next
                     ridge.
          He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     What if we're on our own now?

                                JEEP
                     Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.

                         (BEAT)
                     Believe me.
          At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.       Sees a
          confidence in them she's never seen before.
          And she leans in and kisses him.      Tender.
          When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.      Then
          the surprise melts into a smile.
          And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
          view once again of --

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The
          unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.
          And we're back where we started.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

          

                                                                   104.

          

          

          IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    Someday when my son is older, I
                    will tell him about the time of his
                    birth when all the world was
                    covered in a great darkness...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

          Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
          experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
          INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
          gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... And how just at the moment when
                    everything seemed lost...
          Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
          It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
          family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
          WEAPONRY in the back seat.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    ...a mighty warrior fell in order
                    to save me.
          Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby.   He smiles at the
          image of maternal bliss.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    And a boy faced his fear and rose
                    up to save us all.
          The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with
          its fiery light.

          

                                     THE END

          INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING


          
          Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
          BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.

                                MS. BERRY
                    "Work." Today we're going to
                    share what our parents do for
                    work.
          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
          their desks, addressing the class:

                              JEFF
                    My dad is a truck driver.

                              MELINDA
                    My mommy is a doctor.

                                CAROLYN
                    My dad is a librarian and my
                    mom is a vegetarian.

                              THEODORE
                          (with difficulty)
                    My father is a struck-sher-al-
                    engine-ear.

                                CRAIG     -
                    My mother is an actress. She
                    works at Denny's.

                                KELLY
                    My daddy works at a place
                    where they make stuff, and my
                    mommy is a mommy.

                                ELLIOT
                          (looking a little

                           CRAZED)
                    My father is a postal worker.
          The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:

                              MAX
                    My mom's a teacher.
          As Max starts to sit:

                              MS. BERRY
                    And your dad?

                                MAX

                          (HESITANT)
                    My dad? He's . . . a liar.

          

                                  MS. BERRY
                             (taken aback)

                        A liar? I don't think you
                        mean "a liar."

                                  MAX
                        Well... he wears a suit and
                        goes to court and talks to the
                        judge and--

                                  MS. BERRY

                             (RELIEVED)
                        Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
                        lawyer.

              Max shrugs.

              INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY


          
              FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

                                  FLETCHER
                        A dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

              OUT:

          

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

                    And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

                    As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. Finally,
                    you leap into the man's Lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!

                        like Jerry's taking that job
                        offer in Boston.
          Fletcher turns sincere.

                                  FLETCHER
                        Aud, I am so sorry...

          
          Behind her back, he FLAILS in celebration.    She glances
          back... He stops, whistles innocently.

          Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max.    They get in his
          Explorer.

                          (to Audrey)
                    Yo u gonna be okay? Because if
                    not, we could leave Max with
                    your sister and I could go out
                    with you two, does that appeal
                    to you at all?
          They drive off.

                              FLETCHER
                    Wave to the soon-to-be ex-
                    boyfriend, Max.

          On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP,
          a dweebish bore.

                                PHILIP
                    Fletcher!

                              PHILIP
                    And this must be Max!

                             FLETCHER
                        (trying to brush
                         him off)
                 . Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was
                   good seeing you--
          Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.

                                PHILIP
                    You know, Ethel and I had a
                    blast at our last little get-
                    together.

                                FLETCHER
                    Oh, me too. I can never get
                    enough of charades. We'll
                    have to do it again sometime.
          Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
          door's closing impededby Philip's foot.

                                PHILIP
                    When?

                                FLETCHER
                    Soon.
          The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.

                             PHILIP
                   How 'bout tonight?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    Not that soon. I'm taking Max
                    to see wrestling--

                              PHILIP
                    We love wrestling.     We could--

                              FLETCHER
                    I don't think so. See, Max is
                    really shy around strangers.
          Max looks up at Fletcher.    He isn't.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Tell you what -- give me your
                    card as a reminder. I'll call

                              JANE
                    I don't know who sent it. But
                    it's for Mr. Allan. It's his
                    anniversary.

                    Yep...
          Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket,
          scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there

                              MAX
                    What are you doing?

                    I can't do it.

                              M IRANDA
                    Fred, it's your duty to
                    present the strongest case
                    possible.

                              FRED
                    The strongest case possible,
                    consistent with the truth.

                              MIRANDA
                   Let the Judge decide what's
                   true. That's what he gets
                   paid for. You get paid to
                   win.

                              FRED
                   If you insist on my taking it
                   to trial, I'll represent Mrs.
                   Cole aggressively and
                   ethically. But, Miranda -- I
                   won't lie.
          Miranda looks out her window, calculating.

                              MIRANDA
                   Then we'll just have to find
                   someone who'will.

          Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out
          GREETINGS to his colleagues.

                    Hey, Pete! Great tie!        ·.
          Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.

                              FLETCHER
                    Thomas--looks like you're
                    losin' weight.
          THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's
          corpulent.

                              THOMAS
                    Gained three pounds.

                    something wonderful.
          Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
          turns to him.     .

                              MAX
                    Yeah?

                    We'll be leaving in a second.

          
          Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind
          him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Damn!   I completely forgot.

          She holds up another, smaller package.

                    Miranda! I didn't see you.
                    Hey, you look lovely, today.
                    Here, I bought you a gift.

          
          He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda.

                              MIRANDA
                    Thanks. I heard about your
                    victory today. You're making
                    quite an impression on the
                    partnership committee.

                    It's like a full measure.
                    Well, anyway, I've got a

          INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - EVENING

          A sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa. His heart sinks
          further when Fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of
          documents.

                              MAX
                    We're not going, are we?

                              FLETCHER
                    Of course we are. A promise
                    i s a promise. We are gonna
                    see wrestling or my name isn't

                           UP)
                    We are having some fun, eh

          PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.

          ·INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting.   She notices
          Jerry pacing.

                              AUDREY
                    Are you alright?

                                  JERRY

                    are you gonna be on the phone?

                                  AUDREY
                    I just wanted to say good-
                    night to Max, but he must
                    still be out with Fletcher,
                         (hangs up)

                              JERRY

                         (SUDDENLY)
                    Will you marry me?
          She's SHOCKED.

                           (NERVOUS)
                    I proposed, I . . . Look, I know
                    this Boston thing is a great
                    opportunity, good job,
                    mo ney .. . everything. But I
                    started to think about being
                    three thousand miles away from
                    you and Max. And I didn't
                    like it. I-- Look, I know
                    it's a lot to ask, to move and
                    everything, but I . . . . I love

          
                    you. I love your son.   Will
                    you marry me?
          She stares at him, excited, but nervous.

          EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Early morning outside Fletcher's building.

          INT. FLETCHER'S STUDY - MORNING

          Fletcher types on his computer.   He's been up all night.
          He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees
          Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES.

                              FLETCHER
                    Max Factor... Happy birthday.
                    How old are you today?

                    Five.

                              FLETCHER
                   Well, you've held up well. I
                   only wish there was some way
                   to commemorate such an
                   occasion, some small symbol to
                   mark this day, like....
          Fletcher produces --

                               FLETCHER
                    . . . A present! .

          
          Max eyes it with wonder.

                             MAX
                   What is it?

                              FLETCHER
                         (no idea)
                   It's... it's.
                         (it hits him)
                   a surprise.
          Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
          box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and

          FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM.

                             MAX

                       Tonight. After your party,
                       you have my word on it.
          Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.

          EXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING

          Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of
          airline tickets.

                                 AUDR EY
                            (re: tickets)
                       Jerry, these are for tomorrow.

                                 JERRY
                       The company wants me to get
                       started right away.

                                 AUDREY
                   I can't just pick up and move
                   to Boston with two days
                   notice.

                              JERRY
                   Ju st come check it out. You
                   a nd Max, see the town. Let's
                 . pick out a place together.
                   Then, if you want to turn me
                   down and scar me for life,
                   fine.

                                 AUDREY
                   It's just not that simple...
                   What about my job? I've been
                   at UCLA three years.

                                 JERRY
                   It's New England. They're
                   lousy with colleges. You
                   can't swing a bat back there
                   without hitting a college.

          
                    You'd get a job there in a
                    second.

                              AUDREY
                    There are other factors
                    involved.

          They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
          and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.
          As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.

                              AUDREY
                    Did you have fun? How were
                    the wrestling matches?

                              FLETCHER
                    Big fun. Manly fun. Am I
                    right, Maxie?

                              MAX

                          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
                    It was fun..

                                                                    ·

                    So how were the wrestling
                    matches ? Did you have fun?

                              JERRY
                    Max , my man! My happy
                    birthday man!
          Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max
          a light punch on the arm.

                              JERRY
                    One-two-three-four-five... and
                    one for good luck.

                              FLETCHER
                    Did you see that? He struck
                    the child!

                              MAX
                    Look what dad got me!
                         (shows the glove)

                              JERRY
                   Whoa! Great! I have my glove
                   in the car. We'll stop in the
                   park on the way home and play

                          (to Fletcher)
                    Great birthday present, dad!
          Fletcher hates him.    Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.

                              VIRGINIA
                   Seven single acts of
                   indiscretion.

                               FLETCHER
                   --Seven acts of indiscretion,
                   only one of which he has any
                   evidence of, and all of which
                   he himself is responsible, for.

                              VIRGINIA
                   He is?

          

                     FLETCHER
          Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all
          night last night studying your
          c ase. Not just your case...
          b ut you. And, by now, I feel
          I know you. You are the
          victim here. The wife of a
          cold, distant businessman.
          Starved for affection, driven
          into the arms of another man--

                     VIRGINIA
          Seven.

                     FLETCHER
                (not missing a

                 BEAT)
          --Seven .other men. You're not
          trying to deny him what is
          r ig htf ull y his. All you're
          insisting on is what is
          r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe
          an idgy-smidgy bit more. I
          think you're bending over
          backwards.

                     VIRGINIA
          Well, I did agree to give him
          j oint custody of the kids...
                (to Miranda)
          He's always been a good
          father.

                     FLETCHER
          And you've always been a good
          wife.

                       VIRGINIA
                  (getting worked

                   UP)
          Yeah. . .

                     FLETCHER
          There's such a thing as being
          t oo nice. That's why you need
          aggr essive representation. To
          show the court that there is
          more than one side to this
          st ory. All I'm asking is the
          opportunity to see that
          justice is done on your
          behalf.
                (takes her hand)
          Will you give me that
          opportunity?

          
          He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Yes! I ' m tired of getting
                    kicked around.

                              FLETCHER
                    Good for you!

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so
                    grateful I have an attorney I
                    can trust.
          S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a
          farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.
          Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
          She moves in on him.

                                 MIRANDA
                    You're good. You're really
                    good.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Oh, pshaw.
                         (pronounces it
                          with the "p")
          She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.

                                 MIRANDA
                   N o, I mean it. The Cole case
                   is worth a truckload of money
                   to this firm, not to mention
                   the press it's going to
                   g en er at e . You win this case
                   and I guarantee you'll make
                   partner.

                           (STRAIGHTENING
                            his tie)
                   Actually, how would you like
                   to make a partner right now?

                                 FLETCHER
                    Excuse me?
          She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.

          INT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          
          A PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a
          MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up.

          

                               CLOWN

                          (SINGING)
                    Captain Fuzzy is my name,
                    Making children happy is my
                    game,
                    With a shake and a juggle,
                    And a big belt buckle,
                    You'll all be glad I came. '
          He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to
          HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch.

                                AUDREY
                         (indicating the

                          CLOWN)
                    What do you think?

                                JERRY
                    Well, if you don't hire your
                    brother, who will?

          

                                           .
          She heads into...

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


                                                                   ·

                                JERRY
                    They called me again from
                    B oston. They really want me
                    there tomorrow.

                              AUDREY
                    . . . I can't go to Boston.

                                JERRY
                    How come?

                                AUDREY
                   Max.

                             JERRY
                   He'll love it there.

                              AUDREY
                    It's Fletcher.

                                JERRY
                   Fletcher?

                             AUDREY
                   I can't move Max three
                   thousand miles away from his
                   father.

          

                                JERRY
                     Audrey, I have never said a
                     bad word about your ex --

                                AUDREY
                     I know.

          

                                JERRY
                    But how much responsibility
                    does Fletcher take for Max,
                    now? He'd never come over if
                    you didn't remind him.

                               AUDREY
                    I know. But if they're three
                    thousand miles apart they'll
                    never see each other.
                    Fletcher will never come to
                    Boston and how can I send Max
                    cross-country to him?

                               .JERRY
                    So because your ex-husband is
                    unreliable, we can't-'-

                               AUDREY
                    I know, it's not logical, it's
                    emotional. I'm sorry.
          Pause.

                              JERRY
                    I still want to marry you.

                              AUDREY
                    Are you sure?
          Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper,
          dials.

                               JERRY
                          (into phone)
                   Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry
                   She!ton... I hope I'm not
                   calling too late... Mr.
                   Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have
                   to turn down your offer..'. So
                   am I . . . Well, I've fallen in
                   love with this beautiful woman
                   in L.A. and she doesn't want
                   to leave and I won't leave
                   without her... Well, thank you
                   very much... Yes, good-bye.

          
                            (hangs up)
                      He wasn't there, but that's
                  1   the speech I would've made.
          She smiles and KISSES him.             The PHONE RINGS.   Audrey
          answers.

                                   AUDREY
                      Hello...

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          

                                   A UDREY
                      Fletcher, where are you?
                      We're getting ready to cut the
                      cake.

                                   FLETCHER
                      Urn, actually, something has
                      come up. A problem on a new
                      caaa--                .
          Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.

                                   F LET CHE R
                      A-h-h-h-!

          

                                AUDREY
                      What happened?

                                   FLETCHER
                      Nothing. I just nailed my
                      ·knee into the desk... Listen,
                      I'm really sorry I can't 'make
                      it.

                                AUDREY
                      Max is going to be so
                      disappointed.

                                   FLETCHER
                      I'll make it up to him, I
                      promise. I'll pick him up
                      from school tomorrow, okay?

                                 AUDREY
                      Do you want me to put him on
                      the phone?
          Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.

                                   FLETCHER
                      Ah, no.     I have to go.

          

                                 AUDREY
                    Right.
          ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the
          phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.

          INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to
          a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
          Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

                              AUDREY
                    All right, birthday boy, make
                    a wish.
          Max doesn't respond.

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, honey. It can be
                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    Max, your dad is sorry. He
                    had to work.

                               MAX
                    He said he was coming. He
                    promised.

                               AUDREY
                    Yes, well, he... promises
                    he'll see you tomorrow.
          Max doesn't believe it.     <
          He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In
          VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.

                               MAX (V.O.)
                    I wish, for just one day, Dad
                    couldn't tell a lie.
          He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
          strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

                                                    CUT TO:
          A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--

          

          INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
          To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
          To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
          To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
          Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

                                MIRANDA
                    S o . . . was it good for you?
          Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
          kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
          CLOTHES follow.
          The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
          A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
          broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

          INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING


          
          An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
          regret and wonder he remembers:

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?"

          INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING


          
          Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
          the mirror, mouth foaming.

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?!"

          INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.

          

                               FLETCHER
                         (laughing it off)
                    "I've had better?"
          I t arrives. He steps in.

          INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING

          The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
          beautiful young WOMAN.

                              FLETCHER
                    New in the building?

                              MODEL
                    I just moved in Monday.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ah. Well, you must allow me
                    to give you the grand tour.

                               MODEL

                          (SHE'S

                           INTERESTED)
                    O h? Do you do that for all
                    the new tenants?

                              FLETCHER
                    No. Just the ones I want to
                    bang like a drum.
          Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

          INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
          opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
          out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

          EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

          A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a BEGGAR.

                              BEGGAR
                    Any change, Mister?

                              .FLETCHER
                    Absolutely.
          But he continues walking.

                              BEGGAR
                    Could you spare some?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    Unquestionably.
          Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
          truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

                                BEGGAR
                    Will you?

                                FLETCHER
                    No.

                                BEGGAR
                    How come?

                                FLETCHER
                   Because I resent your
                   p re sen ce. You fill me with an
                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. Further, I don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but I believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
          As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

                                BEGGAR
                   Jerkoff.

          INT. COURTROOM - MORNING


          
          A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

                             VIRGINIA
                   You look like you're having a
                   rough morning.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
          wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
          with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

                              DANA
                   Good morning, Fletcher.

                                FLETCHER
                   Dana.         "

          

                                RICHARD
                    All right, Virginia, how much
                    will it take to put an end to
                    this?

                              FLETCHER
                    Fifty per cent of your estate.
          Richard is SHOCKED.

                                DANA
                    Fifty per cent? With a pre-
                    nup and proof of adultery?
                    What's your case?

                               FLETCHER
                    Our case is simply this. . .
          Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
          GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

                                DANA        .
                    Interesting, though based on
                    your track record, I expected
                    a little more.
          Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
          the brief.

                                FLETCHER   ..
                   Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in
                   writing!
          But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

                                DANA
                    Let go!

                              FLETCHER
                    I'm trying!

          
          He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
          HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.
          At this moment the BAILIFF calls.

                                BAILIFF
                   All rise for the Honorable
                   Judge William Stevens.

          

                              DANA
                    Very funny, Fletcher. You
                    want to play hardball, I'm
                    game.
          JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.

          

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Calling case BA 09395, Richard
                    Cole versus Virginia Cole.
                    How're we doing this morning,
                    counsel?

                              DANA
                    Fine, thank you.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   And you, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm a little upset about
                    a bad sexual episode I had
                    last night--
          Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
          he just said. After an awkward silence--

                              JUDGE STEVENS

                         (DRYLY)
                   Well, you're still young.
                   It'll happen more and more.
                   In the meantime, what do you
                   say we get. down to business?
                   First, Mr. Reid, I see that
                   your client was previously
                   represented by Mr. Rand of
                   your office.

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you're seeking to
                    substitute in as counsel?

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   Fine , fine. And for the
                   record, the reason is?

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Mr. Rand had severe ethical
                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you don't share the
                    same ethical objections, Mr.
                    Reid?

                                 FLETCHER
                    I have lower standards, Your
                    Honor.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, I'll allow it. Is
                    that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
          Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
          unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

                                 VIRGINIA

                            (UNSURE)
                    Yes?

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    Fine.

                             VIRGINIA
                        (aside, to

                         FLETCHER)
                   What are you doing?

                                 FLETCHER

                            (WORRIED)

                                                                       .
                   I don't know.
                         (to judge, with

                          SOME

                          DESPERATION)
                   Your Honor, I ' d like a
                   continuance!

                             JUDGE STEVENS "
                   This case has already been
                   delayed several times, Mr.
                   Reid.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    I realize that, Your Honor,
                    but I ' d really, really, really
                    like a continuance.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    I'll have to hear good cause,
                    counselor. What's the
                    problem?

          FLETCHER'S P.O.V.

          
          The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
          faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

          FLETCHER'S FACE

                              FLETCHER
                    I can't lie!

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (IMPATIENT)
                   Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
                   still waiting for the good
                   caus e. Now, do you have it or
                 . not?

                    '            FLETCHER

                            (TRUTHFUL)
                    Not.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Motion for a continuance
                    denied. Is there any chance
                    of a settlement in this case?

                                DANA
                    I don't think so, Your Honor.
                    Mr. Reid made it abundantly
                    clear that the last thing in
                    the world he wanted was to --

                               FLETCHER

                          (DESPERATE)

                    SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
          Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    There appears to have been a
                    change in strategy. Let's go
                    to my chambers and negotiate.
          He BANGS the gavel.

          

          INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING

          Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

                             DANA
                   Your Honor, under the terms of
                   the prenuptual agreement, if
                   Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   We have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
                   Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   It certainly does.

                             DANA
                   However, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. Against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, Mr. Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   Fantastically fair.
                   Phenominally fair. In fact,
                   I'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   What are you suggesting, Mr.
                   Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith
                   in her position?

                             FLETCHER
                        (utterly sincere)
                   No, not at all. She's got my
                   client dead to rights. When

          
                    attorneys go to sleep at
                    night, they dream of having a
                    case as strong as hers.

                              DANA
                    Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
                    right, I admit it -- I've seen
                    you make even the lamest case
                    fly. But this time I have
                    you. Even Clarence Darrow

          She brandishes the audiotape.

                              JUDGE SAMIOAN
                    Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
                    dynamite explanation, I'd say
                    you're dead in the water.
                    How's you client's story?

                              FLETCHER

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Strong corroborating evidence?

                              FLETCHER
                    We have evidence that you are
                    not going to-believe.
          Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    You're pretty confident how
                    this trial is going to come
                    out, eh, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                         (hopeless) .
                    "Confident" is too weak a
                    word, Your Honor. I am
                    certain what will happen if I
                    take this puppy to trial. The
                    verdict will be a stunning,
                    humiliating defeat that will
                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.
          Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana
          thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.

          

                                DANA
                      All right! Double the offer!

          She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                      You are some negotiator, Mr.
                      Reid. If your client has half
                      a brain, she'll jump at the
                      offer.

                    understand, I--
          But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
                    settlement?
          Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
          He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

                               JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                   Th ere' s no settlement. Trial

          He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.

          INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes
          toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He
          tries to avoid her, but...

                             JANE
                   What do you think?

          The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.

          He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

                    Aha!
          He holds up a BLUE PEN.

          S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His
          feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He
          finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote

          INADVERTENTLY:

          FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in
          the air.

          Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment --
          then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.

                   It's true... I really do want
                   to see Max, today.
          Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

                   How about that. I really do.

                   Yes, but-this time it's
                   different.

                            AUDREY
                   I see. And how is that?

                   But last night you weren't?

                   No.

                   It must have been with someone
                   very "special."

                             FLETCHER
                   No. It was with someone I
                   don't even like. But I
                   thought it would help my
                   career and at the moment that

               INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR

          

                    AUDREY
          Hello.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, let me explain.
          Something has happened to me--

                    AUDREY
          Fletcher, something else is
          about to happen to you.

                    FLETCHER.
          What do you mean?

                    AUDREY
          Max and I are moving to
          Boston.

                    FLETCHER
          What?!

                    AUDREY
          Jerry asked me to marry him.
          He wants Max and I to fly with
          him this weekend to pick out a
          house. And I'm going to go.
          God knows I don't have any
          reason to stay here.

                    FLETCHER
               (panicking)    .
          Wait, you can't move! If you
          take Max away... I'll
          practically never see him.

                    AUDREY
          Well then you'll have pretty
          much the same relationship you
          have with him now.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, please.... Is this
          because of what I just said on
          the phone?

                    AUDREY
          That was the straw and this is
          the camel's back saying
          goodbye.

                    FLETCHER
          Where are you?

                    AUDREY
          Heading home.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    When you gee there, stay
                    there. I'll be right over.
                    We have to talk.

          He hangs up and heads for the door.      It opens and Miranda
          enters.

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Aaaah!

                   Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher,
                   Fletcher. I must confess--
                   after last night's incident, I
                   was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   But then I thought, "No,
                   that 's not fair. Fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                         (STRAIGHTENING
                          his tie)
                   "It was just some massive,
                   boneheaded misunderstanding,
                   and Fletcher is very, very
                   sorry."
          Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                    Isn't that right, Fletcher?

                             FLETCHER
                        (in agony)
                   Uh -- not really, no.

                              MIRANDA
                          (stunned, angry)
                   N o ? No?! What are you
                   sayi ng? Have you no respect
                   for me?!

          

                               FLETCHER
                    None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d
                    like to respect you, and if it
                    weren't for your mistreatment
                    of the associates, your
                    rudeness to the staff, and the
                    fact that your work sucks, I
                    would.

                              M IRANDA
                    But -- what about last night?

                               FLETCHER
                    I was afraid you wouldn't
                    support my partnership if I
                    turned you down. Plus, I have
                    an immature need for sexual
                    conquests.

                    Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
          He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
          almost hits an OLD MAN.

                              FLETCHER
                    The color of the pen is --
                    re d !      .
          But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
          to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
          truck. The DRIVER screams:

                              DRIVER
                    What's your problem, schmuck?!

                                FLETCHER

                    I ' m an inconsiderate prick!

          
            Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

                                FLETCHER (CON "ID)
                      C'mon, you can do this! The
                      color of the pen is -- RED!
           This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
           POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.

                                  FLETC HER

                     Depends on how long you were

                     Here goes -- I didn't fasten
                     my seatbelt, I didn't glance
                     in my rearview mirror, I
                     didn't signal when I pulled
                     away from the curb, I sped, I
                     followed too closely, I ran a
                     stop sign, I almost hit :a

                    failed to yield at a
                    crosswalk, I changed lanes in
                    the intersection, I changed
                    lanes without signalling, and
                    I changed lanes in the

                    signalling while running a red
                    light and speeding.

                   May I see your driver's

                    Do you think I'm an idiot?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes -- but that's beside the
                    point! My license actually is
                    in my other pants, and they
                    actually were hanging from a
                    credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
                    you! I mean, I would if I
                    could, but I can't!

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    I see. So you ..have no reason
                    to try and hide your license
                    from me?

                              FLETCHER
                   I didn't say that. I have
                   other reasons. Seventeen
                   reasons, to be precise.

                    tell me to wait here because
                    you'll be right over and --
                    here's the crazy part -- I
                    actually wait.

                              FLETCHER
                    I can explain--

                              AUDREY
                    I missed a department meeting.
                    I. . . Did you come in a cab?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes.

                              AUDREY
                    Where's your car?

          EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING

          
          Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins
          Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

                              FLETCHER
                    Thank you. . I can't tell you
                    how much this means to me.

                              AUDREY
                    I can. One thousand, six
                    hundred, and fifty-four
                    dollars and eleven cents.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ow.

          
          At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a
          TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.
          parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You scratched my car!

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    Where?     .

                              FLETCHER
                   Right there!

          

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    Oh that? That was already
                    there.

                                 FLETCHER

                            (OUTRAGED)
                    Why, you -- you liar! Do you
                    know what I ' m going to do
                    about this?

                                TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                         (angrier and

                          ANGRIER)
                    ...Nothing! Because if I take
                   you to small-claims court, it
                   will just drain eight hours
                   out of my life, and you
                   probably won't show up, and if
                   I finally got the judgment
                   you'd just stiff me anyway, so
                   what I'm gonna do is piss and
                   moan like an impotent jerk and
                 . then bend over and take it up
                   the tail pipe!

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    You've been here before,
                    haven't you?
          He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.

                                AUDREY
                    Well I can't remember when
                    I've had more fun, now if
                    you'll excuse me, I have a
                    class.
          She starts out.

                                FLETCHER
                    Audrey, wait. I want to talk
                    to you about this Boston
                    situation.

                             . AUDREY
                    What do you want to say?

                                FLETCHER
                   You can't go. It's not fair.
                   Taking Max three thousand
                   miles away is not fair.

          

                              AUDREY
                    Let' s define "fair." Last
                  · night a five-year old boy was
                    crushed because his father
                    lied to him about coming to
                    his birthday party. Fair?

                              FLETCHER
                    Last night--

                             AUDREY
                   -- Was none of my business.
                   When it happened two years ago
                   it was my business, but now I
                   don't have to care anymore.
                   See, that's the magic of
                   div orce . But it does matter
                   to Max. Everything you do
                   matters to him... and
                   everything you don't do.

                              FLETCHER
                   All right-- now let me tell
                   you something...you're
                   absolutely right. I'm guilty
                   of all charges. I'm throwing
                   myself on the mercy of your
                   -court.
          Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very
          sincere, but she can't trust him.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                   I have an idea. I'll come
                   over tonight, right after
                   court lets out and play with
                   M ax. Have him invite some
                   fri ends over. We'll have a
                   game and everything. Then,
                   you and I can sit down and
                   talk.

                             AUDREY
                   We're suppose to be on a plane

                   TONIGHT--

                             FLETCHER
                   No, Audrey. Just talk to me
                   abou t this first. Please.
                   Au drey, I've lost you. Don't
                   make me lose Max, too.

                             AUDREY
                   You're really coming?

          

                              FLETCHER
                    This is iron-clad. This is
                    the mother of all promises.
                    What time?

                              AUDREY
                    ...Six?

                              FLETCHER
                    Ten-to-six.

                               AU DR EY

                          (UNSURE)
                    All right... only if I tell
                    Max you're coming and you
                    don't show up and I have to
                    see that look on Max's face --
                    that heartbreaking look-- it's
                    Boston, Fletcher.

                              FLETCHER.
                    I will be there.

          
          As Audrey gets in her car -- .

                              AUDREY
                   I hope so. Do you know what
                   your son was doing at nine-
                   fif teen las t ni ght? He was
                   making a wish on his birthday
                   c ake. He was wishing that,
                   for just one day, his dad
                   couldn't tell a lie.
          She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
          when a new thought strikes him.

                              FLETCHER
                   Oh my God! That-'s it! An
                   innocent kid - - a heartfelt
                   plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,
                   it' s impossible --but it
                   'makes sense!..! If he can wish
                   it, he can unwish it!

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY


          
          Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his
          arm.

          INT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS

          Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max
          brightens.

          

                               MAX
                    Dad!

          

                               MS . BERRY
                    Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.
                    Berry, Max's teacher!

                               FLETCHER
                    Hi. Listen, I need to talk to

                    MAX--

                               MS. BERRY
                    Mr. Reid, we were just talking
                    ab ou t careers. You're a

                                FLETCHER

                           (WARY)
                    Yes.

                              MAX
                    Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful
                    for the children to hear
                    something positive about
                    lawyers!

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, actually-- ·

                    Children! .Mr. Reid is going
                    to tell us what it's like to
                    be a lawyer.
          She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center
          s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.

                               FLETCHER
                    Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and
                    I work at a big law firm with
                    a lot of other lawyers and I
                    do stuff in a law court.
                    Thank you.
          He starts out.

                               MS. BERRY
                    One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe
                    some of the children have

                    What kind of lawyer are you?

                              FLETCHER
                    It means if you're daddy left
                    your mommy, he'd call me.

                              CRAIG

                    youth as his body gives way to

                    Dadzilla. You came to play
                    catch?

                    No. I ' d like to, but I can't
                    right now.
          Max is disappointed again.

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I ' m sorry I missed your party
                    la st night. How was your

                    Stupid. His big nose and

                              FLETCHER
                    That's why he should have worn
                    make-up.
          Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
          Max doesn't laugh.

                      '       MAX .
                    I want to play kickball with

                    told me about... the wish you
                    made last night. It came
                    true.
          Max is amazed.

                              MAX
                    Really? You mean you have to
                    tell the truth?

                    Yes.

          

                             MAX
                   No matter what?

                             FLETCHER
                   No matter what.

          
          Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.

                              MAX
                    Is wrestling real?

                              FLETCHER
                    In the Olympics, yes.      On    .
                    Channel 23, no.

                              MAX
                    Will sitting close to the TV
                    set make me go blind?

                               FLETCHER
                    Not in a million years.

                               MAX
                    If I keep making this face--
                         (makes a horrible

                          FACE)
                    will it get stuck that way?

                               FLETCHER
                    Uh-uh.

                               MAX
                   .If I go in the water right
                   after lunch, will I drown?

                               FLETCHER
                    Only if you can't 'swim.

                              MAX
                    Why do I have to eat squash?

                               FLETCHER
                    Because your mom buys it.

                             MAX
                   How come you're always too
                   busy to play with me?
          The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
          awful.

                               FLETCHER
                   I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,
                   you know I'm coming over
                   to nig ht. We're gonna play
                   together.

                               MAX
                   Baseball?

          

                                FLETCHER
                  . Yes! This is absolutely an
                    A-number one promise. You and
                    I -- tonight -- baseball.
          Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.

                                FLETCHER
                      Now, listen, Max, I need a
                      favor from you. I ' m in a
                      little trouble today. I need
                      you to take that wish back.

                                MAX
                      So you can lie?

                                FLETCHER
                      Not to you.

                                MAX
                      To who?

                                FLETCHER
                      Max, sometimes grownups...
                      need to lie. It's hard to
                      explain, but i f . . . Look,
                      here's an example. When Mommy
                      was pregnant with you, she
                      gained a little weight.
                      Se venty pounds. I thought she
                      was gonna give birth to a car.
                      But she'd say to me "How do I
                      lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,
                      honey, you're beautiful,
                      you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I
                      would've hurt Mommy's
                      fee ling s. Understand?
          Max nods.

                                MAX
                      You didn't think she was
                      beautiful.

                                FLETCHER
                      Right. No... Max, I don't
                      know how to get along in the
                      grown-up world if I have to
                      stick to the truth. I could
                      lose my case, I could lose my
                      promotion, I could even lose,
                      my job... Do you understand?
          Max shakes his head "no."

          

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Will you help me anyway?
          A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      That's my boy!
          Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He
          takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on
          himself.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Now, do whatever you did last
                      night... only this time, make
                      an un-wish.
          Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
          takes a breath-- and blows them out.

                                MAX
                      I did it. ^

                                FLETCHER
                      Great! Great! Now to test --

                                                                   ·

          
          Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher
          hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she

          SLAPS HIM.
          Fletcher returns to his son.

                                MAX
                      Did it work?

                      Not like I ' d hoped. Did you
                      really unwish it?
          Max nods.

                                   MAX
                      Only...

                                   FLETCHER
                      Only what?

                                   MAX
                      Yesterday, when I wished it, I
                      r ea lly meant it. This time
                      when I unwished it I only did
                      it 'cause you told me to.

          

                                FLETCHER
                         (losing patience)
                    Well, then do it again.        Only
                    this time, mean it.

                                MAX
                    I can't.

                                FLETCHER
                    Why not?!

                                MAX
                    Because I don't want you to
                    lie.

                                FLETCHER
                    I explained this to you! I
                    have to lie. Everybody lies!
                    Mommy lies, even the wonderful
                    Jerry lies--

                                        '

                                MAX

                    makes me feel bad.

          Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.

                    I am coming over, tonight,
                    Max. You believe me, don't
                    you?
          Max hesitates, then nods.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I'll see you tonight, buddy...
                    That's a promise.
          Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks
          at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.

          EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY


          
          A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his
          office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.

          

                              MACHO ATTORNEY
                    Yo, Fletcher! How's it
                    hanging?

                               FLETCHER
                    Short and shrivelled.
          Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He
          shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him
          anyway.

                               PHILIP
                    Fletcher! I'm still waiting
                    for your call. I guess you
                    must've lost my card --

                               FLETCHER

                    don't you swing by my place
                    around seven-thirty!
          Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him
          resolutely.

                              FLETCHER
                    Philip... I don't want to come
                    over to your house!
          A long moment, then --

                               PHILIP
                   Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's
                   this new karaoke bar I've been
                   dying to try. I'll pick you
                   up at your office! Seven-
                   thirty! !
          And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.

          Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives
          him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.

                   Do you want your messages?

                   No.
          He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows
          him in, leaving his door open.

          Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.

                             GRETA
                   Are you okay?

                             FLETCHER
                   My son hates me.

                                GRETA
                   No! He loves you. I've seen
                   y ou together. You're his
                   hero.

                                FLETCHER
                   O h yeah? Last night at his
                   birthday party, he made a
                   ·wish. That I wouldn't be able
                   to tell a lie for one whole
                   day.

                   It came true.

                   What?

                                FLETCHER
                   It's true. Didn't it seem odd
                   to you that I kept telling the
                   truth all morning?

                             GRETA
                   Well, yeah, but...

                    You're telling me that you

                              FLETCHER
                    That's right!     I am incapable
                    of lying.

                         (QUICKLY)
                    Forget it. Let's not do this.

                              GRETA
                   -- and the firm wouldn't.give
                   me one. And I asked you if
                   you would give it to me out of
                   your own pocket and you said
                   the company wouldn't permit it
                   because it creates jealousy
                   among the other secretaries?
                   Was that true or did you just
                   not want to pony up the dough?

          Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes.
          She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very
          harras,sed.

                    Hello... Mom!!
          The phone flies into the air. He catches it.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                    Mom... Well, I wasn't actually
                    on vacation... Because I
                    didn't want to talk to you...
                    Because you insist on talking
                    to me about Dad's bowel
                    movements -- size, color,
                    frequency... I'll call you
                    later... No, not really.
          He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Oh dammit! I cut him off! I
                    cut off the Judge! Greta...
          He falls to his knees.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I'm on my knees in a nine
                    hundred dollar suit. Don't
                    leave.
          Greta stops.     She seems to consider.

                                 GRETA
                    A few years ago a friend of
                    mine had a burglar up on her
                    roof.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Yes?

                   A burglar. -He fell through
                   the kitchen skylight and
                   landed on a cutting board on a
                   butcher's knife, cutting his
                   l e g. He sued my friend. The

          
                    burglar sued my friend.
                    Thanks to guys like you-- he
                    won. My friend had to pay him
                    six thousand dollars. Is that
                    justice?

                               FLETCHER
                    No. . . but what' s your poijit!

                               GRETA
                    My point is, it's hard to get
                    justice. But this is justice,

          She leaves.   Fletcher starts to give chase...

                                 FLETCHER

                    GRETA--
          He runs directly into Miranda.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Aaaah!
          Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump
                    i nto you. Are you busy?

                                 FLETCHER
                    Extremely.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Good. Would you follow me,
                    please?
          Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.

                               MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   Fletcher, did you know that
                   the partnership committee is
                   being headed up by Mr. Allan
                   himself?
                         (off his wary

                          NOD)
                   Say, you used to work directly
                   for Mr. Allan, didn't you?
                        (off his waried

                          NOD)
                   Tell me, what do you think of
                   him?

          

                              FLETCHER

                         (HELPLESS)
                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.

                              MIRANDA

                         (GRINNING)
                    How delightful!
          She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,
          the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.

                              MIRANDA
                    Pardon me for interrupting
                    your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you
                    remember Fletcher Reid.

                                                                       ·

                   ·It's good to see you again,
                   Fletcher. '.
          An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.

                              MIRANDA
                    Oh, that's right. You used to
                    work together. .Tell me, what
                    do you think of Mr. Allah?
          Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
          trying to hold it back, but--

                              MIRANDA
                    I said... What do you think of
                    Mr. Allan?

                              FLETCHER     .
                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.
          DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
          LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who
          looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.

          

                                 MR. ALLAN
                    Marvelous! Marvelous! That's
                    what I love most about this
                    firm-- the collegial
                    atmosphere, the hearty good-
                    fellowship!
          Miranda is incensed.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    And thanks for those flowers
                    for my anniversary. My wife
                    loved them.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm due in court... bye-
                    bye.

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a
          sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   .

          INT. COURTROOM


          
          CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands
          are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other
          table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.

                                BAILIFF
                    All rise.
          They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                   Counselors, are we ready to
                   begin?

                               FLETCHER
                          (eagerly and a
                           little too

                   N o sir! We are not ready to
                   b eg in. My client has not
                   arrived.
          The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN
          and a NANNY.

                               FLETCHER      ·   .
                    --   until now.

          
          He collapses into his chair.

          
                          (to Falk, with

                           DETERMINATION)
                    Did you and Mrs. Cole ever

                    fu-- Fu!
          He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Wate r! Get him water!
          Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.

                                FLETCHER
                    Fu-- fu--

                          (slaps him on the

                          BACK)
                    Try to relax! Breathe deeply!
          Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who
          downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING
          in PAIN. -

                               VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                   W hat?!   What?!

          

                                FALK
                    I couldn't find any water, so
                    I got him coffee!
          Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
          h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.

                             BAILIFF
                   Judge is taking the bench.
          Fletcher's expression turns to terror.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on
          from the gallery.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .
          Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice
          quaking with fear...

          

                              VIRGINIA
                    Sorry. One of the kids threw
                    up in the car.
          Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
          sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

                    sorry for them already.
          The judge BANGS the gavel.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Ms. Appleton, you may begin.

          from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.

                              BRYSON
                         (referring to his

                          NOTES)
                    -- From March six through June
                    twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole
                    at the behest of Mr. Cole.
                    During that period, I noted
                    that Mr. Cole left each day
                    between seven-forty and seven-
                    fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
                    would frequently have a male
                    visitor arrive and stay for
                    one to four hours. I was able
                    to take several photographs of
                    the male visitor.
          He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A

                              DANA
                    I see. And do you .know what
                    Mrs. Cole and her male visitor

          
                    did during their frequent...
                    visits?

                              BRYSON
                    Well, they were pretty good
                    about keeping the shades drawn
                    -- but I sure was able to
                    hear. I made an audiotape of
                    one such., "session."
          H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.

                              DANA
                    With the Court's permission, I
                    would like to play the tape.

                              FLETCHER
                    Your Honor, I object!

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    And why is that, Mr. Reid?

                               FLETCHER
                          (can't help

                           HIMSELF)
                    Because it's devastating to my
                   ·case.
          The judge is startled by his candor.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Overruled..
          As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously

          DOWNS THE GLASS.
          Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the
          thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged
          in intense physical activity.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    So , what did you say? You
                    ready?

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Oh boy am I ready.

                             MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                   Good. Let me help you off
                   with that. Come on, lie down.

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                   Wai t a minute. Do you have
                   protection?

          

                               MALE VISITOR ( O . S . )
                    Right here. Okay, now I ' m
                    gonna show you something new.

                               VIRGINIA ( O . S . )
                    Oh, I've never done it like
                    this before.                    .·.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    Don't worry, you can take it.
                    Oh yeah. That's it. There
                    you go. Yes! Yes!
          WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Yes, yes, yes --
          As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
          more labored breathing, building intensity and --

                               MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah, bring it on .home --
                    yes! Yes! Yes!

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Yes! YES! YES!
          The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still
          moment. . .
          As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
          nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the
          tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.

                              DANA
                    Your witness.

                               FLETCHER
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    No questions? .

                              VIRGINIA
                    No questions?

                                FLETCHER
                          (afraid to ask

                           ANY)
                    No questions.

                    Petitioner rests.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    All right, Mr. Reid. You may
                    proceed.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    How?!
          Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
          water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...
          when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.
          After a momement, he grins.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Would the Court be willing to
                    grant me a short bathroom
                    break?

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    It can't wait?

                              FLETCHER
                    Not unless you want to mop up.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (FRUSTRATED)
                    All right, but get back in
                    here immediately so .we can
                    finish this.
          Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.

          INT. REST ROOM - DAY

          Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
          i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.
          It's only 4:15. '

                                FLETCHER
                    What did I think? That I
                    could piss for forty-five
                    minutes?!
          He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
          He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE
          WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally
          KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.
          A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

                              MAN
                    What's going on in-there?

          

                                FLETCHER (O . S . )
                    I ' m abusing myself! Do you
                    mind?!
          The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the
          severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.

                              BAILIFF
                    I found him like this in the
                    bathroom. Somebody beat the
                    hell out of him.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Who did this?

                               FLETCHER

                          (TRUTHFULLY)
                    A madman, Your Honor.. A
                    desperate fool at the end of
                    his pitiful.rope.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   -What did he look like?

                              FLETCHER

                         (DESCRIBING

                          HIMSELF)
                    About five eleven, hundred
                    eighty-five pounds, crazed
                    look in his eye.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    Bailiff, have the deputies
                    search the building.
          A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.

                             JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                   Under the circumstances, I
                   have no choice but to recess
                   this case until tomorrow
                   morning at nine.
          Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --

                              JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    -- Unless, of course, you
                    think you can still proceed?
          Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
          answering, but he can't repress the truth.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    Can you?

                               FLETCHER
                    Yes, I can.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Splendid. I admire your
                    courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give
                    you a few minutes to compose
                    yourself, and then we'll get
                    started.
          Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

          Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. PHONE

          RINGS.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Hello.

          INTERCUT WITH MAX AT HOME. AUDREY IS THERE.

                                 MAX
                    Dad...

                              FLETCHER
                         (summoning up

                          ENTHUSIASM)
                    Maxi-pad. How's it going?

                                 MAX
                    Great. You know Paul and
                    Emanuel from across the
                    street?

                                 FLETCHER
                    The twins.

                                MAX .

                           (EXCITEDLY)
                   Well, they never want to play
                   baseball with me, but I told
                   them I was gonna play tonight
                   with my Dad, so now they want
                   to play with us. Is it okay?

                                 FLETCHER
                   Sure.

          

                               MAX
                    Oh boy. We're setting up a
                    whole field in the yard.
                    Where we buried Petey the
                    hamster is second base.
                         (Fletcher sighs)
                    You're still coming right?'

                               FLETCHER
                          (sees Virginia

                           APPROACHING)
                    I'11 be there. I gotta go
                    now, Max. I'll see you in two
                    hours.
          Max hangs up.

                               MAX
                         (to Audrey)
                    He's really coming.
          She smiles, but she's worried. .

          COURTHOUSE STEPS

                                                                    ·

          
          Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Mr. Reid, you remember
                    Laurence Falk, the man from
                    the tape.

                              FALK
                    How are you?

                               FLETCHER
                    I've slipped into the seventh
                    circle of Hell, thank you, and
                    you?
          Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Shouldn't we go over our
                    testimony?

                               FLETCHER
                    Well, basically the plan is I
                    walk you through the tape step
                    by step, I ask you questions--

                               VIRGINIA
                    And we give the explanation
                    you came up with.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Exactly.

          

                                FALK
                    So all we have to do is lie.
                    Sounds simple enough.

                                FLETCHER
                    Do esn't it? And I'll finish
                    up with a dramatic series of
                    questions, something like...
                    "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that
                    you and Mrs. Cole have never
                    made lo--"
          But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The
          others look concerned, but he waves them off.

                              FLETHCER (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,
                    isn't it true that you and
                    Mrs. Cole have never made lo--

                    IO-.H

          
          To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    Oh my God! I can't do it! I
                    can't finish the question if I
                    know the answer is a lie!
          At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.

                                MR. ALLAN
                    Don't let me interrupt,
                    Fletcher. I just want you to
                    know I'll be observing this
                    a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
                    see you in action.
          Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm looking forward to it. Go
                    get 'em!

          
          Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving
          Fletcher more desperate than before.

                                FLETCHER
                   C'mon! Gotta rephrase the
                   question!

               Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...

                                      FLETCHER
                         Mr. Falk, do you know my
                         client, Virginia Cole?

                         Isn't it true that your
                         relationship with my client is
                         entirely platonic, not?
               The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.

          A GASP from the audience. All eyes are on Fletcher.

          A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.

                               JUDGE STEVENS

          Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.

                   attorney had a sudden attack
                   of conscience!
          Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia
          said.

          Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup
          and her passport.

          about her age. It says you
          were born in 1964. What's the
          truth? 1962? '60? How young

                          GAVEL)
                    Q uie t! Let me see-the license
                    and birth certificate.
          All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then:

                                  JUDGE STEVENS
                    In light of this new evidence,
                    the court must rule in favor
                    o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is
                    hereby awarded half of the
                    marital assets -or thirtyrseven
                    million three hundred and
                    ninety-five thousand dollars.
          The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are
          devastated.                    '

                                  MR. ALLAN
                    That son of bitch pulled it
                    off!
          Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously,
          Miranda gives him the finger.

                                  JUDGE STEVENS
                    O r d e r ! Order!! Now i
                    understand both parties have
                    agreed to joint custody. Is
                    that correct?

          

                               FLETCHER AND DANA

                    YES--

                               VIRGINIA
                    No!   I'm contesting custody.

          
          Fletcher freezes.

                               FLETCHER
                    What?

                               VIRGINIA
                         (re: her husband)
                    Payback. For him trying to
                    prevent me from collecting my
                    thirty-seven million.

                               FLETCHER
                    He was entitled to prevent
                    you. You committed adultery.'
                    You only won because you're a
                    liar, remember? .

                               VIRGINIA
                   No. You pointed out that my
                   husband took advantage of a
                   poor underage girl. I was the
                   vic tim here. And now I'm
                   going to hit him where it
                   hurts.

                               FLETCHER
                    But -- but -- you said he was
                    a good father.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   M r. Reid? Do we have an
                   agreement on custody or not?
          Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.

                               FLETCHER
                   No.                                            .

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                   In that case, there will be a
                   custody hearing tomorrow
                   mor ning at nine. Court is
                   adj ourned!
          He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's
          attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her
          kids.

          

                                    VIRGINIA
                          Stop that! We're leaving now!

                                    CHILD
                          I want to go with Daddy.

          V,'

          ,-

           .-
                Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away
                from their tearful father.

                                    MR. COLE
                          Don't worry. I'll see you no
                          matter what. I promise.
                Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.

                                     MR. ALLAN
                                (re: the

                                 COMMOTION)
                          I love kids. They give you so
                          much leverage in a case like
                          this.
                               (pats Fletcher on

                                BACK)
                          Congratulations, partner. how
                          does it feel?
                And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole
                and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a
                sledgehammer!

                                     FLETCHER '
                          Excuse me. Just a second.
                                (to the Judge)
                          Y our Honor? Your Honor?
                          Wait!

                          We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.

                                    FLETCHER

                          wins ?! What are we, nuts?
                Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.

                                     FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                          T his woman --my client --
                          goes down with the frequency
                          of a nuclear submarine and we
                          just gave her thirty seven
                          million dollars because she's
                          a liar! And now as an extra
                          added little bonus, we're
                          going to let her steal, the
                          kids, too?

                   MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop
                   to ask yourself, why do people
                   hate us? Could it be because
                   what we did here today sucks?!
                   We don't care about the truth!

          EXT. AUDREY'S PORCH -'DAY


          
          A sad Max is seated on the steps. TWO other BOYS are there
          with baseball equipment.

          

                               PAUL
                    We're going home.

                              EMMANUEL
                    Yeah, thanks for the great
                    game, Max.
          Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from
          the door. She goes and sits by her son.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, honey. Your dad had a
                    very big case today. It
                    probably just--

                              MAX
                    I don't want to talk about it.

                              AUDREY
                    Okay.

                              MAX

                         (SUDDENLY)
                    I hate dad! I hate him!

                              AUDREY
                    Honey, don^t say that.
          Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The
          look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a
          decision.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, there's something I-want
                    to talk to you about. . .

          INT. JAIL AREA


          
          Fletcher's handcuffed and is led to jail by TWO OFFICERS-.
          There's a happy/crazedness to him now. The truth is
          pouring forth, but he looks way, way off the deep end.

          
                            (desperately,
                             p as si ng a phone)
                      Pho ne call!! Phone call!! I
                      g et to make a phone call!!

          INT. AUDREY'S KITCHEN -- DAY

          Max and Audrey at the table. The airline tickets Jerry
          gave her are in front of them.

                                MAX
                      When would we move?

                                 AUDREY
                      Soon. My semester's almost
                      over. You only have a week
                      left of school... You like
                      Jerry don't you?
                            (he nods)
                      So what do you say, should we
                      check it out? Jerry wants us
                      to come with him tonight. He
                      has to pick out a place to
                      live and he really wants our
                      help?

                                 MAX
                      Could I get a sled for when it
                      snows?

                                AUDREY

                                             ...                       ·

                         (to security

                          GUARD)
                    Son, that man is tresspassing.
          The guard starts toward Fletcher threateningly.

                                FLETCHER
                   Hold it!
                        (to Mr. Allan)
                   I've got ten years worth of
                   dirt on you and this firm, and
                   I'm in the kind of mood today
                   to get a lot off my chest.
                   You let me use the phone or I
                   start talking!!

                                                     CUT TO:
          Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan
          has watched from atop the stairs of the building.

                             MR. ALLAN
                   Still euphoric, Reid?
          He goes back inside.· Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR
          SCREECHES to a HALT, inches away.

          

                               MAN'S VOICE ( O . S . )
                    Fletcher! ·
          It's PHILIP.

                               PHILIP
                    Seven-thirty... It's Karaoke
                    time!
          Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,

                                FLETCHER

                    PHILIP!!   LOOK AT YOU!!! MY

                    PHILIP!!

          
          Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.

          INT. PHILIP'S CAR - DAY

          Philip's driving Fletcher.

                              FLETCHER
                    You're saving my life, Philip.

                              PHILIP
                    You know, it's funny, but for
                    some reason I was beginning to
                    think you didn't like me.
                    Isn't that silly?

                               FLETCHER .
                    No. It's not silly.       I don't
                    like you.

                               PHILIP
                    What?

                               FLETCHER
                   I don't like you. I'm sorry.
                   I find you boring. I hate
                   ch ara des . And you wouldn't
                   know a good time if it sat on
                   your face.
                          (feels bad)
                   I'm sorry. It was easier than
                   telling you how I really felt.
                   Are you upset?
          A moment, then:

                               PHILIP
                   No. To be honest, I don't
                   like you either. You treat
                   people like obstacles and you
                   cheat at charades. .

          

                                FLETCHER
                     Then why are you always trying
                     to socialize with me?

                                PHILIP
                     You're a client. I figured if
                     I didn't try to be your
                     friend, you'd get a new
                     accountant.

                                FLETCHER
                     Philip, I don't like you as a
                     person, but I'm crazy about
                     you as my accountant. I ' d
                     never hire a new accountant.
                     Never!

                               PHILIP
                     So we don't have to like each
                     other anymore?

                               FLETCHER    -
                     Not at all.

                 .              PHILIP
                     All right. Sooner I get you
                     ·to the airport, sooner I can
                     dump your sorry ass off.

          EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY

          Philip's car skids to a stop.    Fletcher jumps out.

          INT. LAX TERMINAL - DAY .


          
          Fletcher races in.

                                FLETCHER
                     Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog,
                     rain, something, anything...
          He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD
                " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17."
          Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!!

          INT. LAX ESCALATOR

          Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past
          people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says

          STAND ON RIGHT.

          

                                 FLETCHER

                   I don't trust you. I don't
                   know what the hell that
                   uniform is. Sorry.

          INT. LAX - SECURITY AREA

          Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector.
          Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM.

                              INSPECTOR
                    Please step through again.

                                FLETCHER
                   Ahhh!! !    Damn..;
          Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex
          into a tray.
          He tries again.     It BUZZES again!

                              FLETCHER
                   What? I'tii practically naked!
          A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.

                    It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...

          
          The wand BEEPS over Fletchers front pocket. He reaches in
          and pulls out the now familiar BLUE PEN...

          

          INT. LAX - DEPARTURE CONCOURSE


          
          Fletcher races by Gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the
          PLANE Slowly TAXIING AWAY.

                                  FL E TC H ER
                    N ooo!!!
          Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT".    Goes for it
          when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.

                              FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Can I help you?

                               FLETCHER
                    Look out!! ! --

                          (TRUTHFUL)

                    -NOTHING'S COMING!!
          The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And
          Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!

          EXT. TARMAC - DAY

          He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane
          which is moving away.
          No way he'll catch it.
          Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT
          (These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets
          an insane idea. . .
          The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
          in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.

                                  WORKER
                    Hey!!      Hey!!!!
          But Fletcher's gone.

          EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY


          
          Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the
          plane. GROUND WORKERS react.
          Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
          Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low
          to see in the plane.
          He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
          the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS

          THE STEPS!

          
          The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.

          INT. AIRPLANE - DAY - MOVING


          
          PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along,
          WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out
          his call for...

          

                                   F LET CH ER

                    MA X ? !!   AUDREYY?!!

          
          A STEWARDESS stands in the aisle, giving the safety
          lecture.

          ·Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.

          EXT. TARMAC - DAY

          Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane
          POINT, STARE in amazement.
          Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO
          THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
          At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.
          He surfs under the wing...
          ...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.
          Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
          spots. . .

          MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD
          Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.
          Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his
          seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.
          Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO

          NOISY.
          Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!

          FLETCHER'S POV
          The RUNWAY is ENDING!.

          
          Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now
          trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.

          

                                    AUDREY
                          (checks under his

                           SEAT)
                     It's right here, honey.

                               AUDREY
                     Just a second, Max.

                               MAX
                     Mom, it's dad!

                               AU DREY
                     W hat? What about dad?
          Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...

                                  AUDREY
                     Fletcher?!

          AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN!
          BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading ·
          right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE

          CART. . -
          And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!

          
          Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A

          MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE!

          CLOSE ON FLETCHER

          
          With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
          in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.

                                                      CUT TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.
          He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.

                                FLETCHER
                           (mumbles to

                            HIMSELF)
                     Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes
                     indeed.

                                DEPUTY

          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a
          shoe, and still holding the compress.

                               FLETCHER

                          (WEAKLY)
                    Greta? Is that you?
          He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY
          waiting for him just outside the door.
          Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.
          He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Audrey and
                          Jerry, trying to
                          seem chipper)
                   Sorry I made you miss your
                   flight, not really.
                         (no response)
                   You're obviously a little
                 . upset, not that I blame you...
                   although I'll bet you'll still
                   get the bonus miles. . .

                              AUDREY
                    Fletcher, are you crazy?
                    What were you doing?

                              FLETC HER
                    That's two questions. A; Yes,
                    but I think the legal term is
                    temporarily insane. And B; I
                    was trying to finally have
                    that talk with you about
                    Boston.
          Audrey's patience are growing thin...

                              FLETCHER
                   Okay, okay... The whole truth
                   and nothing but the truth,
                        (with difficulty,

                         SINCERELY)
                   I tried to stop the plane
                   because it was taking off with
                   my life... you and Max.
          This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher
          said, but the way he said it.

          

                               FLETCHER
                    I know you've met somebody...
                    somebody pretty great... and
                    the truth is I wish you didn't
                    but you did and... All I ' m
                    asking i s . . . Please don't move
                    to Boston. Please don't take
                    Max away.
          She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.

                               AUDREY
                    You can come visit anytime.
                    It's only a four hour flight.

                               FLETCHER
                    I don't want to visit him.
                    That's what I've been doing--
                    visiting him, dropping by,
                    stopping in. I want to be in
                    his life. I don't want to be
                    some jerk that sees him at
                    Easter. I want to be his
                    father.
          Fletcher turns to Jerry.

                               FLETCHER
                   I know I have no right to ask,
                   but can I talk you out of
                   taki ng that job? I can get
                   you a better job here in L.A.
                   I've got all kinds of
                   connect ions... what do you do
                   again?

                              JERRY
                    I design security systems.

                               FLETCHER
                    How symbolic. Okay great.
                    You know Pac-Tec?

                             JERRY
                   The biggest.

                               FLETCHER
                   One of their systems shorted
                   out and burned down a
                   supermarket. I got them off.
                   Another proud day for justice.
                   If I ask them they'll beat
                   your Boston offer in two
                   s ec on ds .    ..

          

                               AUDREY
                    Don't put Jerry in the middle.

                               JERRY
                    It's okay.
                          (to Fletcher)
                    Boston means this
                          (snaps his

                           FINGERS)
                    to me. All I want is for this
                    lady and Max to be happy.
                    Preferably, with me. Whatever
                    they want, I'll go along with.
          They both look to Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    All I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.

                              AUDREY
                    You better know your jury.
                    You're hot exactly Max's hero
                    today.

                              FLETCHER
                    Just let me present my case.
          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

          TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.

                                FLETCHER/TERMINATOR
                    I have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .
                    Argghhh!
                         (no response, a

                          BEAT)
                    You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:

                               FLETCHER
                    You wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more

          
                    important things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    Malfunction in vector one.
                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:

                              MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to Fletcher) ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...

                               FLETCHER
                    Max. .. it's 9:22.

                              AUDREY
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                    Max, you made the wish at
                    9:15. I've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.

                              MAX
                    So then, you were...

                              FLETCHER
                    No! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.

          

                                       MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.

                                   AUDR EY
                     No.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."

                                       MAX
                          (to Fletcher)
                     Can we play catch tomorrow?
          Fletcher smiles. . .

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...

                                       M AX
                     Dad! !

                                       FLETCH ER
                     Ma x i mu m ! !
          Fletcher picks Max up.

                                       MAX
                    Transformer!!! .
          Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...

                                       FLETCHER
                     Malfunction in vector seven.
                     I have lost control of my
                     affection reflex...
          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.

                                       FLETCHER
                     Procreate!          Procreate!

                                   AUDREY

                              (PLAYFULLY)
                     Fletcher... You're gonna lose
                     a limb--

          

                              MAX
                    Come on, dad, let's play
                    catch!!

                              FLETCHER
                    Sr. . .

                    UE
                          (starts to toss

                           MAX)
                    Here you go, mom.
                          (Max screams)
                    Oh, you mean with a ball...
          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.

                              FLETCHER
                    I take back every dirty,
                    dishonest thing I ever said
                    about you, wrote about you,
                    faxed about you, E-mailed
                    about you.

                              JERRY
                    Appreciated.
          Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.

                              FLETCHER
                    So, you up for a little
                    friendly competition?

                             JERRY
                   No, you go play with your son.

                              FLETCHER
                   I wasn't talking about
                   basesball.
          A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to Max.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Max)
                   Alright, it's time to show you
                   the old Fletcher Reid change up.

          
          Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then
          instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.
          Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
          There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.

-----------------------------------------------------------

     (An ocean. Birds are flying and porpoises are swimming happily.
  From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves)

Sailors: I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
  And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho
  Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you
  In mysterious fathoms below.
Eric: Isn't this great?  The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face . . .
  a perfect day to be at sea!
Grimsby: (Leaning over side.) Oh yes . . . delightful . . . .
Sailor 1: A fine strong wind and a following sea.  King Triton must be in a
  friendly-type mood.
Eric: King Triton?
Sailor 2: Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad.  Thought every good sailor knew
  about him.
Grimsby: Merpeople!  Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
Sailor 2: But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth!  I'm tellin' you, down in the
  depths o' the ocean they live. (He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops
  away and lands back in the ocean, relieved.)
Sailors: Heave. ho. Heave, ho. In mysterious fathoms below. (Fish sighs and
  swims away.)

     (Titles. Various fish swimming. Merpeople converge on a great undersea
palace, filling concert hall inside. Fanfare ensues.)

Seahorse: Ahem . . . His royal highness, King Triton! (Triton enters
  dramatically to wild cheering.) And presenting the distinguished court
  composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! (Sebastion
  enters to mild applause.)
Triton: I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever con-
  ducted.  Your daughters - they will be spectacular!
Triton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel.
Sebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . .  [sotto] If only
  she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . . (He proceeds to podium
  and begins to direct orchestra.)
Triton's daughters: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton.
  Great father who loves us and named us well:
  Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.
  And then there is the youngest in her musical debut,
  Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,
  To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,
  She's our sister, Ar-i . . .
  (Shell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent.)
Triton: (Very angry.) Ariel!!

      (Cut to Ariel looking at sunken ship.)

Flounder: (From distance.) Ariel, wait for me . . .
Ariel: Flounder, hurry up!
Flounder: (Catching up.) You know I can't swim that fast.
Ariel: There it is.  Isn't it fantastic?
Flounder: Yeah . . . sure . . . it - it's great.  Now let's get outta here.
Ariel: You're not getting cold fins now, are you?
Flounder: Who, me?  No way.  It's just, it, err . . . it looks - damp in there.
  Yeah.  And I think I may be coming down with something.  Yeah, I got this
  cough. (Flounder coughs unconvincingly)
Ariel: All right.  I'm going inside.  You can just stay here and - watch for
  sharks. (She goes inside.)
Flounder: O.K.  Yeah - you go.  I'll stay and - what?  Sharks!  Ariel!
  (He tries to fit through porthole.) Ariel . . . I can't . . . I mean-
  Ariel help!
Ariel: (Laughs.) Oh, Flounder.
Flounder: (Wispering.)Ariel, do you really think there might be sharks around
  here? (Shark passes outside.)
Ariel: Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
Flounder: I'm not a guppy. (Gets pulled through porthole.)This is great - I
  mean, I really love this.  Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around
  every corn- YAAAAHHHHHHHH!! Ariel!! (He sees a skull, crashes into pillar
  causing cave in, and swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel.)
Ariel: Oh, are you okay?
Flounder: Yeah sure, no problem, I'm okay . . .
Ariel: Shhh . . . (Seeing a fork.) Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Have you ever
  seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Flounder: Wow, cool!  But, err, what is it?
Ariel: I don't know.  But I bet Scuttle will.
  (Puts fork in bag. Skark swims by outside.)
Flounder: What was that? Did you hear something?
Ariel: (Distracted by pipe.) Hmm, I wonder what this one is?
Flounder: Ariel . .
Ariel: Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen.
Flounder: (Seeing Shark looming behind him.) AAHHHH!! Run!! Run!! We're
  gonna die!! (Shark chases them all around. Ariel's bag is hung up. She
  goes back for it. Shark almost gets them. They head for porthole.) Oh No!!
  (They crash through and go round and round. Flounder gets knocked silly
  but Ariel saves him and traps Shark) You big bully. THBBBTTTT . . .
  (Shark snaps at him and he swims away.)
Ariel: (Laughing.) Flounder, you really are a guppy.
Flounder: I am not.

     (On surface. Scuttle on his island humming and looking through his
telescope.)

Ariel: Scuttle!
Scuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa!
   Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin' kid? (Lowers telescope to
   reveal Ariel at wing's length.) Whoa, what a swim!
Ariel: Scuttle - look what we found.
Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy.
Scuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this.
  Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.
Ariel: What?  What is it?
Scuttle: It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to
  straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an' a yank
  there and - voiolay!  You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration
  of hair that humans go nuts over!
Ariel: A dinglehopper!
Flounder: What about that one?
Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.  This is wonderful!
  A banded, bulbous - snarfblat.
Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh.
Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used
  to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they
  invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me.
  (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.)
Ariel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me!
Flounder: The concert was today?
Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter
  out of it or somethin'.
Ariel: Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.)
Scuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime.

     (Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic
projection of Ariel swimming.)

Ursula: Yeeeeeees, hurry home, princess.  We wouldn't want to miss old daddy's
  celebration, now, would we?  Huh!  Celebration indeed.  Bah!  In MY day, we
  had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace.  And now, look at me -
  wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically
  starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate.  Well, I'll give 'em
  something to celebrate soon enough.  Flotsam!  Jetsam!  I want you to keep an
  extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.  She may be the key
  to Triton's undoing. . . .

     (Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished.)

Triton: I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Ariel: Daddy, I'm sorry, I just forgot, I -
Triton: As a result of your careless behaviour -
Sebastian: Careless and reckless behaviour!
Triton: - the entire celebration was, er -
Sebastian: Well, it was ruined!  That's all.  Completely destroyed! This
  concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to
  you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!
Flounder: But it wasn't her fault! Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us
  - yeah - yeah!  And we tried to - but we couldn't - and - grrrrrrrrr - and -
  and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe. But then this seagull came,
  and it was this is this, and that is that, and -
Triton: Seagull?  What?  Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn't you?
  DIDN'T YOU?
Ariel: Nothing - happened. . . .
Triton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this?  You could've been
  seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!
Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians!
Triton: They're dangerous.  Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter
  snared by some fish-eater's hook?
Ariel: I'm sixteen years old - I'm not a child anymore -
Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady.  As long as you
  live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
Ariel: But if you would just listen -
Triton: Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the
  surface again.  Is that clear? (Ariel leaves, crying.)
Sebastian: Hm! Teenagers. . . .  They think they know everything.  You give
  them an inch, they swim all over you.
Triton: Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?
Sebastian: Definitely not.  Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was
  boss.  None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense.  No,
  sir - I'd keep her under tight control.
Triton: You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Of course.
Triton: Ariel needs constant supervision.
Sebastian: Constant.
Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.
Sebastian: All the time -
Triton: And YOU are just the crab to do it.

     (Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor.)

Sebastian: How do I get myself into these situations?  I should be writing
  symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. (Sees Ariel
  and Flounder sneaking off and follows.) Hmm? What is that girl up to? (He
  barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel's collection.) Huh?
Flounder: Ariel, are you okay?
Ariel: If only I could make him understand.  I just don't see things the way he
  does. I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be
  bad.

   Look at this stuff
   Isn't it neat?
   Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
   Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
   The girl who has ev'rything?
   Look at this trove
   Treasures untold
   How many wonders can one cavern hold?
   Lookin' around here you'd think
   Sure, she's got everything

   I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
   I've got whozits and whatzits galore
   (You want thingamabobs?
   I got twenty)
   But who cares?
   No big deal
   I want more

   I wanna be where the people are
   I wanna see
   Wanna see 'em dancin'
   Walkin' around on those
   (Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet
   Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
   Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
   Strollin' along down a
   (What's that word again?) street

   Up where they walk
   Up where they run
   Up where they stay all day in the sun
   Wanderin' free
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

   What would I give
   If I could live
   Outta these waters?
   What would I pay
   To spend a day
   Warm on the sand?
   Betcha on land
   They understand
   Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
   Bright young women
   Sick o' swimmin'
   Ready to stand

   And ready to know what the people know
   Ask 'em my questions
   And get some answers
   What's a fire and why does it
   (What's the word?) burn?

   When's it my turn?
   Wouldn't I love
   Love to explore that shore above?
   Out of the sea
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

  (Sebastion has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making
  a lot of noise.)
Ariel: Sebastion!?
Sebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad?  How could you - what is all this?
Ariel: It, err, it's just my - collection. . . .
Sebastian: Oh.  I see.  Your collection.  Hmmm.  IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS
  PLACE HE'D -
Flounder: You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Ariel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.
Sebastian: Ariel.  You're under a lot of pressure down here.  Come with me,
  I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink. (A ship passes by
  overhead.)
Ariel: What do you suppose?. . .
Sebastion: Ariel? Ariel!

     (On surface. Fireworks in the sky around ship. Ariel looks on,
amazed. Sebastion and Flounder arrive.)

Sebastion: Ariel, what - what are you- jumpin' jellyfish! Ariel, Ariel!
  Please come back! (Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds
  her.)
Eric: (Whistles.) Max, here boy. Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh
  Max? Good boy. (Ariel sees him and is stricken.)
Scuttle: Hey there, sweetie!  Quite a show, eh?
Ariel: Scuttle, be quiet!  They'll hear you.
Scuttle: Oooh, I gotcha, I gotcha.  We're being intrepidatious.  WE'RE OUT TO
  DISCOVER! (Ariel grabs his beak.)
Ariel: I've never seen a human this close before.  Oh - he's very handsome,
  isn't he?
Scuttle: (Looking at Max) I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.
Ariel: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat.
Grimsby: Silence!  Silence!  It is now my honour and privilege to present our
  esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday
  present.
Eric: Ah, Grimsby - y'old beanpole, you shouldn't have.
Grimsby: I know. Happy birthday, Eric! (Large, gaudy statue of Eric is
  revealed. Max growls.)
Eric: Gee, Grim.  It's, err, it's, err - it's really somethin'. . . .
Grimsby: Yes, I commissioned it myself.  Of course, I had hoped it would be a
  wedding present, but . . .
Eric: Come on, Grim, don't start.  Look, you're not still sore because I didn't
  fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you?
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.  The entire kingdom wants to see you
  happily settled down with the right girl.
Eric: Well, she's out there somewhere.  I just - I just haven't found her yet.
Grimsby: Well, perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Eric: Believe me, Grim, when I find her I'll know - without a doubt.  It'll
  just - bam! - hit me - like lightning. (Lightning and thunder appear and the
  sky grows dark.)
Sailor: Hurricane a'commin'!! Stand fast! Secure the riggin'! (Storm hits.)
Scuttle: Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here. (He is blown
  away.) Oh! Ariel . . . (Ship crashes through storm. Lightning starts a fire.
  A rock looms ahead.)
Eric: Look out! . . . (Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max.)
  Grim, hang on! (Sees Max.) Max! (Goes back to save him.) Jump Max! Come
  on boy, jump! You can do it Max. (He saves Max but is trapped on board.)
Grimsby: ERIC! (Ship explodes. Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him
  away.)

     (On beach. Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric.)

Ariel: Is he - dead?
Scuttle: (Opens Eric's eyelid.) It's hard to say. (Puts his ear against Eric's
  foot.)  Oh, I - I can't make out a heartbeat.
Ariel: No, look! He's breathing. He's so, beautiful.

   What would I give
   To live where you are?
   What would I pay
   To stay here beside you?
   What would I do to see you
   Smiling at me?

   Where would we walk?
   Where would we run?
   If we could stay all day in the sun?
   Just you and me
   And I could be
   Part of your world

  (Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene. Max and
  Grimsby approach. Ariel hurries away.)
Grimsby: Eric!  Oh, Eric.  You really delight in these sadistic strains on my
  blood pressure, don't you?
Eric: A girl - rescued me. . . .  She was - singing . . . she had the most -
  beautiful voice.
Grimsby: Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater.  Off we
  go.  Come on, Max.
Sebastian: We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened.  The sea king
  will never know.  You won't tell him, I won't tell him.  I will stay in one
  piece.
Ariel:
   I don't know when
   I don't know how
   But I know something's starting right now
   Watch and you'll see
   Some day I'll be
   Part of your world

     (Flotsam and Jetsam appear. Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber.)

Ursula: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't stand it - it's too easy.  The
  child is in love with a human.  And not just any human - a prince!  Her
  daddy'll LOVE that.  King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a
  charming addition to my little garden.

     (Fade to palace. Then sister's dressing room.)

Andrina: Ariel, dear, time to come out.  You've been in there all morning.
  (Ariel emerges, singing to herself.)
Atina: What is with her lately?
Ariel: Morning, Daddy.  (Ariel swims off.)
Atina: Oh, she's got it bad.
Triton: What? What has she got?
Andrina: Isn't it obvious, Daddy?  Ariel's in love.
Triton: Ariel?  In love?

     (Cut to Sebastion pacing on rock outside.)

Sebastian: O.K. So far, so good.  I don't think the king knows. But it will not
  be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
Ariel: (Picking petals off a flower) He loves me . . . hmmm, he loves me
  not. . . .  He loves me!  I knew it!
Sebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy.
Ariel: I gotta see him again - tonight!  Scuttle knows where he lives.
Sebastian: Ariel - please.  Will you get your head out of the clouds and back
  in the water where it belongs?
Ariel: I'll swim up to his castle.  Then Flounder will splash around to get his
  attention, and then with -
Sebastian: Down HERE is your home! Ariel - listen to me.  The human world -
  it's a mess.  Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.

   The seaweed is always greener
   In somebody else's lake
   You dream about going up there
   But that is a big mistake
   Just look at the world around you
   Right here on the ocean floor
   Such wonderful things surround you
   What more is you lookin' for?

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Darling it's better
   Down where it's wetter
   Take it from me
   Up on the shore they work all day
   Out in the sun they slave away
   While we devotin'
   Full time to floatin'
   Under the sea

   Down here all the fish is happy
   As off through the waves they roll
   The fish on the land ain't happy
   They sad 'cause they in their bowl
   But fish in the bowl is lucky
   They in for a worser fate
   One day when the boss get hungry
   Guess who's gon' be on the plate

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Nobody beat us
   Fry us and eat us
   In fricassee
   We what the land folks loves to cook
   Under the sea we off the hook
   We got no troubles
   Life is the bubbles
   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Since life is sweet here
   We got the beat here
   Naturally
   Even the sturgeon an' the ray
   They get the urge 'n' start to play
   We got the spirit
   You got to hear it
   Under the sea

   The newt play the flute
   The carp play the harp
   The plaice play the bass
   And they soundin' sharp
   The bass play the brass
   The chub play the tub
   The fluke is the duke of soul
   (Yeah)
   The ray he can play
   The lings on the strings
   The trout rockin' out
   The blackfish she sings
   The smelt and the sprat
   They know where it's at
   An' oh that blowfish blow

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   When the sardine
   Begin the beguine
   It's music to me
   What do they got? A lot of sand
   We got a hot crustacean band
   Each little clam here
   know how to jam here
   Under the sea
   Each little slug here
   Cuttin' a rug here
   Under the sea
   Each little snail here
   Know how to wail here
   That's why it's hotter
   Under the water
   Ya we in luck here
   Down in the muck here
   Under the sea

  (They discover that Ariel has left with Flounder.)
  Ariel? Ariel? Oh . . . somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Seahorse: Sebastian!  Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.  I've got
  an urgent message from the sea king.
Sebastian: The sea king?
Seahorse: He wants to see you right away - something about Ariel.
Sebastian: He knows!

     (In palace throne room. Triton looking at flower.)

Triton: Let's see, now. . . .  Oh, who could the lucky merman be? (Notices
  Sebastion.) Come in, Sebastion.
Sebastian: (Sotto) I mustn't overreact.  I must remain calm.  (Five octaves
  higher than normal) Yes - (loco) yes, Your Majesty.
Triton: Now, Sebastian, I'm concerned about Ariel.  Have you noticed she's been
  acting peculiar lately?
Sebastian: Peculiar?
Triton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself. . . .  You
  haven't noticed, hmm?
Sebastian: Oh - well, I -
Triton: Sebastian. . . .
Sebastian: Hmmm?
Triton: I know you've been keeping something from me. . . .
Sebastian: Keeping . . . something?
Triton: About Ariel?
Sebastian: Ariel . . . ?
Triton: In love?
Sebastian: I tried to stop her, sir.  She wouldn't listen.  I told her to stay
  away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they -
Triton: Humans?  WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?
Sebastian: Humans?  Ho ho ho ho. . . . Who said anything about humans?

     (Fade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave.)

Ariel: Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder: You'll see. It's a suprise.
Ariel: (Sees statue of Eric.) Oh, Flounder- Flounder you're the best! it looks
  just like him.  It even has his eyes.  "Why, Eric, run away with you?  This
  is all so - so sudden. . . . (Turns around and sees Triton.) Daddy! . . .
Triton: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I
  expect those rules to be obeyed.
Ariel: But Daddy!-
Triton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowing?
Ariel: Daddy, I had to-
Triton: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly for-
  bidden. Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that!
Ariel: He would have died-
Triton: One less human to worry about!
Ariel: You don't even know him.
Triton: Know him? I don't have to know him. They're all the same. Spineless,
  savage, harpooning, fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling-
Ariel: Daddy, I love him!
Triton: No . . . Have you lost your senses completely? He's a human, you're
  a mermaid!
Ariel: I don't care.
Triton: So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you. And if this is the
  only way, so be it. (Begins to blast the artifacts with his trident.)
Ariel: Daddy!. . . No . . . No, please- Daddy, stop!. . . Daddy, Nooo!!. . .
  (He blasts statue. Ariel begins crying and he leaves, ashamed.)
Sebastion: Ariel, I . . .
Ariel: (Still crying.) Just go away. (He leaves and Flotsan and Jetsam appear.)
Flotsam: Poor child.
Jetsam: Poor, sweet child.
Flotsam: She has a very serious problem
Jetsam: If only there were something we could do.
Flotsam: But there is something.
Ariel: Who - who are you?
Jetsam: Don't be scared.
Flotsam: We represent someone who can help you.
Jetsam: Someone who could make all your dreams come true.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Just imagine -
Jetsam: You and your prince -
Flotsam and Jetsam: Together, forever. . . .
Ariel: I don't understand.
Jetsam: Ursula has great powers
Ariel: The sea witch?  Why, that's - I couldn't possibly - no!  Get out of
 here!  Leave me alone!
Flotsam: Suit yourself.
Jetsam: It was only a suggestion.
  [Jetsam flicks the statue's broken face towards Ariel.]
Ariel: [Looking at the face] Wait.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Yeeeeeeeeeess?

     (Cut to outside of cave with Flounder and Sebastion.)

Flounder: (snif) Poor Ariel.
Sebastion: I didn't mean to tell, it was an accident. (Ariel passes by.)
  Ariel - where are you going?  Ariel, what are you doing here with this
  riff-raff?
riel: I'm going to see Ursula.
Sebastian: Ariel, no!  No, she's a demon, she's a monster!
Ariel: Why don't you go tell my father?  You're good at that.
Sebastion: But . . . But, I . . . (To Flounder.) Come on. (They travel towards
  Ursula's cavern.)
Flotsam and Jetsam: This way. (Ariel enters and is hung up in the garden of
  souls.)
Ursula: Come in.  Come in, my child.  We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude.
  One MIGHT question your upbringing. . . . Now, then.  You're here because
  you have a thing for this human.  This, er, prince fellow.  Not that I blame
  you - he is quite a catch, isn't he?  Well, angel fish, the solution to your
  problem is simple.  The only way to get what you want - is to become a human
  yourself.
Ariel: Can you DO that?
Ursula: My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To help
  unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

   I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
   They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
   But you'll find that nowadays
   I've mended all my ways
   Repented, seen the light and made a switch
   True? Yes

   And I fortunately know a little magic
   It's a talent that I always have possessed
   And here lately, please don't laugh
   I use it on behalf
   Of the miserable, lonely and depressed
   (Pathetic)

   Poor unfortunate souls
   In pain
   In need
   This one longing to be thinner
   That one wants to get the girl
   And do I help them?
   Yes, indeed
   Those poor unfortunate souls
   So sad
   So true
   They come flocking to my cauldron
   Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"
   And I help them?
   Yes, I do

   Now it's happened once or twice
   Someone couldn't pay the price
   And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
   Yes, I've had the odd complaint
   But on the whole I've been a saint
   To those poor unfortunate souls

  Now, here's the deal.  I will make you a potion that will turn you into
  a human for three days.  Got that?  Three days.  Now listen, this is import-
  ant.  Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol'
  princey to fall in love with you.  That is, he's got to kiss you.  Not just
  any kiss - the kiss of true love.  If he does kiss you before the sun sets on
  the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you
  turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.
Sebastion: No Ariel! (He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam.)
Ursula: Have we got a deal?
Ariel: If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
Ursula: That's right. . . .  But - you'll have your man.  Life's full of tough
  choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the
  subject of payment.  You can't get something for nothing, you know.
Ariel: But I don't have any -
Ursula: I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle.  You'll never even
  miss it.  What I want from you is . . . your voice.
Ariel: My voice?
Ursula: You've got it, sweetcakes.  No more talking, singing, zip.
Ariel: But without my voice, how can I -
Ursula: You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the
  importance of body language! Ha!

   The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
   They think a girl who gossips is a bore
   Yes, on land it's much preferred
   For ladies not to say a word
   And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

   Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
   True gentlemen avoid it when they can
   But they dote and swoon and fawn
   On a lady who's withdrawn
   It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man

   Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
   Go ahead!
   Make your choice!
   I'm a very busy woman
   And I haven't got all day
   It won't cost much
   Just your voice!
   You poor unfortunate soul
   It's sad
   But true
   If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
   You've got to pay the toll
   Take a gulp and take a breath
   And go ahead and sign the scroll!
   Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
   The boss is on a roll
   This poor unfortunate soul.

  (Ariel signs contract.)
   Paluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea.
   Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis,
   La voce to me!
  Now . . . sing!
Ariel: (Sings.)
Ursula: Keep singing! (Giant magical hands rip out Ariel's voice and give it to
  Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf-
  ace by Flounder and Sebastion.)

     (Fade to beach. Eric and Max are walking near castle.)

Eric: (Playing flute.) That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked
  everywhere, Max - where could she be? (On other side of rocks Ariel is
  washed up. Sebastion and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is
  amazed.)
Scuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!  Look at ya!  Look at ya!
  There's something different.  Don't tell me - I got it.  It's your hairdo,
  right?  You've been using the dinglehopper, right?  No?  No huh, well let me
  see.  New . . . seashells?  No new seashells.  I gotta admit I can't put my
  foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I'll -
Sebastian: SHE'S GOT LEGS, YOU IDIOT!  She traded her voice to the sea witch
  and got legs.  Jeez, man . . .
Scuttle: I knew that.
Flounder: Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in
  love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her. (Ariel tries to get
  up.)
Sebastion: And she's only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human
  legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe!  What would her father say?
  I'll tell you what her father'd say, he'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab,
  that's what her father'd say! I'm gonna march meself straight home right now
  and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him.) . . . and
  don't you shake your head at me, young lady.  Maybe there's still time. If
  we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with
  all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for
  the rest of your life.  All right, all right.  I'll try to help you find that
  prince.  Boy.  What a soft-shell I'm turning out to be.
Scuttle: Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing
  you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.

     (Cut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.)

Eric: Max? Huh . . . what, Max!
Scuttle: (Whistles.) Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational. (They hear Max.
  He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock.)
Eric: Max . . . Max - Quiet Max! What's gotten into you fella? (Sees Ariel.)
  Oh . . . Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss?  I'm sorry if this knucklehead
  scared you.  He's harmless, really - . . . you . . . seem very familiar . . .
  to me.  Have we met?  We have met?  I knew it!  You're the one - the one I've
  been looking for!  What's your name? (Ariel mouths "Ariel" but no words come
  out.) What's wrong?  What is it?  You can't speak? (Ariel shakes her head.)
  Oh.  Then you couldn't be who I thought. (Ariel and Max look frustrated. She
  tries pantomime.) What is it?  You're hurt?  No, No . . . You need help.
  (She falls into him.) Whoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy. Gee, you must
  have really been through something. Don't worry, I'll help you. Come on . . .
  Come on, you'll be okay.

     (Fade to Ariel in bath playing with bubbles.)

Carlotta: Washed up from a shipwreck.  Oh, the poor thing.  We'll have you
  feeling better in no time.  [Picks up Ariel's "dress"] I'll just - I'll just
  get this washed for you.

     (Cut to Sebastion in dress getting washed.)
Woman 1: Well you must have at least heard about this girl.
Woman 2: Well, Gretchen says . . . (Sebastion is dunked.) . . . since when has
  Gretchen got anything right. I mean really, this girl shows up in rags and
  doesn't speak-
Sebastion: Madame, please ! . . .
Woman 2: . . . not my idea of a princess. If Eric's looking for a girl, I know
  a couple of highly available ones right here . . . (Sebastion dives into
  kitchen and sees various fish cooking. He faints.)

     (Cut to castle dining room.)

Grimsby: Oh, Eric, be reasonable.  Nice young ladies just don't - swim around
  rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into
  oblivion, like some -
Eric: I'm tellin' you, Grim, she was REAL!  I'm gonna find that girl - and I'm
  gonna marry her.
Carlotta: Ha Ha. Come on honey. Don't be shy. (Ariel enteres in a beautiful
  dress.)
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Eric: You look - wonderful.
Grimsby: Come come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear. There
  we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It's - It's not ofen that we have such a lovely
  dinner guest, eh Eric? (Ariel starts combing hair with a fork. They look
  dumbfounded and she is embarrased. She sees pipe and brightens.) Uh, do you
  like it? It is rather - fine . . . (She blows its contents into his face.
  Eric laughs.)
Carlotta: Oh, my!
Eric: Ahem, so sorry Grim.
Carlotta: Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks.
Grimsby: (Wiping his face.) Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what's for
  dinner?
Carlotta: Oooh, you're gonna love it.  Chef's been fixing his specialty,
  stuffed crab.

     (Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook. He is humming to himself.)

Louis:
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   How I love les poissons
   Love to chop
   And to serve little fish
   First I cut off their heads
   Then I pull out the bones
   Ah mais oui
   Ca c'est toujours delish
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   Hee hee hee
   Hah hah hah
   With the cleaver I hack them in two
   I pull out what's inside
   And I serve it up fried
   God, I love little fishes
   Don't you?

   Here's something for tempting the palate
   Prepared in the classic technique
   First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
   Then you slash through the skin
   Give the belly a slice
   Then you rub some salt in
   'Cause that makes it taste nice
  Zut alors, I have missed one!

   Sacre bleu
   What is this?
   How on earth could I miss
   Such a sweet little succulent crab?
   Quel dommage
   What a loss
   Here we go in the sauce
   Now some flour, I think
   Just a dab
   Now I stuff you with bread
   It don't hurt 'cause you're dead
   And you're certainly lucky you are
   'Cause it's gonna be hot
   In my big silver pot
   Toodle loo mon poisson
   Au revoir!

  (Sebastion hops back and Louis grabs him again.) What is this? (Sebastion
  pinches his nose and a battle ensues. Louis knocks over a large cabinet.)

     (Cut to dining room. Huge crash is heard.)

Carlotta: I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.

     (Back to kitchen. Louis is trashing the place.)

Louis: Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man!
Carlotta: Louis!  What are you doing?
Louis: Well - I - I was just - er, er, I'm sorry, madame.

     (Cut back to dining room.)

Grimsby: You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the
  sights of the kingdom.  Something in the way of a tour?
Eric: I'm sorry, Grim, what was that?
Grimsby: You can't spend all your time moping about, you need to get out.  Do
  something, have a life.  (Grimsby lifts his plate's cover to reveal Sebastian
  cowering in the salad.)  Get your mind off -
Eric: Easy, Grim, Easy.  (Ariel lifts her own plate cover and signals for
  Sebastian to hide there.  Sebastian rushes across while no one is looking.)
  It's not a bad idea.  If she's interested.  Well - whaddaya say?  Would you
  like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
  (Ariel nods vigorously, leaning heavily on her plate's cover.)
Grimsby: Wonderful, now let's eat, before this crab wanders off my plate.

     (Fade to Ariel watching Eric and Max from balcony.)

Eric: Come here boy! . . . Arrr . . . (He sees Ariel and waves. She is emb-
  arassed and goes back inside.)
Sebastian: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day
  of my life.  I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.
  Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.  Tomorrow, when he
  takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.  You gotta bat your eyes -
  like this.  You gotta pucker up your lips - like this. (He sees she is
  asleep.) Hm. You are hopeless child. You know dat? Completely hopeless . . .

     (Fade to undersea palace. Seahorse swims up to Triton.)

Triton: Any sign of them?
Seahorse: No, Your Majesty.  We've searched everywhere.  We've found no trace
  of your daughter - or Sebastian.
Triton: Well, keep looking.  Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.  Let
  no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
Seahorse: Yes sire. (He leaves.)
Triton: Oh, what have I done? What have I done?

     (Morning at castle. Ariel and Eric leave for their tour. Ariel is amazed
by everything.)
Flounder: (As they pass water.) Has he kissed her yet?
Sebastion: Not yet.
Flounder: Ohh . . . (Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town.)
Scuttle: Yo, Flounder! Any kissing?
Flounder: No, not yet.
Scuttle: Hmm. Well they - they better get crackin'. (They leave town and Ariel
  drives, almost crashing. They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the even-
  ing.)
Flounder: Move over - move your big feathers.  I can't see a thing.
Scuttle: Nothing is happening. . . .  Only one day left, and that boy ain't
  puckered up once.  O.K.  All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic
  stimulation. Stand back. (He flies over and sings very badly.)
Eric: Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
Sebastian: Jeez, man, I'm surrounded by amateurs!  You want something done,
  you've got to do it yourself.  First, we got to create the mood.
  Percussion. . . .  Strings. . . .  Winds. . . .  Words. . . .

   There you see her
   Sitting there across the way
   She don't got a lot to say
   But there's something about her
   And you don't know why
   But you're dying to try
   You wanna kiss the girl

Eric: Did you hear something?
Sebastion:
   Yes, you want her
   Look at her, you know you do
   Possible she wants you too
   There is one way to ask her
   It don't take a word
   Not a single word
   Go on and kiss the girl

   Sha la la la la la
   My oh my
   Look like the boy too shy
   Ain't gonna kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Ain't that sad?
   Ain't it a shame?
   Too bad, he gonna miss the girl

Eric: You know, I feel really bad not knowing your name.  Heh - maybe I could
  guess.  Is it, err, Mildred?  O.K., no.  How 'bout - Diana?  Rachel?
Sebastian: Ariel.  Her name is Ariel.
Eric: Ariel?  Ariel?  Well, that's kinda pretty.  O.K. - Ariel. . .
Sebastion:
   Now's your moment
   Floating in a blue lagoon
   Boy you better do it soon
   No time will be better
   She don't say a word
   And she won't say a word
   Until you kiss the girl

   Sha la la la la la
   Don't be scared
   You got the mood prepared
   Go on and kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Don't stop now
   Don't try to hide it how
   You want to kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Float along
   And listen to the song
   The song say kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la
   The music play
   Do what the music say
   You got to kiss the girl
   You've got to kiss the girl
   You wanna kiss the girl
   You've gotta kiss the girl
   Go on and kiss the girl

  (The boat tips over.)
Eric: Whoa, hang on - I've gottcha. (Flotsam and Jetsam congradulate each
  other.)

     (Cut to Ursula's cavern.)

Ursula: Nice work, boys.  That was a close one.  Too close.  The little tramp!
  Oh, she's better than I thought.  At this rate, he'll be kissing her by
  sunset for sure.  Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles!
  Triton's daughter will be mine - and then I'll make him writhe.  I'll see him
  wriggle like a worm on a hook! (Laughing, she transforms into a human with
  Ariel's voice.)

     (Fade to castle at night. Eric is playing the flute and contemplating as
Grimsby approaches.)

Grimsby: Eric, if I may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh
  and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes. (He sees Ariel,
  sighs, and tosses away flute. He is distracted by Ursula/Vanessa singing with
  Ariel's voice and is placed under her spell.)

     (Scuttle flying toward castle in morning.)

Scuttle: Ariel!  Ariel, wake up!  Wake up!  I just heard the news.  Congratula-
  tions, kiddo, we did it!
Sebastian: What is this idiot babbling about?
Scuttle: Right - as if you two didn't know, uh?  The whole town's buzzin' about
  the prince gettin' himself hitched this afternoon!  You know, he's getting
  married!  You silly sidewalker!  I just wanted to wish you luck.  I'll catch
  you later, I wouldn't miss it! (Ariel brightens and runs downstairs, only to
  see Eric and Vanessa together.)
Grimsby: Well, uh - err, Eric.  I-it appears that I was mistaken.  This mystery
  maiden of yours does - in fact exist.  And - and she is lovely.  Congratula-
  tions, my dear.
Eric: We wish to be married as soon as possible.
Grimsby: Oh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time,
  you know. . . .
Eric: This afternoon, Grimsby.  The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Grimsby: Oh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish. (Ariel runs off crying.)

     (Cut to late afternoon as wedding ship starts to leave. Ariel on pier
crying bitterly as Sebastion and Flounder look on.)

     (Cut to Scuttle flying and humming to himself.)

Vanessa: What a lovely little bride I'll make, my dear I'll look divine
  Things are working out according to my ultimate design
  Soon I'll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine!
Scuttle: (Seeing real Ursula in mirror.) The sea witch! Oh no . . . She's-
  I gotta. . . (Runs into side of ship. Flies off to find Ariel.) Ariel!
  Ariel!  Ariel.  I was flying, I wa - of course I was flying - An' - I s- I
  saw that the watch - the witch was watchin' a mirror, and she was singin'
  with a stolen set o' pipes!  Do you hear what I'm tellin' you? THE PRINCE
  IS MARRYING THE SEA WITCH IN DISGUISE!
Sebastian: Are you sure about this?
Scuttle: Have I ever been wrong?  I mean when it's important!
Flounder: What are we gonna do!? (Ariel hears Ursula's voice in her head as the
  sun drops.)
Ursula: . . . Before the sun sets on the third day. . . . (Ariel jumps in water
  but can't swim well. Sebastion sends down some barrels.)
Sebastion: Ariel, grab on to that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as
  your fins can carry you!
Flounder: I'll try.
Sebastian: I've gotta get to the sea king.  He must know about this.
Scuttle: What - What about me?  What about ME?
Sebastian: You - find a way to STALL THAT WEDDING!
Scuttle: Stall the wedding. Wh- what am I - what - that's it! (He flies off to
  rally the animals and fish.) Move it, let's go, we got an emergency here!

     (Cut to wedding in progress. Max growls at Vanessa but she kicks him.)

Priest: Dearly beloved . . . (Flounder is pulling Ariel toward ship.)
Flounder: Don't worry Ariel. ugh - we - we're gonna make it. We're almost
  there.
Priest: Yes, um, do you Eric, take Vanessa, to be your lawfully wedded wife,
  for as long as you both shall live?
Eric: (Under spell.) I do.
Priest: Eh, and do you . . . (Birds and animals swoop in for attack, causing
  great chaos.) . . . then by the power inves-
Vanessa: Get away from me you slimy little- Oh, why you little- (In the
  struggle, the shell holding Ariel's voice it broken and it goes back to her.
  Eric comes out of the spell as she sings.)
Eric: Ariel?
Ariel: Eric.
Eric: You - you can talk.  You're the one.
Vanessa: Eric, get away from her!
Eric: It - it was you all the time.
Ariel: Oh, Eric, I - I wanted to tell you.
Vanessa: ERIC NO! (The sun sets and Ariel becomes a mermaid.)
Ursula: You're too late!  You're too late!  So long, loverboy.
Eric: Ariel! (Ursula and Ariel go overboard.)
Ursula: Poor little princess - it's not you I'm after.  I've a much bigger fish
  to -
Triton: Ursula, stop!
Ursula: Why, King Triton!  Ha ha ha - How ARE you?
Triton: Let her go.
Ursula: Not a chance, Triton!  She's mine now.  We made a deal.
Ariel: Daddy, I'm sorry!  I - I - I didn't mean to.  I didn't know -
  (Triton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident, to no
  avail.)
Ursula: You see? The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable -
  even for YOU. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.
  The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.  But - I
  might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better. . . .

     (Cut to Eric rowing away from ship.)

Grimsby: Eric! What are you doing?
Eric: Grim, I lost her once. I'm not going to lose her again.

     (Back to Ursula and Triton.)

Ursula: Now! Do we have a deal? (Triton signs contract.) Ha! It's done then.
  (Ariel is released and Triton is withered as Ursula laughs.)
Ariel: No . . . Oh, No!
Sebastion: Oh, your majesty . . .
Ariel: Daddy? . . .
Ursula: (Picks up crown.) At last, it's mine. Ho, Ho . . .
Ariel: You - You monster!
Ursula: Don't fool with me you little brat! Contract or no- AAAAHH! (She is hit
  with a harpoon thrown by Eric.) Why you little troll!
Ariel: Eric! Eric look out!
Ursula: After him! (Flotsam and Jetsam attack.)
Sebastion: Come on! . . .
Ursula: Say goodbye to your sweetheart. (Ariel makes her miss Eric and blast
  Flotsam and Jetsam.) Babies!  My poor, little poopsies!

     (On surface as Ursula grows beneath.)

Ariel: Eric, you've got to get away from here.
Eric: No, I won't leave you.
Ursula: (Now very large.) You pitiful, insignificant, fool!
Eric: Look out!
Ursula: Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!  The waves obey my every whim!
  The sea and all its spoils bow to my power! (She wrecks havoc, creates a
  whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks.)
Ariel: ERIC! (He gets on board one of the ships as Ariel falls to the bottom
  of the whirlpool. Ursula attempts to blast her.)
Ursula: (Laughing wickedly.) So much for true love! (As Ursula is about to
  finish Ariel, Eric steers the ship into her. She is impaled and dies most
  horribly. Eric collapses on the shore. The trident falls back to Triton and
  everything reverts to normal.)

     (Fade to morning with Eric on beach and Ariel watching from a distance.
Triton and Sebastion look on.)

Triton: She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?
Sebastian: Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty.  Children got to be free
  to lead their own lives.
Triton: You - always say that? (sighs) Then I guess there's just one problem
  left.
Sebastian: And what's that, Your Majesty?
Triton: How much I'm going to miss her. (He turns her into a human and she goes
  to meet Eric. They kiss which fades into kiss on wedding day. Everyone is
  happy. Sebastion is attacked by Louis. He beats Louis up and returns to the
  sea.)
Sebastion: Yes, Thank you, thank you. (Ariel and Triton hug.)
Ariel: I love you Daddy.

     (Big finale while "Part of Your World" music plays. Ship sails off as
Ariel and Eric kiss.)

All:     Now we can walk,
         Now we can run,
         Now we can stay all day in the sun.
         Just you and me,
         And I can be,
         Part of your world.

                THE END

"LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill

 


	FADE IN:

	EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

	A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
	the lights turn on.

				PEEPER
			(whispering)
		Showtime!

	We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
	window.  She is wearing business attire.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		Well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
		use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

	He sips some wine.

	The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Looks like Victoria just told me her
		secret.

	The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
	the words as he goes.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		I will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

	The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
		unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
		getting comfy.

	The son talks to his mother excitedly.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

	The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Now what.  This simply won't do.

	The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
	answers.

				SCOTTIE
		Hello?

				PEEPER
		Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.

				SCOTTIE
		Who is this?

				PEEPER
		Just a little birdie.  A birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.

				MOTHER
		Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
		our tree?

	The peeper gets nervous.

				PEEPER
		Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
	shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
	to the ground with a thud.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
		wear your bikini.

	The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

					   HARD CUT:

	INT. HOLE - DAY

	The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
	all sides.

	The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
	screaming like a five-year old girl.

	PEEPER'S POV

	We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
	peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
	SCREAMS.

	EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

	We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
	We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).

				GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
		Welcome!

	The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
	station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

				PEEPER
		Am I in hell?

				GATEKEEPER
		What do you think?

	A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

	MATTE PAINTING HELL

	MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

	The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
	the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

	Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
	"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

	The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
	NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

				NICKY
			(embarrassed)
		Hey...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your father wants to see you and your
		brothers in the throne room.

				NICKY
		Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

	INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

	ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
	people's faces that are coming through the wall.

				CASSIUS
		I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

				ADRIAN
		I've been waiting on this day for ten
		thousand years.

	He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaah!

				CASSIUS
		If the old man picks me to take over
		Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
		four seven.  No breaks.

				ADRIAN
		Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
		the torture.  You have to let people
		feel a sense of relief.

	Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
	in the eye.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

				ADRIAN
		Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
		is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

	Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

				CASSIUS
		I'll take that.

	Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
	It splatters like a grape.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Was that really necessary?

	Nicky enters sheepishly.

				CASSIUS
		Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
		today?

				NICKY
		Good, thanks.

	Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

				CASSIUS
		Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

	Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

				NICKY
		Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

	Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
	force.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!

				NICKY
			(picking up his head)
		Yes, you got me...

	Nicky's head slams back down again.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya, again!

				NICKY
			(picking head up)
		Got me for sure, yes...

	He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
	head.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

	Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
	own crotch.

				NICKY
		Oh no.  Please Cassius...

	Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
	until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Aaaaah.

	Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
	hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
	notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
	devil horns), enters behind them.

				DAD
		What are you boys doing?

	Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

				NICKY
		Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
		furniture.

				DAD
		Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
		of your brother's mind?

				CASSIUS
		I forgot.

				DAD
		Maybe this will help you remember.

	Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
	nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
	floor.

	Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
	confidence and power.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		Now everybody sit down.

				NICKY
		Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
		down my monsters of metal compilation
		tape.  I really think it's a
		masterpiece.

				DAD
		Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

	He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
	window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
	head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
	closes the curtains.

	Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
	his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
	of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
	his three sons.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
		thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
		here in hell for ten thousand years.
		And after this ten thousand years had
		passed, he decided to abdicate his
		throne...

	Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		...to step aside.
			(Nicky lowers his hand)
		...and let me become the ruler of hell.
		This, as some of you might know, is my
		ten thousandth year as Prince of
		Darkness.  So I think the time has come
		to discuss who will succeed me.

	Jimmy the Demon walks in.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Knock, knock.

				DAD
		Yes, Jimmy.

	He whispers in Dad's ear.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
		keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
		go.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
			(turning to leave)
		Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
		pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
		o'clock.

	Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
	back to his sons.

				DAD
		This was a very difficult decision,
		because I have three wonderful sons.  I
		mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
		And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
		Nicky, so...so...

				NICKY
		Don't worry about coming up with
		anything.  It's cool.

				DAD
		Such a sweet boy.  But after much
		thought and careful consideration, I've
		decided that the ruler for the next ten
		thousand years is going to have to
		be...me.

				CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
			(dumbfounded)
		What!?

				NICKY
		Hallelujah.

	They all look at Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I mean...tough break.

				DAD
		The important thing for the stability of
		our rule is to maintain the balance
		between good and evil.  And I don't
		think any of you are ready for that
		responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
		that comes only with the passage of
		time.

				CASSIUS
		Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

	Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
	Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
	tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

				DAD
		Right.  Right.  Send him in.
			(to the boys)
		I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
		to work.

	Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

				ADRIAN
		You sure about this decision, Dad?

				DAD
		I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
		thing to do.

	HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
	Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

	Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
	a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
	over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
	Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
	Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

	CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

	As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

				HITLER
		Holy schnit!!

	EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

	Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
	looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

				CASSIUS
		You work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.

				ADRIAN
		And he's dead serious.

				CASSIUS
		It's just such a slap in the face.

	Adrian turns to the Monster.

				ADRIAN
		Um, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.

				CASSIUS
		Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

	Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
	The Monster shrugs and walks off.

				ADRIAN
		Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
		Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
		getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
		need a place where we can rule.

	Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

				CASSIUS
		Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
		on!! Let's see what you got!

	The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

				CASSIUS (CONT'D)
		That's what I thought!

				ADRIAN
			(to Cassius)
		Could you concentrate for five seconds?

				CASSIUS
		I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

				ADRIAN
		What do you think about...Earth?

	Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		We could create our own hell there.

				CASSIUS
		You saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?

				ADRIAN
		Eventually, Cassius.  But first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...

				CASSIUS
		...their damned souls will be ours.

				ADRIAN
		It's our time, brother.

	The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
	fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey, what are you doing?!?

	They get closer to the fire.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You can't go through there.  The fire
		flows in, not out.

	They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You know something?  You guys suck!  You
		really suck!

	Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
	hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
	tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
	Pause.  Dad exhales.

				DAD
		Now that was an experience.  "You are
		only coming through in waves."  That
		line blows my mind every time.

				NICKY
		Definitely.

				DAD
		I don't care what kind of mood you're in
		at the start of that song.  When it's
		over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
		Great shit.  What's next?

				NICKY
		Well, I thought that after messing with
		your head, I'd give you a little kick in
		the keester.

	Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

				DAD
		Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

				NICKY
		Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

				DAD
		I was just playing with you.

	Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	CLOSE ON DAD.

				DAD
		I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
		I regretfully have to decline.

	ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

				DAN
		C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
		Superbowl ring.

				DAD
		In exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, Mr.
		Marino.

				DAN
		You did it for Namath.

				DAD
		Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
		Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
		records and the Hall of Fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.

				DAN
		This is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
		with or without you!

				DAD
		Now you're talking.

	Dan exits.

				NICKY
		You're a good devil, Dad.

				DAD
		And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

	Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.

				GATEKEEPER
		Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
		escaped from hell.  They went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  I think
		they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.

				DAD
		Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
		your knees.

	The Gatekeeper stands up.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  You're the man.  You've always
		been the man.

	Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
	only see them from the front for a second.
	From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to Nicky.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
			(to Nicky)
		I'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?

				NICKY
		Coulda been much worse.

				GATEKEEPER
		That's what I'm thinkin'...

	Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

				DAD
		This is bad, Nicky.

				NICKY
		How bad?

				DAD
		I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means I'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

				LUCIFER
		What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

				DAD
		Everything's fine, pop.

				LUCIFER
		Last time you said that the renaissance
		happened.

				DAD
		Please, pop, just go back to your room.

				LUCIFER
			(regarding gateskeeper)
		Can I take him with me and have sex with
		his head?

				DAD
		Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

	The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

				GATEKEEPER
		Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

	We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
	SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

	The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

				DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
		What's going on?  Where are we?

	We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Nothing's getting through that.  The
		fire is solid as a rock.

				NICKY
		We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		Ideas?

				DAD
		To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
		come back through the other way.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Dad!

				DAD
		I'm too weak.  The process has already
		begun.

	Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
	see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Jimmy!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
		devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.

				NICKY
		You're not saying it's up to me?

	The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I've never been to Earth.  I've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
		in you.

				DAD
		Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on Earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.

				NICKY
		Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
		and kill my brothers?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Not go.  They left together at the exact
		same time.  They gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

				DAD
		Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	The Monster gags.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your ol' man's got less than a week.

	Nicky looks petrified.

				NICKY
		No.  This can't be happening.

				DAD
		Son, just do your best.

	Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
	who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

	Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

	PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
	two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
	surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
	distance.

				NICKY
		Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
		doesn't look too bad.

	Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
	WHAMMM!

			EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
	the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were gone ten seconds.  What
		happened?

				NICKY
		I got hit by a big light that was
		attached to a lot of metal.

				DAD
		That's a train, son.  Don't stand in
		front of them.

				NICKY
		Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
		a mulligan on this one.

				DAD
		Please, Nicky, get back up there.
			(his ear falls off)
		Try to hurry.

	Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
	In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
	scrawled "NICKY."

	Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

				NICKY
		I'm Nicky.

	Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

				BEEFY
			(voice of Sandy Wernick)
		Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
		and come with me, shitstains.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

	The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

				BEEFY
		My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
		your father's.  He's asked me to help
		you out.

				NICKY
		I just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
		can possess people.  So they probably
		won't look like themselves.  You have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

				NICKY
		Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
		right on in there.

				BEEFY
		It's not me, moron.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry.

	EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
	money in his pot.

				PREACHER
		Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		He thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
		The Lord loves you...

	We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
	sniffs.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		The Lord does not love you.  I
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
		   face)
		You make the Lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		I'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		The Devil walks among us!

	He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

	He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
	disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Makin' friends already.

				NICKY
			(shivering a little)
		It's freezing up here, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
		you some warm clothes.

				NICKY
		I also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

				BEEFY
		That pain is hunger.

	EXT. BENCH - DAY

	K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
	an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
	is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
	CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

				NICKY
		So far, so good.  Now what?

				BEEFY
		Put it in your mouth.

	Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Move your teeth up and down.

	Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
		head back and let the meat slide down
		your throat-hole.

	Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

				NICKY
		Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

				BEEFY
		It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
		gonna need your energy.

				NICKY
		I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
		get cracking!

	NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
	into the path of a moving bus.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
	gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
	enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
	the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

	The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
	embarrassed.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey.

				NICKY
		That's a pretty brassiere.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks.

				NICKY
		Could you maybe not tell anyone about
		this?

				GATEKEEPER
		You got it.  Could you maybe not tell
		anyone about this?

				NICKY
		You got it.

	Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
	back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
	love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
	(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

	Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
	cautious.

				NICKY
		From now on.  I'm just going to avoid
		all moving metal objects.

				BEEFY
		Great.  Now your father gave me some
		deposit money for a nice pad on the
		Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

	Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
	is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
	dancing for him.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET

	Nicky and Beefy.

				BEEFY
		So I found this other joint for you.
		But you're gonna have a roommate.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

				TODD
			(on phone)
		I know exactly how you feel... The night
		Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
		"Is this man going to blow up the world,
		Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		Somebody's here.  Call you later.

	Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
	his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

				NICKY
		Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the Village
		Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?

				TODD
		Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
	nod imperceptibly.

				NICKY
		Yes.  What is rent?

				TODD
		Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
		Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
		my scene partner so the living room will
		be off limits.

				NICKY
		Off limits.

				TODD
		Right.  And as far as household items:
		we can share the soap, but we'll split
		the cost 60/40.
		Cause the person who physically goes out
		and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
		as much as the other guy.
			(looks at Nicky)
		Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

				NICKY
		No.

				TODD
		It's like eighty degrees in this
		hallway.  You from the South?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  The deep South.

	Nicky laughs a little too hard.

				TODD
		Why is that funny?

				NICKY
		I don't know.

				TODD
		And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

	Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

				BEEFY
		You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day
		tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep
		thing I told you about.

				NICKY
		Got ya.
			(to Todd)
		Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

				TODD
		Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

	The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
	reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
	it.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM

	Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
	clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
	familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
	hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

	SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
	looking concerned.

	EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

	We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
	large church.

	INT. CATHEDRAL

	CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
	steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
	We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
	gins his homily.

				CARDINAL
		In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of Heaven... or something like
		that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
		the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
		Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
		done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
		Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
		given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
		He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
		us.

	A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		The Lord gave my son the strength to get
		off drugs.

				CARDINAL
		Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
		he was better off on drugs.  He's a
		bore.  At least when he was smoking
		hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

	A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

				YOUNG MAN
		After we tried for many years, the Lord
		finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

				CARDINAL
		No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
		wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
		do anything for you?

	The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

				MAYOR
			(standing)
		Well, I wish I could think of something,
		Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
		can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a Lord.  If there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.

				CARDINAL
		Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

	The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
	Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Oh, this is delicious.

	ON MAYOR

	He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
			(laughing)
		"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
		one.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Well, we must get people sinning if we
		want to fill up our New Hell.  How are
		things going down at City Hall?

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		I lowered the drinking age to ten.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
		never want it to end.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

	The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

	Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
	same.

				NICKY
		This is intense!  And it happens every
		day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my
		hat to you people!

				BEEFY
		Look, it's okay for me to shit the
		street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

				NICKY
			(pulling up pants)
		Okay, just point me in the right
		direction next time.

				BEEFY
		Come on, there's like ten million people
		in this city and the clock is ticking.

				NICKY
		Well, let's rock and roll.

	Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
	DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
	him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
		You froze the gate and you're killing
		him.  Drink!

	Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

				CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
		I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

				NICKY
		just get in the flask!

	The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
	to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
		the head is gonna make me throw in the
		towel?  Well, in the immortal words of
		Judas Priest, "You got another thing
		comin'."

	Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
	bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
	long lense, real people, real reactions.)

	INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

	Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
	Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
	Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
	ordering some chicken.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
	his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
	it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
	to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
	grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
	Nicky as he walks away.

	INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

	Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
	polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
	flask.

	INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
	The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

				GATEKEEPER
		Bus?

				NICKY
		Beast.

	The Monster laughs.

				GATEKEEPER
			(to Monster)
		You like that?  You think that's funny?

	The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		How about that?  You like that?

	The Monster howls with delight.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
	Popeye's drumstick.

				NICKY
		All that running and chasing is making
		the sleep thing want to come early.

				BEEFY
		I think we have to work on narrowing
		down our list of suspects.  Now I'm
		going to go check in with some of my
		contacts uptown.

	Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
	Beefy sighs.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
		begging to come out...

	Beefy walks away.

	EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

	Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
	snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

	ON WORRIED PEOPLE

	Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
	GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
	goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
	it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

				PETER
		Sounds like our devil dance actually
		worked this time.

				JOHN
		'Bout time...

	Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
	worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
	Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

	Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		There's our man.

				PETER
		Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
		to the dark side.

	A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
	the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

				JOHN
		What's with that guy?

				PETER
		Gotta be one of his disciples or
		something.

	Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
	drumstick) and runs off.

				JOHN
		Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
		ripped off.

				PETER
		Should we wake him up?

				JOHN
		Yeah.  You do it.

	Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
	SNORT.

				PETER
		Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude
		just stole your shit.

	Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

				NICKY
		Oh nooooo....

	Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Which way did he go?

				JOHN
		That way.

	Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

				NICKY
		Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
		phenomenal.

	He runs off.

				PETER
		Did you check out the dragon mouth?

				JOHN
		The Dark Prince is here.

	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

	Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past
	several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
	sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
	sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
	blanket of the VENDOR.

				NICKY
		Hey...

				STREET VENDOR
		See something you like, my man?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I would like my flask back.

	The street vendor stands, very angry.

				STREET VENDOR
		You callin' me a thief, my man?

				NICKY
		No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
		has my flask.

				STREET VENDOR
		And if that is your so-called "flask,"
		how would I have it unless I was, in
		fact, a thief?

				NICKY
			(not sure what the answer is)
		I don't know?

	A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

				MAN
		Yeah, how much for the silver flask
		there?

				STREET VENDOR
		Well, that's a very special item.  The
		cap itself is one hundred percent
		plappium.  It's a value is over three
		thousand dollars.

				MAN
		Really.  Where's it from?

				NICKY
		It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
		himself and is only to be used for the
		capture and containment of my blood
		brothers so that the firefall of Hades
		will burn brightly once again.

				MAN
		Really.  I think we'll let you keep it
		then.

	He walks away.

				STREET VENDOR
		Okay, now you gone and done it.  You
		done messed with my business bitch!

				NICKY
		Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
		your voice.  It's making my muscles
		tighten.

	We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

				STREET VENDOR
		Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
		I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
		get busy.

	The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
	swinging his fists around.

	Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
	selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
	going on.

	Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

				VALERIE
		Excuse me, does that flask belong to
		this man?

				STREET VENDOR
			(frustrated)
		Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

				VALERIE
		Look, I know you come out here and sell
		stolen stuff all the time.  But today,
		the guy you stole from just happened to
		walk by and bust you.  So why don't you
		admit today's not your day and give him
		his flask back?

				STREET VENDOR
		Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly
		me to death?

				VALERIE
		No, but maybe that cop over there might
		have something to say.

	Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor
	ponders this for a second, then...

				STREET VENDOR
		Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
			(looking at Valerie)
		And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
		and find a new corner.  Before I show
		you what real crazy is.

	The vendor does crazy eyes again.

				VALERIE
		Fine.  I will.

	Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

				NICKY
		Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a
		few years.

	Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
	follows her.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You
		didn't have to do that.

				VALERIE
		That's okay.  I get messed with all the
		time and when I saw him doing that to
		you I just lost it.  I hate when people
		take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it
		for the rest of us.

				NICKY
		You think I'm a tourist?

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent
		maybe.  Where are you from?

				NICKY
		The South.

				VALERIE
		Really?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  Deep south.
			(laughs hard)

	She laughs along with him, not sure why.

				VALERIE
		Why are you laughing?

				NICKY
		I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your
		glasses are nice.  They make your eyes
		look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look
		at them.

				VALERIE
		My dad's an optometrist.

				NICKY
		My dad's in hell, and he's falling
		apart.

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your
		parents get older.

				NICKY
		If I don't save him, I don't know what
		I'm gonna do.

				VALERIE
		Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
		you will figure something out.

	Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
	hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

				NICKY
		Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick
		ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

				VALERIE
		That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I
		actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

				NICKY
		Could I come with you to getting a
		Gelati?

				VALERIE
		If you want to.

				NICKY
		Want to?  A million angry octopus people
		couldn't hold me back!

				VALERIE
		"Octopus people?"

				NICKY
		Uh, it's a deep south expression.

	Nicky laughs.

	EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

	They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

				NICKY
		It's freezing my hands.

				VALERIE
		It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap
		it.

	Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just
	then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,
	sensing Nicky.

				PREACHER
		Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
		Your evil is stinking up our streets!
		We're all gonna die!

	He takes off running right into a lamp post.

				VALERIE
		This town is really going to hell
		lately.
			(Nicky nods)
		So what part of the city do you live in?

				NICKY
		I have an apartment.  I don't remember
		exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

				VALERIE
			(laughs)
		You have a dog?  What kind?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's
		uptown talking to his contacts.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

	Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

				BEEFY
		Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
		it's the motion of the ocean.

				GIRL DOG
		Just finish.

	EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

				VALERIE
		I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to
		school full time.  It wouldn't be fair
		to the dog.

				NICKY
		School?

				VALERIE
		Parsons School of Design.  I knew
		growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
		I put my energy into making things that
		are pretty.

				NICKY
		What's that pleasant smell coming from,
		your skin?

				VALERIE
		My perfume?

	He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
			(laughs)
		It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
		Which I think is the French word for
		coconuts.

	Nicky stops and looks at her.

				NICKY
		Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
		of butterflies flapping around in my
		stomach.  Is that normal?

				VALERIE
		Sometimes, sure.

				NICKY
		Good.  I was concerned.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud
	wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

				GATEKEEPER
		Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I
		hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

	The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
	biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

	PAN TO LUCIFER

	Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
	fire/pond.

				LUCIFER
		You know, I was the one who created
		Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		I know, your wickedness.

				LUCIFER
		I started slow, though.  For years, I
		was just giving people hot foots.
		Actually, you can give all the credit
		for Hell to my first wife; she was the
		inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.
		One day, she asked me if I wanted super
		sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

	The Monster laughs really hard.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,
		you look like her mother, except she had
		more hair.

	The Monster laughs even harder.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		You know what was in Hell when I came
		down here, Cassius?

				GATEKEEPER
		It's Stanley, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.
		Looked like a giant parking lot.  It
		wasn't even called Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		What was it called, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Boogerland!

				GATEKEEPER
		That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you
		just enjoy the fishing?

				LUCIFER
		I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.
		I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I
		catch everything...

	We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
	fishing line to:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

	We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A
	giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head
	is sticking out.

				PEEPER
		I deserve this!

	EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

	Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

				KID
		I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
		bar.

				KID #2
		How many beers did you have?

				KID # 3
		Eight sips.

				KID
		I had five!  I'm so wasted.

	They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN
	sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
	of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

				ADRIAN
		When an adult goes to Hell, that's
		terrific.  But when a child goes...
		that's why I'm in this business.

	Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
	Valerie.  He's shocked.

	Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
	collection.

				NICKY
		So you're saying, make all pants with a
		drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
		have to feel humiliated by telling their
		waist size in front of the whole store?

				VALERIE
		Basically, yeah.

				NICKY
		Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring
		socks for gals with fat ankles.

	Valerie laughs.

				VALERIE
		You know what's nice about you?  You
		just seem happy being yourself.  You
		don't try to act cool.

				NICKY
		Thanks much.  You know what's nice about
		you, Valerie?

				VALERIE
		What?

	Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's
	been stunned by something.

				NICKY
		Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

				VALERIE
		What was that?

				NICKY
			(shocked and confused)
		I...I don't know why I just said that.
		I meant to say that...

					 QUICK CUT TO:

	Adrian's eyes flashing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		...I've always wanted to have sex with a
		gross pig.  What do you say we go behind
		that dumpster, pull our pants down and
		see what happens?

	Valerie's very hurt.

				VALERIE
		You're a jerk.

	She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
	His inner voice speaks to him.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		ADRIAN!

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		You shouldn't have come here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Please, get out of my mind!

	Adrian's eyes flash.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Valerie!

	She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
	Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,
	giving her the "finger."

				VALERIE
		What the hell's your problem?

	She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
	across the street.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
		Dad's sick.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He's sick?

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you
		guys left, you broke the gates.  We
		gotta get the gates burning again before
		he dies.

	Adrian processes this.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He should have thought of that before he
		denied me my birthright.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Well maybe you should go back and talk
		it over with him.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		How about this?  I stay here enjoying my
		Schnapps and you go back.

	Nicky's body jerks around.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, please...

	Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
	crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
	truck bearing down on him.

	JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks
	down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

				PETER
		Check this out.  The number of the
		beast.

	They laugh and hi-five.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	INT. CBS EVENING NEWS PROGRAM

	Dan Rather speaks to the camera.  Over his shoulder we see a

	up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script.)

				DAN RATHER
		Reverberations from Arch-Decon
		Donnelly's shocking speech are still

	A few CATS are down in the aisle physically pushing around
	shocked audience members.

	BACK ON DAN RATHER

				REGIS
		So I was driving to work today, and some
		bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...

				KATHY LEE
		Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

				REGIS
		So I followed him...

				KATHY LEE
		You followed him?

				REGIS
		I followed him all the way downtown, and
		when he gets out of the car, I reach
		under my seat and pull out an aluminum
		bat.

				KATHY LEE
		You keep a bat under your seat?

				REGIS
		Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this
		guy, and start bashing his brains in
		with this bat, and it made me feel
		happy!  Did you ever see THE
		UNTOUCHABLES?

				KATHY LEE
		Yes, great movie...

				REGIS
		I was DeNiro!

	The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying.  The TV turns off.
	We PULL BACK to see that we are in.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Your brothers are upsetting the balance
		of good and evil.

				NICKY
		What can I do about it?

				BEEFY
		You can't do jack shit... unless you
		learn your evil powers.

				NICKY
		Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those
		dudes put the wick in wicked.

				BEEFY
		Go get a soda out of the fridge.

				NICKY
		But those are my roommate's sodas...

				BEEFY
			(high-pitched mocking)
		"But those are my roommate's sodas..."
		Does that sound like a statement the son
		of the devil would make?

	Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
	on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
	at the Coke.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		You have the power to change the cola in
		that can into any other liquid - engine
		oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just
		have to release the evil within you.

				NICKY
		Release the evil?

				BEEFY
		I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
		you... I can tell from your snores.

	Nicky stares at the can.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Release your evil...

	Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

				TODD
		What are you doing?

	Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire
	escape.

	*******************

				TODD (CONT'D)

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

				BILL WALTON
		What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse
		85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
		run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
		seem to be struggling to find their
		groove in front of their hometown fans.

	A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
	makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
	GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and
	makes the travelling signal.

				REF
		He's walking, get him a bus!

				BILL WALTON
		Oh, another awful call.  There is no way
		that was travelling.

	Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

				CORNROWS
		What's with all these crazy calls?  You
		gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
		game in 53 years.

				REF
		Technical foul!

	Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY
		That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
		fingers like someone I know...

	ON TV

	The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
	slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		It looks like the work of a brother...

				TODD
		A black guy?

				NICKY
		If it's Cassius, yes.

	Nicky races for the door.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

	As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's

				GLOBETROTTER FAN
		Get your head out your ass, ref!  The

				REF
		Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
		Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
		in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten

	The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.

	ON STANDS

	The KIDS are crying.

	The halftime buzzer sounds.  The Globetrotters walk off the

		In all my years of basketball, I was
		never so happy to hear a halftime
		buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second

		full scale riot.

	A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

				COURT ANNOUNCER
		It's time for the Globetrotter's
		halftime half-court heave throw, where
		one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
		thousand dollars!

	A brick lands at the announcer's feet.

	Bill Walton's hair is on fire.

		I think that ball just blew up.  And

	CUT AWAY DURING DEVIL YELL TO:

	SHOT CLOCK

	It reads: 666.

	Popcorn and sodas EXPLODE.

	Cornrow's cornrows POP open into a GIANT AFRO.

	BACK ON NICKY

	Nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the
	Exorcist).  He ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous
	dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces.  He hits
	the ref on the way down.  The crowd CHEERS, finally happy
	again.

				NICKY
		Never doubt my skills.

	INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

				CORNROWS
		Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.

	MID-COURT

	Nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor,
	covered in glass.  He gets up slowly

				REF
		That's nuts.  When'd you learn that
		shit?

				NICKY
		Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super
		devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I
		might need it for just such an occasion.

				REGIS
		Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's
		go best two out of three.

				NICKY
			(pulls out the flask)
		No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for
		me.

	The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks.

	Cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the
	ref's mouth and into the bottle.  WHOOSH!  The ref slumps to
	the floor.

	STANDS

	Still quiet until John and Peter rush to Nicky and bow.

	COURTSIDE

	Nicky peers into the flask.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Damn you, Nicky!  There ain't no super
		devil juice in here!

	Nicky caps the flask.  Nicky waves to the stunned, but
	appreciative crowd.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A homemade cake is laid out.  It reads: CONGRATULATIONS,
	NICKY.  JOHN, TODD, PETER AND BEEFY are there.

				TODD
		So your father's the devil, you're a
		talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys
		are who?

				PEEPER
		Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and
		the work his Dad does.

				JOHN
		By the way, Nicky.  Check this out.

	He spins his Black Sabbath backwards.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		What's Ozzy trying to say there?

				NICKY
		Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always
		came straight with his messages.  But
		wrap your minds around this one.

	Nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi.  He pus
	on a James Taylor album and plays it backwards.

				VOICE
		I command you in the name of the Lucifer
		to spread the blood of the innocent.

	John and Peter look at each other, shocked.

				JOHN
		No wonder your uncle's so weird...

				TODD
		I gotta say this cake tastes a little
		funny.

				PETER
		Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the
		mix.  Tried to spice up the bash.

	Nicky takes a big bite of cake.

				NICKY
		What's reefer?

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. APARTMENT - LATER

	PAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.  Everyone's laughing
	hard.

				JOHN
		Come on.  One more time.

				NICKY
		Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts.

				PETER
		Please.  You got to.

				NICKY
			(resigned)
		All right...

	Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360
	degrees.  Everyone cracks up, high fives.  Even Todd LAUGHS.
	PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes.

				BEEFY
		I used to get baked like this with my
		first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so
		stoned she would forget I was a dog.

				JOHN
		She was human?

				BEEFY
		Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,
		that pissed my parents off.

				JOHN
		I dated a Japanese girl once.  My
		parents disapproved.  Not cause she's
		Japanese, but cause she was only
		fifteen.

				NICKY
		I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.

	Everyone cracks up.

				TODD
		I was in love one time but she said I
		wasn't financially reliable enough.  And
		she needed that.

				JOHN
		By she, do you mean he?

				TODD
		No.

				BEEFY
		Busted.
			(laughs)

				PETER
		How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul
		Jabar?

				NICKY
		A little strange.  I can't stop thinking
		about this girl, Valerie.

				TODD
		Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss
		her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?

				JOHN
		Easy, Liberace.

				TODD
		Oh, would you grow up.

				NICKY
		We had the greatest afternoon of my life
		until Adrian made me tell her she had a
		heart-shaped ass.

				BEEFY
		Maybe you love her.  But what do I know?
		I'm baked out of my mind.

				PETER
		Me, too.  We're gonna get going.

				TODD
		You guys want to stay?  I have a futon
		in my bedroom.

				JOHN
		That's a big pass, Elton John.

				PETER
		We're going to see Ozzy play at the
		Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come,
		Nicky?

				NICKY
		No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be
		able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

				JOHN
		Whoa, that chick must be the real deal,
		then.  Later on.

				NICKY
		See ya, fellas.

	They leave.

				BEEFY (O.S.)
		You better snap out of it soon, kid.
		Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow.
		Seven AM.  Nighty, night.

	He falls asleep and starts snoring.  We hear the SOUND of
	THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he
	exhales.

				TODD
		That is the most frightening thing I
		have ever seen.

	Nicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly
	over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him,
	we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.

				NICKY
		Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School
		of Design?

	EXT. PARSON'S SCHOOL OF DESIGN - NIGHT

	Nicky walks around the corner.

	SIGN READS: "Parson's School -  Student Housing"

	Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms.  He looks up.
	Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent.

				NICKY
			(he sniffs)
		Coconuts...

	Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb.  His nose
	leads him.  He reaches the window, sniffing heavily.

	INT. DORM ROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

	A STUDENT is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling
	his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "Silence of
	the Lambs."  The student is startled.

				STUDENT
		Hello.

				NICKY
		You smell like coconuts.

				STUDENT
		It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me
		feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda
		what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?

				NICKY
		No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named
		Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

				STUDENT
		Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one
		window over.

				NICKY
		Thanks, much.  Good luck with the
		genital tucking.

				STUDENT
		I don't need luck.  I'm good.

	Nicky floats away.  A few seconds later, he floats back,
	holding up the flask.

				NICKY
		Adrian?

				STUDENT
		Andrew.

	Nicky nods and floats off.

	EXT. VALERIE'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in.

	INT. VALERIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Cool music.  She is up late.  Working by candlelight on a
	fantastic design.  Something's not working.  She drapes a
	beautiful fabric over another.  She smiles at the
	combination.  She is happy being creative.  Nicky feels his
	heart swell as he watches her.

	ON NICKY

	He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  His
	head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the
	beaming Nicky.

				NICKY
		Hey.

				VALERIE
		Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

	Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
	right in Nicky's face.

				NICKY
		Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

	Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

				VALERIE
		What were you thinking coming here?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
		getting blinded with poison.

	He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
	flying over the back rail.

	EXT. VALERIE'S STREET - NIGHT

	We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.  Holding his eyes.

				VALERIE
		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

	Suddenly he stops.  Suspended above ground.  Valerie doesn't
	hear the expected thud.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?

	He floats up, but he can't see.

				NICKY
		Valerie?

				VALERIE
		Are you dead?

				NICKY
		No.

				VALERIE
		What are you doing?

				NICKY
		I think I'm floating.

				VALERIE
		Why would you be floating?

				NICKY
		I don't know.  Maybe it's because of
		your sweet voice.

				VALERIE
		Am I supposed to not be freaked out
		right now?  Because I am.

	He's floating up.  He slows down.

				NICKY
		I can't see you but I can smell you.
		And you make me feel alive in a way I've
		never felt before.

	CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
	The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

				STUDENT
		You got the wrong window again, man.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

	Nicky resumes floating up.

				VALERIE
		I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

	Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes
	still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
	back ten feet.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Look, just because you're floating
		doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
		giving me the finger.

				NICKY
		That wasn't me.  I was being possessed
		by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who
		call you a gross pig.

				VALERIE
		What do you mean, "possessed?"

				NICKY
		Remember when I told you my Dad was in
		Hell?

				VALERIE
		Yes...

				NICKY
		Well, that's because he's the Devil.
		And he wants to keep his throne for
		another ten-thousand years.  Which is
		fine with me, but not with my brothers,
		so they broke out of Hell, causing my
		dad...

				VALERIE
		... "The Devil?"...

				NICKY
		...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad
		very much.  So I came to Earth to save
		him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
		and I met you and...well, my dog tells
		me I just might be in love with you.

	His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is
	totally in shock but still here.

				VALERIE
		Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

	Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		I don't know if I should believe you.

	Nicky starts to drop.

				NICKY
		You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe
		in the butterflies.

				VALERIE
		Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

	He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she
	takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
	flying.

	EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT

	They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

				VALERIE
		This is amazing.

	They soar past some more buildings.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then
	holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.

				PREACHER
		The hellbeast is above us.  He's
		invading our skies!  We're all gonna
		die!  We're all gonna die!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		He's kind of ruining the mood.

				NICKY
		Let me take care of that.

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.

				PREACHER
		We're all gonna die!

	A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.  A powerful blast of
	water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
	the street into a plate glass window.

	EXT. NYC SKY - CONTINUOUS

				VALERIE
		Can we go fly over Central Park?

				NICKY
		Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the
		most beautiful thing I could possibly
		imagine.

	EXT. OVER THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

	They fly over it, away from NYC.

				VALERIE
		We're going to Jersey?

				NICKY
		East Rutherford.

	EXT. MEADOWLANDS - NIGHT

	They float high above the Meadowlands.  There is an outdoor
	concert going on.  OZZFEST.
	We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.
	Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

				NICKY
		I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
		until he was dead.
			(he looks at her)
		Please tell me you like metal.

				VALERIE
			(sings along to song)
		"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
		head..."

	Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

				NICKY
		My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

	They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter
	look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while
	he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

	Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
	the street.

	He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The
	KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a
	friendly wave.

				NICKY
			(in Korean)
		Moo ya san jie bay!

	The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

	MUSIC CUE:

	A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
	sequence.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky
	looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of
	him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
	teacher and start chasing Nicky.

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP - DAY

	A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about
	going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
	candy bar instead.

	EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

	Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point
	and start wheeling after him.

	EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

	Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

				NICKY
		What's going on here?

	But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
	catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
	last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't
	slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
	bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over
	the edge to see the crash.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
	out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and
	thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

				NICKY
		Ow...what was that for?

				BUM
		Fifty million dollars.

	The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
	And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

	Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
	blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running
	right at him.  He closes his eyes.

				NICKY
		Release the evil.

	Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
	insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

	The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
	immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
	out.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the
	insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
	exhausted Nicky.

				NICKY
		I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a
		look.

				TODD
		Been breaking all morning.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

				DAN RATHER
		At a news conference earlier today,
		Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
		beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
		news.  He revealed that the man who
		caused a sensation at basketball arena
		last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
		a mass murderer.

	We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's
	holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky's outraged.

				NICKY
		I didn't murder anybody

				BEEFY
		Look.  You were really high.  Things
		happen.

				NICKY
		I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is
		Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

				BEEFY
		I think you're looking at him.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
	press to keep him warm.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(on TV)
		This video shows what he did after he
		left the basketball arena yesterday...

	ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY

	Scarface shooting his AK-47.  Nicky's face has been crudely
	superimposed over his.

				GUY
			(Adrian's voice)
		My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
		you suckers for no reason!

	CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"

	ON TV - DAY

	The Chief shakes his head.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Difficult to watch, I know.  In response
		to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
		the largest reward in law enforcement
		history: fifty million dollars to the
		person or persons who bring this man to
		me.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky stands outraged.

				NICKY
		This is baloney!

				BEEFY
		He superimposed your head onto
		"Scarface."

				TODD
		...which is by far DePalma's best
		work...

	A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

	The pounding increases.

				NICKY
		I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't
		live here!

				PETER
		Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

	Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

				JOHN
		There's like a total mob scene coming
		this way.

	We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

				NICKY
		I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

	Todd i s looking out the window.

				TODD
		Looks like they're following a giant
		trail of bug shit.

				PETER
		What'll we do now, Beefy?

				BEEFY
		I don't know, this is a little out of my
		league.

	VOICES GROW LOUDER.

				VOICES (O.S.)
		Come on.  Let's get 'em.

				JOHN
		What would your dad do, Nicky?

				NICKY
		Good idea...kill me.

				PETER
		Dude.  Seriously?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at
		noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

				JOHN AND PETER
			(psyched)
		Alright!

	John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
	counter.  Nicky is dazed.

				NICKY
		That just hurt a lot.

				TODD
		I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can
		I do it?

				JOHN
		Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John
	and Peter watch happily.

				TODD
		Die, Grandma, die!

	Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand
	drops back in.  He's dead.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking
	at his hand.

				LUCIFER
		Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the
		bra.

	The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
	poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we
	see his breasts flop out.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
		two hillbillies were blowing on them.

	The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The
	Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to
	what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one
	ear).

				NICKY
		Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
		me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am
		I gonna do?

				DAD
		What are you gonna do?  Look at me,
		Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I
		got one ear...

	Dad's remaining ear falls out.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		I got no ears!  I can't hear!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?
		Your father's got no ears!

				NICKY
		Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have
		any advice at all for me?

				DAD
		I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear
		anything!

	Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Check one-two.  Check one-two.

				DAD
		Put it back on my head.  I'm falling
		apart here.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
			(putting ear back on Dad)
		You get your ass back up there.  You
		save your father!

	Nicky looks very upset.

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

				PETER
		You sure you're down with this?

				JOHN
		Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

	They approach the cops guarding the door.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Looking for the chief.

				PETER
		We know where to find Nicky.

	COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

	INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

	Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
	the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
	SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		You have what I want?

				JOHN
		Sure do.  You got what we want?

				PETER
		Fifty million bones, bro.

	He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		That's half of it.  You get the rest
		when I get Nicky.

				PETER
		Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.
		He's not human.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Really?

				JOHN
		We think he's the son of Satan.

	PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks
	over and picks them up by their throats.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
		careful.  Now where is he?

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We
	see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
	CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief
	bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

				BAG LADY
		Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you
		are?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(never stopping)
		Emperor of the New Hell.

	They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
	usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke
	comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

				TODD
		Where is he?  He's late.

				BEEFY
		He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,
		kid.

	They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police
	backed up by the huge police force.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		We've been ratted out.

	Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

				TODD
		You guys.  That was so uncool.

				PETER
		We thought the son of Satan would
		understand a move like this.

	Peter and John high-five.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Okay, take these two outside.  I can
		handle this.

	The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead
	their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
	alone with the chief.

				CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
		Wanna see something cool?

	The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits
	his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
	he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.
	The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of
	his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
	chief's body slumps to the ground.

				ADRIAN
		Ta-da.  So what time is my brother
		expected back?

				JOHN
		Noon...

	They look at the clock.  It's noon.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		...ish.

	Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

				PETER
		So even though you're not really the
		chief, we still get the rest of the
		cash, right bro?

				ADRIAN
		You know what you'll get?  An
		indescribably horrific torture
		administered by demons for the rest of
		eternity.

				JOHN
		But what about the cash?  Can we keep it
		or what?

				ADRIAN
		Sure, why not?

	They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot
	down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan
	circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

				LADY
			(mumbling to herself)
		Food stamps?
		They should call 'em "dude stamps."
		Cause ever time I get one, some dude
		takes it away...

	We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
	towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

				LADY (CONT'D)
		Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with
		me for a dollar!

				JOHN
		No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
		of booze.
			(grabs the bottle, laughs)

				LADY
		Hey...that's mine.

	Peter pushes her away.

				PETER
		Beat it, ya freak.

	John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

				JOHN
		Schnapps...

				PETER
			(takes the bag, swigs)
		Peppermint...alright.

	Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is
	actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John
	offers Adrian the flask.

				JOHN
		Wanna hit?

	Hands it to him.  He takes it.

				PETER
		Drink up.  Here's to fifty million
		clams.

				ADRIAN
		To the defilement of Earth and the
		corruption of its people.

				PETER
		Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and
		let's get outta this hell-hole.

	Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
	before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

				ADRIAN
		It is awfully hot down here.  How do you
		manage to stay so cool?

				JOHN
		Weed lowers the body temperature.
			(stuttering)
		I read that...in, uh...er, science
		magazine.

	Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

				ADRIAN
		This liquid will probably quench my
		thirst.  Cool me off.

				PETER
		Definitely.

				JOHN
		And give you a good buzz.

				ADRIAN
		Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
		eternity.

				JOHN
		Uh.  No it won't?

	John starts to tremble a bit.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out
		and say hello...

				JOHN
		Urr...uggg...errr...

				ADRIAN
			(eyes getting red)
		I'm calling you out, brother...

	Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John
	wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

				JOHN/NICKY
		Urrr...uggh...
			(as Nicky)
		Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

	Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
	to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
	the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

				ADRIAN
		Hello, Cassius.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		All right.  Let me out.

				ADRIAN
		You know, New Hell really only needs one
		new Satan.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		You mother...

	Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

				ADRIAN
		But Cassius could use some company for
		the rest of eternity.  So get in the
		flask.

	He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

	The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
	Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy
	raises his leg.

				COP
		Oh, he's gotta pee.

	A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
	group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

				TODD
		Run, Beefy!  Run!

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian stares down Nicky.

				NICKY
		I won't drink.  You can't make me.

	Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over
	to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

	We hear a train coming in the distance.

				ADRIAN
		Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.
			(Nicky is scared)
		Unlike you, she won't come back from
		where she's going.

				NICKY
		Let her go.

				ADRIAN
		I hear a train coming.  Drink.

	The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.
	Nicky raises the flash to drink.

				VALERIE
		Don't do it.

				NICKY
		I have to, Valerie.

	We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
	archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
	ADRIAN'S LEG.

				ADRIAN
		Ahhh!

				BEEFY
		Now that hurt the both of us.

	Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for
	her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the
	tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

				NICKY
		Valerie!!!

	Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
	Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

				ADRIAN
		See you in Hell!

	WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

	INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He
	looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

	Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He
	sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

	Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
	vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

	Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
	cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
	down to him.

	EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After
	a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
	and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
	on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel
	rises.

				ANGEL
		Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're
		here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I
		am so excited right now.

				CHRISTA
		So excited.

				JENNA
		She really is.

				NICKY
		That's terrific.  Now could you ladies
		point me to the Black Palace?  I should
		check in with my dad...

	Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

				ANGEL
		I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

				JENNA
		Do you have any idea where you are right
		now?

				NICKY
		The home of eternal damnation, house of
		Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

				ANGEL
		Maybe try the opposite of that.

	The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
	confused.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Okay, can I just ask you something?
		What do you know about your mom?

				NICKY
		My brothers told me my mother was a
		mountain goat.  Which would explain my
		chronic halitosis.

				ANGEL
			(annoyed)
		A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

				NICKY
		My mom wasn't a goat?

				ANGEL
		Try an angel.

				NICKY
		An angel?

				ANGEL
		Unh-huh.  Which would make you half
		angel.

	Nicky is floored.

				NICKY
		Wow.  What...what did she look like?

				ANGEL
		Well, she was about six-three, only
		spoke Portuguese and had really long
		grey hair.

	The GIRLS start laughing.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
		I'm your mom.

	Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a
	picture of Nicky.

				JENNA
		I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
		look on your face.

				CHRISTA
		You're gonna be so happy she did that.

				NICKY
			(stunned)
		How come you're not older?

				ANGEL
		Angels don't get any older, son.

				JENNA
		I can't believe you just called him
		"son."

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

	They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

	Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
	by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
	Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
	around.

				DAD
		I can't see shit.  You're all still
		here, right?

	Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal
		in a jiffy, sir.

				DAD LIPS
		Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came
		through.

				ADRIAN
		Where's Nicky?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He came with you and Cassius, right?

				ADRIAN
		I came through that gate alone.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry, sir, false alarm.

				DAD
		Boooo.

				ADRIAN
		Somebody explain what's going on.

	Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

				GATEKEEPER
		You'll get nothing out of me.

				ADRIAN
		Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
		lips.

	He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the
	information immediately.

				GATEKEEPER
		The only way to save your dad is for you
		and your brothers to pass through the
		gates at the same time before he
		deteriorates completely.

				ADRIAN
		How much time does Dad have before that
		happens?

	Adrian twists hard.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims
		his throne will have unimaginable power.

	Adrian throws him down.

				LUCIFER
		All boobs and no balls.

				ADRIAN
		Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't
		mind if I take a seat while I wait for
		you.

	He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

				DAD LIPS
		Ahhh!

	He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

				LUCIFER
		I don't get no respect.

				ADRIAN
		Ten thousand years.  And I never once
		got to sit here.

	He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He
	grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Wow.  And this is just a little taste of
		my power.

				DAD
		Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,
		get him out of the chair!

	The demons approach.

				ADRIAN
		Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are
		a couple of million evil souls on Earth
		ready to be harvested.  Anyone
		interested?

	The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

				NICKY
		Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

				CHRISTA
		No, their mother's weren't angels.

				ANGEL
		I think they were hookers or strippers
		or something really porno like...

	There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
	Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

				CHUBBS
		Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
		Mambo lesson.

				ANGEL
		Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so
		sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,
		Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

				CHUBBS
		Wow, that's terrific.

				ANGEL
		Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a
		golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
		dance instructor.

				CHUBBS
		You mambo?

				NICKY
		I don't think so.

				CHUBBS
		Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's
		all in the hips.

	Chubbs dances as he leaves.

				NICKY
		Where did you meet my father?

				ANGEL
		It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
		and Hell mixer.

				CHRISTA
		I remember that night, you had like four
		daiquiris.

				ANGEL
		Try four and a half.  At first I totally
		didn't like him.

				JENNA
		He was really conceited.

				ANGEL
		But I don't know, he was funny, he made
		me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
		had a really nice body.

				NICKY
		And that made you want to make a baby
		with him?

	The Angels laugh.

				ANGEL
		Well, I really wasn't thinking about
		making a baby at the time!

	Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
		don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
		perv!  I'll call you back...
			(laughs)
		Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
		goodbye.
			(hangs up)
		That was my friend, Michelle, she says
		"hi."

				NICKY
		Well tell her I said "hi" back.

	Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

				ANGEL
		I'll call her later.

				CHRISTA
		You know, we saw you save your
		girlfriend's life.

				JENNA
		That was so cool.

				ANGEL
		That's why you came up to Heaven instead
		of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically
		gets you here.

				NICKY
		How did you see me?

				ANGEL
		We can see what's going on anywhere on
		Earth.  Look.

	Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
	front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
	reflection of Earth below.

	EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

	People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance
	stores...

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		All these good people have totally been
		led astray.

				CHRISTA (O.S.)
		Show him Central Park.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

	People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large
	circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
	fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
	jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators
	exchange money.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		There's like a three day rave goin' on
		down there.  No on is going to work
		anymore.

	Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
	on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm
	around him.

				ADRIAN
		Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to
		see all of you here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did
		Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		Let's see...

				     RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

				DAD LIPS
		I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were the best Devil, boss, the best
		Devil!

				GATEKEEPER
		Absolutely.

				DAD LIPS
		I tried to do some interesting stuff...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You did amazing stuff!

				GATEKEEPER
		I don't know how you came up with some
		of it.

				DAD LIPS
		Really?  That means a lot to me.

				JENNA (O.S.)
		Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		I can't believe I did it with him.

	She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

	EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

	Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
	HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

				ADRIAN
		I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to
		sin with minimal prompting.

	The crowd cheers.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		You're acting as if there is no Heaven
		or Hell.

	The crowd cheers.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

	We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
	flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted
	harness that looks like underwear.

				ADRIAN
		Well, I have some news.

	Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

				CARDINAL
		There is most definitely a Hell!  And
		you're all going there when you die!
		Which will happen in about fifteen
		minutes.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
	and they get scared.
	The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
	the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

				PREACHER
		We really are gonna die!

	This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
	run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

				PETER
		This don't look good.

				JOHN
		Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
		us out of this?

				TODD
		They castrated him.  He can't shoot
		arrows, he can't piss smoke.

				BEEFY
		I can't screw.
			(whimpers)
		I can't screw.

	Valerie's crying.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is shocked.

				NICKY
		Valerie's crying!

				ANGEL
		She's so nice.

				CHRISTA
		She goes to Parson's, right?

				ANGEL
		I would totally love to go there.  But I
		hear it's really hard to get in.

				NICKY
		I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I
		gotta help everybody.

				ANGEL
		Yeah, you do...

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

				ADRIAN (V.O.)
		At the stroke of midnight, my father
		will be completely deteriorated.  And
		all of your souls will be mine.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Soon you will see things more horrible
		than you can even imagine.

	Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is
	thrown.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

	Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
		bring you a dear sweet man and an
		international icon...Henry Winkler!

	A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
	two DEMONS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The scared bad people finally smile.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Covered in bees!

	We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
	of bees.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The crowd gasps.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is starting to panic.

				NICKY
		But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger
		and smarter than me.

				ANGEL
		Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.
		But you have something he doesn't have.

				NICKY
		A speech impediment?

	The girls laugh.

				ANGEL
		No, you have the inner light.  You can
		totally use it.  It's the best power of
		all.
			(he smiles)
		And in case you get in real bad trouble,
		G-d told me to give you this.

	She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

				NICKY
		What is it?

				ANGEL
		I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d
		said when the time comes, you'll know
		what to do.

				CHRISTA
		G-d's so smart.

				JENNA
		The smartest.

				ANGEL
		Well, goodbye...for now.
			(looks at his face)
		Can I just do this?

	She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

				FRIEND
		Totally.

				NICKY
		Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
			(to Angel)
		Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

				ANGEL
		It would be so okay.

	Nicky hugs his Mom.

				NICKY
		Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
		cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
		hurricane.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		You're already there...

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

	Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see
	the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
	him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and
	concentrates.

				NICKY
		Release...the good.

	When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
	the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.
	THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial
	expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the
	butterflies.

	ANGLE ON

	MORE DEMONS keep closing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the good...

	Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see
	fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting
	them.

	The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the awesome.

	...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
	POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of
	chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Put it in your mouth and let it slide
		down your throat-hole.

	The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

				DEMON
		Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

	The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

	Only ten minutes left.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

				TODD
		One thing I really regret is never
		having experimented sexually.

				PETER
		You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
		Burner?  What are you talking about?

				JOHN
		He means getting it on with someone like
		that freak.

	ANGLE ON:

	The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

	BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

				TODD
		His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

				JOHN
		Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

	Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
	butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
	the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden
	light/haze of good around them.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is underneath Valerie.

				ADRIAN
		You know, from this angle, you're kind
		of cute.

				VALERIE
		You think so?  Why don't you come a
		little closer and I'll show you a better
		angle.

	He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.
	Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

				ADRIAN
		Yummy.

	Everyone is grossed out.

				TODD
		Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
		swallowed that spit.

				BEEFY
		That turn you on there, RuPaul?

				ADRIAN
		Keep it up and I just might make you my
		Queen for a night or two.

				JOHN
		You want a queen?  Got one right here.

	John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
	Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
	He looks down to see:

	Nicky standing there with his army.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Little Nicky.

				NICKY
		Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
		name of all that is good: release my
		friends and get in the flask.

				ADRIAN
		Is this a joke?

				NICKY
		No.  It's the inner light.  And with it
		we can defeat anything you've got.

				REFORMED DEMON
			(eating Popeye's chicken)
		It's true!

	Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
	an evil ray.

	The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
	golden insides splatter on the crowd.

	The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
	chicken.

				ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
		It's not true?

	The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
	steps forward bravely.

				NICKY
		Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
		choice.

	Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

	 EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

				NICKY
		Love lifts me up where I belong.

	ANGLE ON

	Crowd reacts.

	ON HELL STAGE

	Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

				ADRIAN
		Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what
		you've got.

	Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
	the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
	chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

	ON CROWD

	The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
	this.

	BACK ON HELL STAGE

	Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
	He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
	baffled chipmunk in one bite.

	Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
	flowers.

	Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
	lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

	Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
	pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

	Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
	leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

	Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
	stops beating her up and holds her hand.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my
		bare hands.

	Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
	platform.

	Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
	when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

	INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

	We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
	watching the action on the table.

				ANGEL
		I totally had to do that.

				ALL THE GIRLS
		Yah you did.

	CHUBBS is there, too.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
	rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
	bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
	down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
	out the flask.

				NICKY
		Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
		flas...

	Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
	sending him flying off the bed.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

	Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
	awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

	Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
	to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
	lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
	down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Now will you get in the flask?

				ADRIAN
		Absolutely not.

	Adrian turns to his demons.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		A little help over here.

	A bunch of Demons advance.

	ON FLAGPOLE

	We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
	over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

	ON ADRIAN

	He looks up and glares at Henry.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Henry!

	ON FLAGPOLE

	Henry's eyes widen.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Oh no.

	He is covered in bees again.

	BACK ON ADRIAN

	He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
	demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
	open his mouth.

	Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
	mouth.

				ADRIAN
		Goodbye, Nicky.

	We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Come on in, bro.

	Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
	the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
	Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
	grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

	As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

				CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
		bust Adrian's head wide open.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		I was going to let you out, eventually,
		Cassius.  I swear.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
		heard him keep saying.

	We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

	All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
	circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
	off the stage.

	We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
	REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
	horrible thud.

				VALERIE
		Nicky!

				NICKY (O.S.)
		That was Cassius!

	The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
	get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
	street.  They root for their side.

				DEMON
		Kill him, Adrian.

	John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	The Angel and the Friend are praying.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
	the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
	their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

	HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
	people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
	The people and demons near him are grossed out.

	Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

				VALERIE
		Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
		fight like that?

				NICKY
		From my dad's side of the family.

	She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
	But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
	air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

	The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
	help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
	her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

				ADRIAN
		What?  No tongue?

	Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

				VALERIE
			(whispering)
		Nicky. Nicky.

	No response.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		You gotta fly out...I know you can do
		it.
			(still no response)
		Do it for the butterflies.

	A long beat, then:

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Butterflies...

	And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
	it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

				OZZY
		Hello, New York.

				JOHN AND PETER
		Ozzy.

	They faint.

	The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
	hands Ozzy the flask.

				VALERIE
		Put him in, Ozzy.

	Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER

	The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The
	FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
	The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
	on their backs crying like babies.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

				JOHN
		He'll never make it.

				PETER
		You gotta kill yourself.

				NICKY
		I'll just go to Heaven.

				BEEFY
		No if you do something bad right before
		you die.

	PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Aw, man, not again.

				NICKY
		Sorry, Henry.
			(focuses)
		Release the Evil.

	Henry is covered in bees once again.

	ON NICKY AND VALERIE

	Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Do me.

				VALERIE
		I love you.

				NICKY
		I love you.

	Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

	ON CLOCK TOWER

	Six seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The lips and finger are slowing down.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
	starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP
	SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

	The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
	now descends quickly into the ground.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The good people of New York cheer.  We see John, Peter, Todd,
	Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
	seductively.

	EXT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is so proud.

				ANGEL
		Okay, you just saw my son save the
		universe.  Right?!

	Everyone cheers.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are hugging.

				DAD
		You came through, Nicky.

				NICKY
		I came through for you, Mom and the
		butterflies, Dad.

				DAD
		You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's
		no butterflies here.  If you want
		butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

				NICKY
		What about you and Grandpa and everyone
		in Hell?

				DAD
		Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
		upon a time and it's never stopped
		hurting.
			(Dad looks up)
		That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm
		still in love with you.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is shocked.

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about
		me.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

				DAD
		And don't think I forgot about how crazy
		you get after a few daiquiris.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

				FRIEND
		That guy is still a horn dog.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad turns to Nicky.

				DAD
		Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got
		up high.  You take care of the middle.

				NICKY
		I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley
		Crue, this will always be my...home
		sweet home...

	He pats him on the back.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
		for Hitler's punishment.

				LUCIFER
		Let me handle that.

	Lucifer walks over to the closet.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

	He pulls out the flask.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		No!

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Don't do it!

	He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

				HITLER
		Holy Schnit!

	FREEZE FRAME, then:

					DISSOLVE TO:

	ONE YEAR LATER

	Over the skyline of Manhattan.

	EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

	PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
	Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.
	Unbelievably happy.

	A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

				LADY
		Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

				VALERIE
		Thank yo.

				LADY
		Such a little angel.

				BEEFY
		Only a quarter, ma'am.

	She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire
	shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

				NICKY
		Zachariah, say you're sorry.

				BABY ZACHARIAH
			(sounds like Nicky)
		Sorry.

	The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
	walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs
	towards us.

				PREACHER
		He has spilled his seed!  He is
		multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the
		unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

	The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.

					    THE END.
FADE IN:

	EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

	A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
	the lights turn on.

				PEEPER
			(whispering)
		Showtime!

	We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
	window.  She is wearing business attire.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		Well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
		use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

	He sips some wine.

	The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Looks like Victoria just told me her
		secret.

	The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
	the words as he goes.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		I will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

	The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
		unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
		getting comfy.

	The son talks to his mother excitedly.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

	The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Now what.  This simply won't do.

	The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
	answers.

				SCOTTIE
		Hello?

				PEEPER
		Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.

				SCOTTIE
		Who is this?

				PEEPER
		Just a little birdie.  A birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.

				MOTHER
		Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
		our tree?

	The peeper gets nervous.

				PEEPER
		Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
	shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
	to the ground with a thud.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
		wear your bikini.

	The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

					   HARD CUT:

	INT. HOLE - DAY

	The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
	all sides.

	The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
	screaming like a five-year old girl.

	PEEPER'S POV

	We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
	peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
	SCREAMS.

	EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

	We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
	We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).

				GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
		Welcome!

	The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
	station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

				PEEPER
		Am I in hell?

				GATEKEEPER
		What do you think?

	A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

	MATTE PAINTING HELL

	MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

	The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
	the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

	Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
	"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

	The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
	NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

				NICKY
			(embarrassed)
		Hey...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your father wants to see you and your
		brothers in the throne room.

				NICKY
		Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

	INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

	ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
	people's faces that are coming through the wall.

				CASSIUS
		I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

				ADRIAN
		I've been waiting on this day for ten
		thousand years.

	He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaah!

				CASSIUS
		If the old man picks me to take over
		Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
		four seven.  No breaks.

				ADRIAN
		Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
		the torture.  You have to let people
		feel a sense of relief.

	Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
	in the eye.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

				ADRIAN
		Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
		is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

	Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

				CASSIUS
		I'll take that.

	Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
	It splatters like a grape.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Was that really necessary?

	Nicky enters sheepishly.

				CASSIUS
		Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
		today?

				NICKY
		Good, thanks.

	Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

				CASSIUS
		Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

	Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

				NICKY
		Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

	Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
	force.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!

				NICKY
			(picking up his head)
		Yes, you got me...

	Nicky's head slams back down again.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya, again!

				NICKY
			(picking head up)
		Got me for sure, yes...

	He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
	head.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

	Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
	own crotch.

				NICKY
		Oh no.  Please Cassius...

	Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
	until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Aaaaah.

	Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
	hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
	notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
	devil horns), enters behind them.

				DAD
		What are you boys doing?

	Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

				NICKY
		Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
		furniture.

				DAD
		Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
		of your brother's mind?

				CASSIUS
		I forgot.

				DAD
		Maybe this will help you remember.

	Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
	nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
	floor.

	Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
	confidence and power.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		Now everybody sit down.

				NICKY
		Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
		down my monsters of metal compilation
		tape.  I really think it's a
		masterpiece.

				DAD
		Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

	He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
	window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
	head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
	closes the curtains.

	Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
	his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
	of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
	his three sons.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
		thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
		here in hell for ten thousand years.
		And after this ten thousand years had
		passed, he decided to abdicate his
		throne...

	Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		...to step aside.
			(Nicky lowers his hand)
		...and let me become the ruler of hell.
		This, as some of you might know, is my
		ten thousandth year as Prince of
		Darkness.  So I think the time has come
		to discuss who will succeed me.

	Jimmy the Demon walks in.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Knock, knock.

				DAD
		Yes, Jimmy.

	He whispers in Dad's ear.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
		keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
		go.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
			(turning to leave)
		Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
		pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
		o'clock.

	Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
	back to his sons.

				DAD
		This was a very difficult decision,
		because I have three wonderful sons.  I
		mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
		And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
		Nicky, so...so...

				NICKY
		Don't worry about coming up with
		anything.  It's cool.

				DAD
		Such a sweet boy.  But after much
		thought and careful consideration, I've
		decided that the ruler for the next ten
		thousand years is going to have to
		be...me.

				CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
			(dumbfounded)
		What!?

				NICKY
		Hallelujah.

	They all look at Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I mean...tough break.

				DAD
		The important thing for the stability of
		our rule is to maintain the balance
		between good and evil.  And I don't
		think any of you are ready for that
		responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
		that comes only with the passage of
		time.

				CASSIUS
		Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

	Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
	Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
	tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

				DAD
		Right.  Right.  Send him in.
			(to the boys)
		I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
		to work.

	Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

				ADRIAN
		You sure about this decision, Dad?

				DAD
		I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
		thing to do.

	HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
	Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

	Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
	a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
	over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
	Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
	Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

	CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

	As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

				HITLER
		Holy schnit!!

	EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

	Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
	looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

				CASSIUS
		You work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.

				ADRIAN
		And he's dead serious.

				CASSIUS
		It's just such a slap in the face.

	Adrian turns to the Monster.

				ADRIAN
		Um, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.

				CASSIUS
		Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

	Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
	The Monster shrugs and walks off.

				ADRIAN
		Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
		Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
		getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
		need a place where we can rule.

	Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

				CASSIUS
		Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
		on!! Let's see what you got!

	The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

				CASSIUS (CONT'D)
		That's what I thought!

				ADRIAN
			(to Cassius)
		Could you concentrate for five seconds?

				CASSIUS
		I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

				ADRIAN
		What do you think about...Earth?

	Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		We could create our own hell there.

				CASSIUS
		You saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?

				ADRIAN
		Eventually, Cassius.  But first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...

				CASSIUS
		...their damned souls will be ours.

				ADRIAN
		It's our time, brother.

	The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
	fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey, what are you doing?!?

	They get closer to the fire.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You can't go through there.  The fire
		flows in, not out.

	They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You know something?  You guys suck!  You
		really suck!

	Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
	hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
	tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
	Pause.  Dad exhales.

				DAD
		Now that was an experience.  "You are
		only coming through in waves."  That
		line blows my mind every time.

				NICKY
		Definitely.

				DAD
		I don't care what kind of mood you're in
		at the start of that song.  When it's
		over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
		Great shit.  What's next?

				NICKY
		Well, I thought that after messing with
		your head, I'd give you a little kick in
		the keester.

	Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

				DAD
		Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

				NICKY
		Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

				DAD
		I was just playing with you.

	Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	CLOSE ON DAD.

				DAD
		I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
		I regretfully have to decline.

	ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

				DAN
		C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
		Superbowl ring.

				DAD
		In exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, Mr.
		Marino.

				DAN
		You did it for Namath.

				DAD
		Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
		Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
		records and the Hall of Fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.

				DAN
		This is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
		with or without you!

				DAD
		Now you're talking.

	Dan exits.

				NICKY
		You're a good devil, Dad.

				DAD
		And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

	Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.

				GATEKEEPER
		Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
		escaped from hell.  They went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  I think
		they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.

				DAD
		Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
		your knees.

	The Gatekeeper stands up.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  You're the man.  You've always
		been the man.

	Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
	only see them from the front for a second.
	From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to Nicky.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
			(to Nicky)
		I'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?

				NICKY
		Coulda been much worse.

				GATEKEEPER
		That's what I'm thinkin'...

	Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

				DAD
		This is bad, Nicky.

				NICKY
		How bad?

				DAD
		I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means I'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

				LUCIFER
		What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

				DAD
		Everything's fine, pop.

				LUCIFER
		Last time you said that the renaissance
		happened.

				DAD
		Please, pop, just go back to your room.

				LUCIFER
			(regarding gateskeeper)
		Can I take him with me and have sex with
		his head?

				DAD
		Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

	The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

				GATEKEEPER
		Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

	We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
	SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

	The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

				DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
		What's going on?  Where are we?

	We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Nothing's getting through that.  The
		fire is solid as a rock.

				NICKY
		We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		Ideas?

				DAD
		To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
		come back through the other way.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Dad!

				DAD
		I'm too weak.  The process has already
		begun.

	Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
	see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Jimmy!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
		devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.

				NICKY
		You're not saying it's up to me?

	The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I've never been to Earth.  I've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
		in you.

				DAD
		Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on Earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.

				NICKY
		Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
		and kill my brothers?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Not go.  They left together at the exact
		same time.  They gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

				DAD
		Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	The Monster gags.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your ol' man's got less than a week.

	Nicky looks petrified.

				NICKY
		No.  This can't be happening.

				DAD
		Son, just do your best.

	Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
	who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

	Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

	PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
	two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
	surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
	distance.

				NICKY
		Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
		doesn't look too bad.

	Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
	WHAMMM!

			EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
	the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were gone ten seconds.  What
		happened?

				NICKY
		I got hit by a big light that was
		attached to a lot of metal.

				DAD
		That's a train, son.  Don't stand in
		front of them.

				NICKY
		Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
		a mulligan on this one.

				DAD
		Please, Nicky, get back up there.
			(his ear falls off)
		Try to hurry.

	Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
	In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
	scrawled "NICKY."

	Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

				NICKY
		I'm Nicky.

	Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

				BEEFY
			(voice of Sandy Wernick)
		Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
		and come with me, shitstains.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

	The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

				BEEFY
		My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
		your father's.  He's asked me to help
		you out.

				NICKY
		I just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
		can possess people.  So they probably
		won't look like themselves.  You have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

				NICKY
		Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
		right on in there.

				BEEFY
		It's not me, moron.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry.

	EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
	money in his pot.

				PREACHER
		Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		He thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
		The Lord loves you...

	We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
	sniffs.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		The Lord does not love you.  I
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
		   face)
		You make the Lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		I'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		The Devil walks among us!

	He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

	He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
	disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Makin' friends already.

				NICKY
			(shivering a little)
		It's freezing up here, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
		you some warm clothes.

				NICKY
		I also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

				BEEFY
		That pain is hunger.

	EXT. BENCH - DAY

	K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
	an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
	is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
	CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

				NICKY
		So far, so good.  Now what?

				BEEFY
		Put it in your mouth.

	Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Move your teeth up and down.

	Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
		head back and let the meat slide down
		your throat-hole.

	Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

				NICKY
		Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

				BEEFY
		It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
		gonna need your energy.

				NICKY
		I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
		get cracking!

	NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
	into the path of a moving bus.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
	gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
	enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
	the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

	The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
	embarrassed.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey.

				NICKY
		That's a pretty brassiere.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks.

				NICKY
		Could you maybe not tell anyone about
		this?

				GATEKEEPER
		You got it.  Could you maybe not tell
		anyone about this?

				NICKY
		You got it.

	Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
	back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
	love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
	(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

	Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
	cautious.

				NICKY
		From now on.  I'm just going to avoid
		all moving metal objects.

				BEEFY
		Great.  Now your father gave me some
		deposit money for a nice pad on the
		Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

	Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
	is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
	dancing for him.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET

	Nicky and Beefy.

				BEEFY
		So I found this other joint for you.
		But you're gonna have a roommate.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

				TODD
			(on phone)
		I know exactly how you feel... The night
		Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
		"Is this man going to blow up the world,
		Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		Somebody's here.  Call you later.

	Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
	his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

				NICKY
		Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the Village
		Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?

				TODD
		Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
	nod imperceptibly.

				NICKY
		Yes.  What is rent?

				TODD
		Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
		Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
		my scene partner so the living room will
		be off limits.

				NICKY
		Off limits.

				TODD
		Right.  And as far as household items:
		we can share the soap, but we'll split
		the cost 60/40.
		Cause the person who physically goes out
		and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
		as much as the other guy.
			(looks at Nicky)
		Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

				NICKY
		No.

				TODD
		It's like eighty degrees in this
		hallway.  You from the South?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  The deep South.

	Nicky laughs a little too hard.

				TODD
		Why is that funny?

				NICKY
		I don't know.

				TODD
		And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

	Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

				BEEFY
		You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day
		tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep
		thing I told you about.

				NICKY
		Got ya.
			(to Todd)
		Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

				TODD
		Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

	The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
	reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
	it.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM

	Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
	clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
	familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
	hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

	SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
	looking concerned.

	EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

	We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
	large church.

	INT. CATHEDRAL

	CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
	steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
	We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
	gins his homily.

				CARDINAL
		In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of Heaven... or something like
		that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
		the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
		Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
		done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
		Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
		given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
		He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
		us.

	A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		The Lord gave my son the strength to get
		off drugs.

				CARDINAL
		Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
		he was better off on drugs.  He's a
		bore.  At least when he was smoking
		hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

	A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

				YOUNG MAN
		After we tried for many years, the Lord
		finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

				CARDINAL
		No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
		wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
		do anything for you?

	The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

				MAYOR
			(standing)
		Well, I wish I could think of something,
		Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
		can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a Lord.  If there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.

				CARDINAL
		Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

	The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
	Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Oh, this is delicious.

	ON MAYOR

	He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
			(laughing)
		"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
		one.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Well, we must get people sinning if we
		want to fill up our New Hell.  How are
		things going down at City Hall?

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		I lowered the drinking age to ten.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
		never want it to end.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

	The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

	Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
	same.

				NICKY
		This is intense!  And it happens every
		day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my
		hat to you people!

				BEEFY
		Look, it's okay for me to shit the
		street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

				NICKY
			(pulling up pants)
		Okay, just point me in the right
		direction next time.

				BEEFY
		Come on, there's like ten million people
		in this city and the clock is ticking.

				NICKY
		Well, let's rock and roll.

	Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
	DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
	him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
		You froze the gate and you're killing
		him.  Drink!

	Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

				CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
		I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

				NICKY
		just get in the flask!

	The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
	to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
		the head is gonna make me throw in the
		towel?  Well, in the immortal words of
		Judas Priest, "You got another thing
		comin'."

	Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
	bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
	long lense, real people, real reactions.)

	INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

	Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
	Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
	Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
	ordering some chicken.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
	his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
	it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
	to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
	grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
	Nicky as he walks away.

	INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

	Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
	polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
	flask.

	INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
	The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

				GATEKEEPER
		Bus?

				NICKY
		Beast.

	The Monster laughs.

				GATEKEEPER
			(to Monster)
		You like that?  You think that's funny?

	The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		How about that?  You like that?

	The Monster howls with delight.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
	Popeye's drumstick.

				NICKY
		All that running and chasing is making
		the sleep thing want to come early.

				BEEFY
		I think we have to work on narrowing
		down our list of suspects.  Now I'm
		going to go check in with some of my
		contacts uptown.

	Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
	Beefy sighs.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
		begging to come out...

	Beefy walks away.

	EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

	Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
	snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

	ON WORRIED PEOPLE

	Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
	GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
	goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
	it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

				PETER
		Sounds like our devil dance actually
		worked this time.

				JOHN
		'Bout time...

	Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
	worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
	Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

	Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		There's our man.

				PETER
		Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
		to the dark side.

	A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
	the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

				JOHN
		What's with that guy?

				PETER
		Gotta be one of his disciples or
		something.

	Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
	drumstick) and runs off.

				JOHN
		Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
		ripped off.

				PETER
		Should we wake him up?

				JOHN
		Yeah.  You do it.

	Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
	SNORT.

				PETER
		Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude
		just stole your shit.

	Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

				NICKY
		Oh nooooo....

	Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Which way did he go?

				JOHN
		That way.

	Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

				NICKY
		Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
		phenomenal.

	He runs off.

				PETER
		Did you check out the dragon mouth?

				JOHN
		The Dark Prince is here.

	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

	Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past
	several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
	sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
	sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
	blanket of the VENDOR.

				NICKY
		Hey...

				STREET VENDOR
		See something you like, my man?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I would like my flask back.

	The street vendor stands, very angry.

				STREET VENDOR
		You callin' me a thief, my man?

				NICKY
		No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
		has my flask.

				STREET VENDOR
		And if that is your so-called "flask,"
		how would I have it unless I was, in
		fact, a thief?

				NICKY
			(not sure what the answer is)
		I don't know?

	A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

				MAN
		Yeah, how much for the silver flask
		there?

				STREET VENDOR
		Well, that's a very special item.  The
		cap itself is one hundred percent
		plappium.  It's a value is over three
		thousand dollars.

				MAN
		Really.  Where's it from?

				NICKY
		It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
		himself and is only to be used for the
		capture and containment of my blood
		brothers so that the firefall of Hades
		will burn brightly once again.

				MAN
		Really.  I think we'll let you keep it
		then.

	He walks away.

				STREET VENDOR
		Okay, now you gone and done it.  You
		done messed with my business bitch!

				NICKY
		Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
		your voice.  It's making my muscles
		tighten.

	We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

				STREET VENDOR
		Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
		I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
		get busy.

	The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
	swinging his fists around.

	Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
	selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
	going on.

	Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

				VALERIE
		Excuse me, does that flask belong to
		this man?

				STREET VENDOR
			(frustrated)
		Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

				VALERIE
		Look, I know you come out here and sell
		stolen stuff all the time.  But today,
		the guy you stole from just happened to
		walk by and bust you.  So why don't you
		admit today's not your day and give him
		his flask back?

				STREET VENDOR
		Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly
		me to death?

				VALERIE
		No, but maybe that cop over there might
		have something to say.

	Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor
	ponders this for a second, then...

				STREET VENDOR
		Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
			(looking at Valerie)
		And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
		and find a new corner.  Before I show
		you what real crazy is.

	The vendor does crazy eyes again.

				VALERIE
		Fine.  I will.

	Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

				NICKY
		Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a
		few years.

	Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
	follows her.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You
		didn't have to do that.

				VALERIE
		That's okay.  I get messed with all the
		time and when I saw him doing that to
		you I just lost it.  I hate when people
		take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it
		for the rest of us.

				NICKY
		You think I'm a tourist?

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent
		maybe.  Where are you from?

				NICKY
		The South.

				VALERIE
		Really?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  Deep south.
			(laughs hard)

	She laughs along with him, not sure why.

				VALERIE
		Why are you laughing?

				NICKY
		I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your
		glasses are nice.  They make your eyes
		look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look
		at them.

				VALERIE
		My dad's an optometrist.

				NICKY
		My dad's in hell, and he's falling
		apart.

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your
		parents get older.

				NICKY
		If I don't save him, I don't know what
		I'm gonna do.

				VALERIE
		Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
		you will figure something out.

	Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
	hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

				NICKY
		Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick
		ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

				VALERIE
		That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I
		actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

				NICKY
		Could I come with you to getting a
		Gelati?

				VALERIE
		If you want to.

				NICKY
		Want to?  A million angry octopus people
		couldn't hold me back!

				VALERIE
		"Octopus people?"

				NICKY
		Uh, it's a deep south expression.

	Nicky laughs.

	EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

	They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

				NICKY
		It's freezing my hands.

				VALERIE
		It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap
		it.

	Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just
	then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,
	sensing Nicky.

				PREACHER
		Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
		Your evil is stinking up our streets!
		We're all gonna die!

	He takes off running right into a lamp post.

				VALERIE
		This town is really going to hell
		lately.
			(Nicky nods)
		So what part of the city do you live in?

				NICKY
		I have an apartment.  I don't remember
		exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

				VALERIE
			(laughs)
		You have a dog?  What kind?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's
		uptown talking to his contacts.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

	Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

				BEEFY
		Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
		it's the motion of the ocean.

				GIRL DOG
		Just finish.

	EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

				VALERIE
		I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to
		school full time.  It wouldn't be fair
		to the dog.

				NICKY
		School?

				VALERIE
		Parsons School of Design.  I knew
		growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
		I put my energy into making things that
		are pretty.

				NICKY
		What's that pleasant smell coming from,
		your skin?

				VALERIE
		My perfume?

	He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
			(laughs)
		It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
		Which I think is the French word for
		coconuts.

	Nicky stops and looks at her.

				NICKY
		Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
		of butterflies flapping around in my
		stomach.  Is that normal?

				VALERIE
		Sometimes, sure.

				NICKY
		Good.  I was concerned.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud
	wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

				GATEKEEPER
		Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I
		hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

	The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
	biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

	PAN TO LUCIFER

	Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
	fire/pond.

				LUCIFER
		You know, I was the one who created
		Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		I know, your wickedness.

				LUCIFER
		I started slow, though.  For years, I
		was just giving people hot foots.
		Actually, you can give all the credit
		for Hell to my first wife; she was the
		inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.
		One day, she asked me if I wanted super
		sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

	The Monster laughs really hard.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,
		you look like her mother, except she had
		more hair.

	The Monster laughs even harder.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		You know what was in Hell when I came
		down here, Cassius?

				GATEKEEPER
		It's Stanley, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.
		Looked like a giant parking lot.  It
		wasn't even called Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		What was it called, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Boogerland!

				GATEKEEPER
		That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you
		just enjoy the fishing?

				LUCIFER
		I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.
		I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I
		catch everything...

	We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
	fishing line to:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

	We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A
	giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head
	is sticking out.

				PEEPER
		I deserve this!

	EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

	Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

				KID
		I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
		bar.

				KID #2
		How many beers did you have?

				KID # 3
		Eight sips.

				KID
		I had five!  I'm so wasted.

	They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN
	sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
	of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

				ADRIAN
		When an adult goes to Hell, that's
		terrific.  But when a child goes...
		that's why I'm in this business.

	Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
	Valerie.  He's shocked.

	Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
	collection.

				NICKY
		So you're saying, make all pants with a
		drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
		have to feel humiliated by telling their
		waist size in front of the whole store?

				VALERIE
		Basically, yeah.

				NICKY
		Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring
		socks for gals with fat ankles.

	Valerie laughs.

				VALERIE
		You know what's nice about you?  You
		just seem happy being yourself.  You
		don't try to act cool.

				NICKY
		Thanks much.  You know what's nice about
		you, Valerie?

				VALERIE
		What?

	Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's
	been stunned by something.

				NICKY
		Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

				VALERIE
		What was that?

				NICKY
			(shocked and confused)
		I...I don't know why I just said that.
		I meant to say that...

					 QUICK CUT TO:

	Adrian's eyes flashing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		...I've always wanted to have sex with a
		gross pig.  What do you say we go behind
		that dumpster, pull our pants down and
		see what happens?

	Valerie's very hurt.

				VALERIE
		You're a jerk.

	She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
	His inner voice speaks to him.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		ADRIAN!

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		You shouldn't have come here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Please, get out of my mind!

	Adrian's eyes flash.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Valerie!

	She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
	Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,
	giving her the "finger."

				VALERIE
		What the hell's your problem?

	She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
	across the street.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
		Dad's sick.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He's sick?

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you
		guys left, you broke the gates.  We
		gotta get the gates burning again before
		he dies.

	Adrian processes this.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He should have thought of that before he
		denied me my birthright.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Well maybe you should go back and talk
		it over with him.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		How about this?  I stay here enjoying my
		Schnapps and you go back.

	Nicky's body jerks around.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, please...

	Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
	crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
	truck bearing down on him.

	JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks
	down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

				PETER
		Check this out.  The number of the
		beast.

	They laugh and hi-five.

	ON THE TV - DAY

		Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

				REGIS
		So I followed him...

				KATHY LEE
		You followed him?

				REGIS
		I followed him all the way downtown, and
		when he gets out of the car, I reach
		under my seat and pull out an aluminum
		bat.

				KATHY LEE
		You keep a bat under your seat?

				REGIS
		Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this
		guy, and start bashing his brains in
		with this bat, and it made me feel
		happy!  Did you ever see THE
		UNTOUCHABLES?

				KATHY LEE
		Yes, great movie...

				REGIS
		I was DeNiro!

	The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying.  The TV turns off.
	We PULL BACK to see that we are in.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Your brothers are upsetting the balance
		of good and evil.

				NICKY
		What can I do about it?

				BEEFY
		You can't do jack shit... unless you
		learn your evil powers.

				NICKY
		Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those
		dudes put the wick in wicked.

				BEEFY
		Go get a soda out of the fridge.

				NICKY
		But those are my roommate's sodas...

				BEEFY
			(high-pitched mocking)
		"But those are my roommate's sodas..."
		Does that sound like a statement the son
		of the devil would make?

	Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
	on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
	at the Coke.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		You have the power to change the cola in
		that can into any other liquid - engine
		oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just
		have to release the evil within you.

				NICKY
		Release the evil?

				BEEFY
		I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
		you... I can tell from your snores.

	Nicky stares at the can.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Release your evil...

	Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

				TODD
		What are you doing?

	Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire
	escape.

				TODD (CONT'D)

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

				BILL WALTON
		What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse
		85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
		run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
		seem to be struggling to find their
		groove in front of their hometown fans.

	A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
	makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
	GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and
	makes the travelling signal.

				REF
		He's walking, get him a bus!

				BILL WALTON
		Oh, another awful call.  There is no way
		that was travelling.

	Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

				CORNROWS
		What's with all these crazy calls?  You
		gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
		game in 53 years.

				REF
		Technical foul!

	Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY
		That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
		fingers like someone I know...

	ON TV

	The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
	slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		It looks like the work of a brother...

				TODD
		A black guy?

				NICKY
		If it's Cassius, yes.

	Nicky races for the door.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

	As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's
	shirt yells out.

				GLOBETROTTER FAN
		Get your head out your ass, ref!  The
		kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

				REF
		Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
		Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
		in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten
		points off for the Globetrotters.

	The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.

	ON STANDS

	The KIDS are crying.

	ON COURT

	The halftime buzzer sounds.  The Globetrotters walk off the
	court.  The crowd BOOS.

				BILL WALTON
		In all my years of basketball, I was
		never so happy to hear a halftime
		buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second
		half doesn't get any better, I expect a
		full scale riot.

	A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

				COURT ANNOUNCER
		It's time for the Globetrotter's
		halftime half-court heave throw, where
		one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
		thousand dollars!

	A brick lands at the announcer's feet.

		Trying to capture his brother in a flask
		and preserve the balance of good and

		Did you just talk?

				BEEFY
		No.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS

		Okay, too much evil..

	Bill Walton's hair is on fire.

				BILL WALTON
		I think that ball just blew up.  And
		yes, my hair is aflame.

			(turning to sideline)
		Could I get another ball?

	The court announcer throws out another ball.  Nicky stares at
	it again with red eyes.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I command you not to blow up and go into
		that metal circle.

	Nicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the
	air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere
	and swats it away.

				REF
		Get that crap outta here!

	The crowd BOOS!  Nicky and the ref stare at each other.

		Alright, how about this?  I get one more

	dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then

		She was human?

				BEEFY
		Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,

		I dated a Japanese girl once.  My

	He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  His
	head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the
	beaming Nicky.

				NICKY
		Hey.

				VALERIE
		Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

	Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
	right in Nicky's face.

				NICKY
		Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

	Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

				VALERIE
		What were you thinking coming here?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
		getting blinded with poison.

	He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
	flying over the back rail.

	EXT. VALERIE'S STREET - NIGHT

	We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.  Holding his eyes.

				VALERIE
		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

	Suddenly he stops.  Suspended above ground.  Valerie doesn't
	hear the expected thud.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?

	He floats up, but he can't see.

				NICKY
		Valerie?

				VALERIE
		Are you dead?

				NICKY
		No.

				VALERIE
		What are you doing?

				NICKY
		I think I'm floating.

				VALERIE
		Why would you be floating?

				NICKY
		I don't know.  Maybe it's because of
		your sweet voice.

				VALERIE
		Am I supposed to not be freaked out
		right now?  Because I am.

	He's floating up.  He slows down.

				NICKY
		I can't see you but I can smell you.
		And you make me feel alive in a way I've
		never felt before.

	CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
	The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

				STUDENT
		You got the wrong window again, man.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

	Nicky resumes floating up.

				VALERIE
		I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

	Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes
	still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
	back ten feet.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Look, just because you're floating
		doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
		giving me the finger.

				NICKY
		That wasn't me.  I was being possessed
		by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who
		call you a gross pig.

				VALERIE
		What do you mean, "possessed?"

				NICKY
		Remember when I told you my Dad was in
		Hell?

				VALERIE
		Yes...

				NICKY
		Well, that's because he's the Devil.
		And he wants to keep his throne for
		another ten-thousand years.  Which is
		fine with me, but not with my brothers,
		so they broke out of Hell, causing my
		dad...

				VALERIE
		... "The Devil?"...

				NICKY
		...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad
		very much.  So I came to Earth to save
		him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
		and I met you and...well, my dog tells
		me I just might be in love with you.

	His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is
	totally in shock but still here.

				VALERIE
		Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

	Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		I don't know if I should believe you.

	Nicky starts to drop.

				NICKY
		You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe
		in the butterflies.

				VALERIE
		Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

	He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she
	takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
	flying.

	EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT

	They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

				VALERIE
		This is amazing.

	They soar past some more buildings.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then
	holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.

				PREACHER
		The hellbeast is above us.  He's
		invading our skies!  We're all gonna
		die!  We're all gonna die!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		He's kind of ruining the mood.

				NICKY
		Let me take care of that.

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.

				PREACHER
		We're all gonna die!

	A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.  A powerful blast of
	water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
	the street into a plate glass window.

	EXT. NYC SKY - CONTINUOUS

				VALERIE
		Can we go fly over Central Park?

				NICKY
		Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the
		most beautiful thing I could possibly
		imagine.

	EXT. OVER THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

	They fly over it, away from NYC.

				VALERIE
		We're going to Jersey?

				NICKY
		East Rutherford.

	EXT. MEADOWLANDS - NIGHT

	They float high above the Meadowlands.  There is an outdoor
	concert going on.  OZZFEST.
	We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.
	Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

				NICKY
		I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
		until he was dead.
			(he looks at her)
		Please tell me you like metal.

				VALERIE
			(sings along to song)
		"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
		head..."

	Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

				NICKY
		My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

	They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter
	look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while
	he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

	Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
	the street.

	He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The
	KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a
	friendly wave.

				NICKY
			(in Korean)
		Moo ya san jie bay!

	The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

	MUSIC CUE:

	A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
	sequence.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky
	looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of
	him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
	teacher and start chasing Nicky.

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP - DAY

	A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about
	going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
	candy bar instead.

	EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

	Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point
	and start wheeling after him.

	EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

	Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

				NICKY
		What's going on here?

	But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
	catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
	last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't
	slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
	bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over
	the edge to see the crash.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
	out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and
	thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

				NICKY
		Ow...what was that for?

				BUM
		Fifty million dollars.

	The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
	And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

	Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
	blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running
	right at him.  He closes his eyes.

				NICKY
		Release the evil.

	Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
	insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

	The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
	immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
	out.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the
	insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
	exhausted Nicky.

				NICKY
		I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a
		look.

				TODD
		Been breaking all morning.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

				DAN RATHER
		At a news conference earlier today,
		Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
		beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
		news.  He revealed that the man who
		caused a sensation at basketball arena
		last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
		a mass murderer.

	We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's
	holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky's outraged.

				NICKY
		I didn't murder anybody

				BEEFY
		Look.  You were really high.  Things
		happen.

				NICKY
		I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is
		Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

				BEEFY
		I think you're looking at him.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
	press to keep him warm.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(on TV)
		This video shows what he did after he
		left the basketball arena yesterday...

	ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY

	Scarface shooting his AK-47.  Nicky's face has been crudely
	superimposed over his.

				GUY
			(Adrian's voice)
		My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
		you suckers for no reason!

	CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"

	ON TV - DAY

	The Chief shakes his head.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Difficult to watch, I know.  In response
		to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
		the largest reward in law enforcement
		history: fifty million dollars to the
		person or persons who bring this man to
		me.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky stands outraged.

				NICKY
		This is baloney!

				BEEFY
		He superimposed your head onto
		"Scarface."

				TODD
		...which is by far DePalma's best
		work...

	A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

	The pounding increases.

				NICKY
		I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't
		live here!

				PETER
		Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

	Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

				JOHN
		There's like a total mob scene coming
		this way.

	We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

				NICKY
		I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

	Todd i s looking out the window.

				TODD
		Looks like they're following a giant
		trail of bug shit.

				PETER
		What'll we do now, Beefy?

				BEEFY
		I don't know, this is a little out of my
		league.

	VOICES GROW LOUDER.

				VOICES (O.S.)
		Come on.  Let's get 'em.

				JOHN
		What would your dad do, Nicky?

				NICKY
		Good idea...kill me.

				PETER
		Dude.  Seriously?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at
		noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

				JOHN AND PETER
			(psyched)
		Alright!

	John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
	counter.  Nicky is dazed.

				NICKY
		That just hurt a lot.

				TODD
		I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can
		I do it?

				JOHN
		Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John
	and Peter watch happily.

				TODD
		Die, Grandma, die!

	Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand
	drops back in.  He's dead.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking
	at his hand.

				LUCIFER
		Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the
		bra.

	The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
	poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we
	see his breasts flop out.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
		two hillbillies were blowing on them.

	The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The
	Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to
	what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one
	ear).

				NICKY
		Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
		me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am
		I gonna do?

				DAD
		What are you gonna do?  Look at me,
		Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I
		got one ear...

	Dad's remaining ear falls out.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		I got no ears!  I can't hear!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?
		Your father's got no ears!

				NICKY
		Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have
		any advice at all for me?

				DAD
		I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear
		anything!

	Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Check one-two.  Check one-two.

				DAD
		Put it back on my head.  I'm falling
		apart here.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
			(putting ear back on Dad)
		You get your ass back up there.  You
		save your father!

	Nicky looks very upset.

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

				PETER
		You sure you're down with this?

				JOHN
		Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

	They approach the cops guarding the door.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Looking for the chief.

				PETER
		We know where to find Nicky.

	COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

	INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

	Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
	the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
	SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		You have what I want?

				JOHN
		Sure do.  You got what we want?

				PETER
		Fifty million bones, bro.

	He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		That's half of it.  You get the rest
		when I get Nicky.

				PETER
		Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.
		He's not human.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Really?

				JOHN
		We think he's the son of Satan.

	PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks
	over and picks them up by their throats.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
		careful.  Now where is he?

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We
	see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
	CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief
	bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

				BAG LADY
		Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you
		are?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(never stopping)
		Emperor of the New Hell.

	They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
	usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke
	comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

				TODD
		Where is he?  He's late.

				BEEFY
		He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,
		kid.

	They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police
	backed up by the huge police force.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		We've been ratted out.

	Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

				TODD
		You guys.  That was so uncool.

				PETER
		We thought the son of Satan would
		understand a move like this.

	Peter and John high-five.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Okay, take these two outside.  I can
		handle this.

	The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead
	their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
	alone with the chief.

				CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
		Wanna see something cool?

	The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits
	his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
	he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.
	The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of
	his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
	chief's body slumps to the ground.

				ADRIAN
		Ta-da.  So what time is my brother
		expected back?

				JOHN
		Noon...

	They look at the clock.  It's noon.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		...ish.

	Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

				PETER
		So even though you're not really the
		chief, we still get the rest of the
		cash, right bro?

				ADRIAN
		You know what you'll get?  An
		indescribably horrific torture
		administered by demons for the rest of
		eternity.

				JOHN
		But what about the cash?  Can we keep it
		or what?

				ADRIAN
		Sure, why not?

	They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot
	down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan
	circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

				LADY
			(mumbling to herself)
		Food stamps?
		They should call 'em "dude stamps."
		Cause ever time I get one, some dude
		takes it away...

	We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
	towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

				LADY (CONT'D)
		Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with
		me for a dollar!

				JOHN
		No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
		of booze.
			(grabs the bottle, laughs)

				LADY
		Hey...that's mine.

	Peter pushes her away.

				PETER
		Beat it, ya freak.

	John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

				JOHN
		Schnapps...

				PETER
			(takes the bag, swigs)
		Peppermint...alright.

	Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is
	actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John
	offers Adrian the flask.

				JOHN
		Wanna hit?

	Hands it to him.  He takes it.

				PETER
		Drink up.  Here's to fifty million
		clams.

				ADRIAN
		To the defilement of Earth and the
		corruption of its people.

				PETER
		Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and
		let's get outta this hell-hole.

	Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
	before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

				ADRIAN
		It is awfully hot down here.  How do you
		manage to stay so cool?

				JOHN
		Weed lowers the body temperature.
			(stuttering)
		I read that...in, uh...er, science
		magazine.

	Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

				ADRIAN
		This liquid will probably quench my
		thirst.  Cool me off.

				PETER
		Definitely.

				JOHN
		And give you a good buzz.

				ADRIAN
		Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
		eternity.

				JOHN
		Uh.  No it won't?

	John starts to tremble a bit.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out
		and say hello...

				JOHN
		Urr...uggg...errr...

				ADRIAN
			(eyes getting red)
		I'm calling you out, brother...

	Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John
	wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

				JOHN/NICKY
		Urrr...uggh...
			(as Nicky)
		Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

	Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
	to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
	the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

				ADRIAN
		Hello, Cassius.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		All right.  Let me out.

				ADRIAN
		You know, New Hell really only needs one
		new Satan.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		You mother...

	Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

				ADRIAN
		But Cassius could use some company for
		the rest of eternity.  So get in the
		flask.

	He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

	The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
	Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy
	raises his leg.

				COP
		Oh, he's gotta pee.

	A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
	group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

				TODD
		Run, Beefy!  Run!

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian stares down Nicky.

				NICKY
		I won't drink.  You can't make me.

	Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over
	to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

	We hear a train coming in the distance.

				ADRIAN
		Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.
			(Nicky is scared)
		Unlike you, she won't come back from
		where she's going.

				NICKY
		Let her go.

				ADRIAN
		I hear a train coming.  Drink.

	The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.
	Nicky raises the flash to drink.

				VALERIE
		Don't do it.

				NICKY
		I have to, Valerie.

	We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
	archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
	ADRIAN'S LEG.

				ADRIAN
		Ahhh!

				BEEFY
		Now that hurt the both of us.

	Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for
	her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the
	tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

				NICKY
		Valerie!!!

	Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
	Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

				ADRIAN
		See you in Hell!

	WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

	INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He
	looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

	Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He
	sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

	Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
	vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

	Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
	cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
	down to him.

	EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After
	a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
	and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
	on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel
	rises.

				ANGEL
		Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're
		here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I
		am so excited right now.

				CHRISTA
		So excited.

				JENNA
		She really is.

				NICKY
		That's terrific.  Now could you ladies
		point me to the Black Palace?  I should
		check in with my dad...

	Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

				ANGEL
		I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

				JENNA
		Do you have any idea where you are right
		now?

				NICKY
		The home of eternal damnation, house of
		Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

				ANGEL
		Maybe try the opposite of that.

	The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
	confused.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Okay, can I just ask you something?
		What do you know about your mom?

				NICKY
		My brothers told me my mother was a
		mountain goat.  Which would explain my
		chronic halitosis.

				ANGEL
			(annoyed)
		A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

				NICKY
		My mom wasn't a goat?

				ANGEL
		Try an angel.

				NICKY
		An angel?

				ANGEL
		Unh-huh.  Which would make you half
		angel.

	Nicky is floored.

				NICKY
		Wow.  What...what did she look like?

				ANGEL
		Well, she was about six-three, only
		spoke Portuguese and had really long
		grey hair.

	The GIRLS start laughing.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
		I'm your mom.

	Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a
	picture of Nicky.

				JENNA
		I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
		look on your face.

				CHRISTA
		You're gonna be so happy she did that.

				NICKY
			(stunned)
		How come you're not older?

				ANGEL
		Angels don't get any older, son.

				JENNA
		I can't believe you just called him
		"son."

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

	They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

	Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
	by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
	Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
	around.

				DAD
		I can't see shit.  You're all still
		here, right?

	Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal
		in a jiffy, sir.

				DAD LIPS
		Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came
		through.

				ADRIAN
		Where's Nicky?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He came with you and Cassius, right?

				ADRIAN
		I came through that gate alone.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry, sir, false alarm.

				DAD
		Boooo.

				ADRIAN
		Somebody explain what's going on.

	Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

				GATEKEEPER
		You'll get nothing out of me.

				ADRIAN
		Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
		lips.

	He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the
	information immediately.

				GATEKEEPER
		The only way to save your dad is for you
		and your brothers to pass through the
		gates at the same time before he
		deteriorates completely.

				ADRIAN
		How much time does Dad have before that
		happens?

	Adrian twists hard.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims
		his throne will have unimaginable power.

	Adrian throws him down.

				LUCIFER
		All boobs and no balls.

				ADRIAN
		Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't
		mind if I take a seat while I wait for
		you.

	He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

				DAD LIPS
		Ahhh!

	He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

				LUCIFER
		I don't get no respect.

				ADRIAN
		Ten thousand years.  And I never once
		got to sit here.

	He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He
	grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Wow.  And this is just a little taste of
		my power.

				DAD
		Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,
		get him out of the chair!

	The demons approach.

				ADRIAN
		Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are
		a couple of million evil souls on Earth
		ready to be harvested.  Anyone
		interested?

	The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

				NICKY
		Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

				CHRISTA
		No, their mother's weren't angels.

				ANGEL
		I think they were hookers or strippers
		or something really porno like...

	There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
	Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

				CHUBBS
		Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
		Mambo lesson.

				ANGEL
		Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so
		sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,
		Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

				CHUBBS
		Wow, that's terrific.

				ANGEL
		Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a
		golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
		dance instructor.

				CHUBBS
		You mambo?

				NICKY
		I don't think so.

				CHUBBS
		Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's
		all in the hips.

	Chubbs dances as he leaves.

				NICKY
		Where did you meet my father?

				ANGEL
		It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
		and Hell mixer.

				CHRISTA
		I remember that night, you had like four
		daiquiris.

				ANGEL
		Try four and a half.  At first I totally
		didn't like him.

				JENNA
		He was really conceited.

				ANGEL
		But I don't know, he was funny, he made
		me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
		had a really nice body.

				NICKY
		And that made you want to make a baby
		with him?

	The Angels laugh.

				ANGEL
		Well, I really wasn't thinking about
		making a baby at the time!

	Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
		don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
		perv!  I'll call you back...
			(laughs)
		Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
		goodbye.
			(hangs up)
		That was my friend, Michelle, she says
		"hi."

				NICKY
		Well tell her I said "hi" back.

	Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

				ANGEL
		I'll call her later.

				CHRISTA
		You know, we saw you save your
		girlfriend's life.

				JENNA
		That was so cool.

				ANGEL
		That's why you came up to Heaven instead
		of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically
		gets you here.

				NICKY
		How did you see me?

				ANGEL
		We can see what's going on anywhere on
		Earth.  Look.

	Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
	front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
	reflection of Earth below.

	EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

	People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance
	stores...

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		All these good people have totally been
		led astray.

				CHRISTA (O.S.)
		Show him Central Park.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

	People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large
	circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
	fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
	jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators
	exchange money.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		There's like a three day rave goin' on
		down there.  No on is going to work
		anymore.

	Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
	on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm
	around him.

				ADRIAN
		Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to
		see all of you here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did
		Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		Let's see...

				     RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

				DAD LIPS
		I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were the best Devil, boss, the best
		Devil!

				GATEKEEPER
		Absolutely.

				DAD LIPS
		I tried to do some interesting stuff...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You did amazing stuff!

				GATEKEEPER
		I don't know how you came up with some
		of it.

				DAD LIPS
		Really?  That means a lot to me.

				JENNA (O.S.)
		Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		I can't believe I did it with him.

	She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

	EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

	Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
	HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

				ADRIAN
		I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to
		sin with minimal prompting.

	The crowd cheers.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		You're acting as if there is no Heaven
		or Hell.

	The crowd cheers.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

	We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
	flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted
	harness that looks like underwear.

				ADRIAN
		Well, I have some news.

	Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

				CARDINAL
		There is most definitely a Hell!  And
		you're all going there when you die!
		Which will happen in about fifteen
		minutes.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
	and they get scared.
	The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
	the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

				PREACHER
		We really are gonna die!

	This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
	run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

				PETER
		This don't look good.

				JOHN
		Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
		us out of this?

				TODD
		They castrated him.  He can't shoot
		arrows, he can't piss smoke.

				BEEFY
		I can't screw.
			(whimpers)
		I can't screw.

	Valerie's crying.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is shocked.

				NICKY
		Valerie's crying!

				ANGEL
		She's so nice.

				CHRISTA
		She goes to Parson's, right?

				ANGEL
		I would totally love to go there.  But I
		hear it's really hard to get in.

				NICKY
		I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I
		gotta help everybody.

				ANGEL
		Yeah, you do...

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

				ADRIAN (V.O.)
		At the stroke of midnight, my father
		will be completely deteriorated.  And
		all of your souls will be mine.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Soon you will see things more horrible
		than you can even imagine.

	Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is
	thrown.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

	Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
		bring you a dear sweet man and an
		international icon...Henry Winkler!

	A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
	two DEMONS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The scared bad people finally smile.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Covered in bees!

	We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
	of bees.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The crowd gasps.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is starting to panic.

				NICKY
		But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger
		and smarter than me.

				ANGEL
		Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.
		But you have something he doesn't have.

				NICKY
		A speech impediment?

	The girls laugh.

				ANGEL
		No, you have the inner light.  You can
		totally use it.  It's the best power of
		all.
			(he smiles)
		And in case you get in real bad trouble,
		G-d told me to give you this.

	She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

				NICKY
		What is it?

				ANGEL
		I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d
		said when the time comes, you'll know
		what to do.

				CHRISTA
		G-d's so smart.

				JENNA
		The smartest.

				ANGEL
		Well, goodbye...for now.
			(looks at his face)
		Can I just do this?

	She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

				FRIEND
		Totally.

				NICKY
		Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
			(to Angel)
		Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

				ANGEL
		It would be so okay.

	Nicky hugs his Mom.

				NICKY
		Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
		cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
		hurricane.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		You're already there...

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

	Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see
	the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
	him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and
	concentrates.

				NICKY
		Release...the good.

	When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
	the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.
	THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial
	expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the
	butterflies.

	ANGLE ON

	MORE DEMONS keep closing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the good...

	Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see
	fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting
	them.

	The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the awesome.

	...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
	POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of
	chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Put it in your mouth and let it slide
		down your throat-hole.

	The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

				DEMON
		Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

	The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

	Only ten minutes left.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

				TODD
		One thing I really regret is never
		having experimented sexually.

				PETER
		You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
		Burner?  What are you talking about?

				JOHN
		He means getting it on with someone like
		that freak.

	ANGLE ON:

	The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

	BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

				TODD
		His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

				JOHN
		Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

	Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
	butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
	the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden
	light/haze of good around them.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is underneath Valerie.

				ADRIAN
		You know, from this angle, you're kind
		of cute.

				VALERIE
		You think so?  Why don't you come a
		little closer and I'll show you a better
		angle.

	He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.
	Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

				ADRIAN
		Yummy.

	Everyone is grossed out.

				TODD
		Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
		swallowed that spit.

				BEEFY
		That turn you on there, RuPaul?

				ADRIAN
		Keep it up and I just might make you my
		Queen for a night or two.

				JOHN
		You want a queen?  Got one right here.

	John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
	Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
	He looks down to see:

	Nicky standing there with his army.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Little Nicky.

				NICKY
		Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
		name of all that is good: release my
		friends and get in the flask.

				ADRIAN
		Is this a joke?

				NICKY
		No.  It's the inner light.  And with it
		we can defeat anything you've got.

				REFORMED DEMON
			(eating Popeye's chicken)
		It's true!

	Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
	an evil ray.

	The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
	golden insides splatter on the crowd.

	The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
	chicken.

				ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
		It's not true?

	The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
	steps forward bravely.

				NICKY
		Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
		choice.

	Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

	 EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

				NICKY
		Love lifts me up where I belong.

	ANGLE ON

	Crowd reacts.

	ON HELL STAGE

	Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

				ADRIAN
		Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what
		you've got.

	Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
	the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
	chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

	ON CROWD

	The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
	this.

	BACK ON HELL STAGE

	Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
	He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
	baffled chipmunk in one bite.

	Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
	flowers.

	Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
	lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

	Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
	pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

	Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
	leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

	Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
	stops beating her up and holds her hand.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my
		bare hands.

	Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
	platform.

	Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
	when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

	INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

	We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
	watching the action on the table.

				ANGEL
		I totally had to do that.

				ALL THE GIRLS
		Yah you did.

	CHUBBS is there, too.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
	rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
	bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
	down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
	out the flask.

				NICKY
		Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
		flas...

	Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
	sending him flying off the bed.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

	Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
	awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

	Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
	to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
	lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
	down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Now will you get in the flask?

				ADRIAN
		Absolutely not.

	Adrian turns to his demons.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		A little help over here.

	A bunch of Demons advance.

	ON FLAGPOLE

	We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
	over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

	ON ADRIAN

	He looks up and glares at Henry.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Henry!

	ON FLAGPOLE

	Henry's eyes widen.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Oh no.

	He is covered in bees again.

	BACK ON ADRIAN

	He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
	demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
	open his mouth.

	Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
	mouth.

				ADRIAN
		Goodbye, Nicky.

	We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Come on in, bro.

	Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
	the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
	Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
	grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

	As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

				CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
		bust Adrian's head wide open.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		I was going to let you out, eventually,
		Cassius.  I swear.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
		heard him keep saying.

	We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

	All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
	circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
	off the stage.

	We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
	REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
	horrible thud.

				VALERIE
		Nicky!

				NICKY (O.S.)
		That was Cassius!

	The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
	get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
	street.  They root for their side.

				DEMON
		Kill him, Adrian.

	John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	The Angel and the Friend are praying.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
	the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
	their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

	HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
	people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
	The people and demons near him are grossed out.

	Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

				VALERIE
		Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
		fight like that?

				NICKY
		From my dad's side of the family.

	She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
	But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
	air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

	The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
	help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
	her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

				ADRIAN
		What?  No tongue?

	Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

				VALERIE
			(whispering)
		Nicky. Nicky.

	No response.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		You gotta fly out...I know you can do
		it.
			(still no response)
		Do it for the butterflies.

	A long beat, then:

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Butterflies...

	And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
	it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

				OZZY
		Hello, New York.

				JOHN AND PETER
		Ozzy.

	They faint.

	The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
	hands Ozzy the flask.

				VALERIE
		Put him in, Ozzy.

	Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER

	The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The
	FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
	The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
	on their backs crying like babies.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

				JOHN
		He'll never make it.

				PETER
		You gotta kill yourself.

				NICKY
		I'll just go to Heaven.

				BEEFY
		No if you do something bad right before
		you die.

	PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Aw, man, not again.

				NICKY
		Sorry, Henry.
			(focuses)
		Release the Evil.

	Henry is covered in bees once again.

	ON NICKY AND VALERIE

	Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Do me.

				VALERIE
		I love you.

				NICKY
		I love you.

	Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

	ON CLOCK TOWER

	Six seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The lips and finger are slowing down.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
	starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP
	SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

	The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
	now descends quickly into the ground.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The good people of New York cheer.  We see John, Peter, Todd,
	Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
	seductively.

	EXT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is so proud.

				ANGEL
		Okay, you just saw my son save the

	Everyone cheers.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are hugging.

				DAD
		You came through, Nicky.

				NICKY
		I came through for you, Mom and the
		butterflies, Dad.

				DAD
		You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's
		no butterflies here.  If you want
		butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

				NICKY
		What about you and Grandpa and everyone
		in Hell?

				DAD
		Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
		upon a time and it's never stopped
		hurting.
			(Dad looks up)
		That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm
		still in love with you.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is shocked.

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad turns to Nicky.

				DAD
		Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got
		up high.  You take care of the middle.

				NICKY
		I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley
		Crue, this will always be my...home
		sweet home...

	He pats him on the back.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
		for Hitler's punishment.

				LUCIFER
		Let me handle that.

	Lucifer walks over to the closet.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

	He pulls out the flask.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		No!

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Don't do it!

	He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

				HITLER
		Holy Schnit!

	FREEZE FRAME, then:

					DISSOLVE TO:

	ONE YEAR LATER

	Over the skyline of Manhattan.

	EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

	PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
	Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.
	Unbelievably happy.

	A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

				LADY
		Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

				VALERIE
		Thank yo.

				LADY
		Such a little angel.

				BEEFY
		Only a quarter, ma'am.

	She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire
	shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

				NICKY
		Zachariah, say you're sorry.

				BABY ZACHARIAH
			(sounds like Nicky)
		Sorry.

	The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
	walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs
	towards us.

				PREACHER
		He has spilled his seed!  He is
		multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the
		unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

	The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.

					    THE END.
"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive Barker

 

	TITLE SEQUENCE


	As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY


	A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.

	EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

	Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.

	END CREDITS.

				CUT WIDE TO;

	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

	A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

	We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

	BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

	The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

	The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

	A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

				NIX
		And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...

				CULTISTS
			(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

	Butterfield enters. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	Nix looks up.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Swann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
	SOBBING.

				NIX
		Hush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

				NIX
		I said hush.

				GIRL
		Please.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

				NIX
			(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

				NIX
			(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.

				GIRL
		Keep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

				GIRL
		Please... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?

				NIX
		You don't like him, do you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		He wants your magic.

				NIX
		Maybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

				GIRL
		What are you going to do?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

	The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

				SWANN
			(to all three)
		Are we ready?

				JENNIFER
			(cool)
		Say the word.

				PIMM
			(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

				SWANN
		No.  He's gone too far.

				PIMM
		So he took a child.

				JENNIFER
		He'll kill her.

				PIMM
		No he won't.

				SWANN
			(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

				QUAID
		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

				SWANN
		So stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

	Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

				SWANN
			(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

	Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

				1ST MAN
		Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

				QUAID
		I changed my mind.

				1ST WOMAN
		Come and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

				SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
			(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

	INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

	Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

				JENNIFER
		Don't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

				BARBARA
		I'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.

				PIMM
		He's going to kill us all...

				JENNIFER
		Where did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

				QUAID
		Stay the fuck away!
			(yells)
		Pimm!  Get over here!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

				SWANN
		You're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.

				NIX
		I knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.

				NIX
		I've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do
		is...beg.

				SWANN
		Fuck you.

				NIX
		You don't think I've got it to
		give?

				SWANN
		No!

	Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

				NIX
		You're wrong.

	He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

				NIX
		I could eat your fucking soul,
		Swann.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
	from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
	hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

				JENNIFER
		Fuck!

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

				NIX
		You want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

				NIX
		Want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Aah!

				QUAID
		Get away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
	open, and enters.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

				QUAID
		Swann?

				NIX
			(to Quaid)
		Here he is.

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

				NIX
		Take a look, Swann!  These are your
		friends.

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.

				JENNIFER (V.O.)
		What have you done to him? 

SWANN'S P.O.V.

	of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

				SWANN
		Don't touch me.  He's got... got
		into my head.

				NIX
		You want to be like that, Swann? 
		Mud and shit?

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

	SWANN'S P.O.V. 

	of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

				NIX
		Come here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.

				NIX
			(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

				NIX
			(a roar)
		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.

				SWANN
		Jesus-

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

	Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

				1ST CULTIST
			(with distressing
		confidence)
		You can't kill him.

				2ND CULTIST
		He'll just rise up again!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

				NIX
		Help me!

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

				JENNIFER
		Quickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.

				NIX
			(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?

				SWANN
		Binding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.

				NIX
		Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

				NIX
		Sw

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

				GIRL
			(quietly)
		Is it finished?

				SWANN
		It's finished.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
	their confidence and courage gone. 

	Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
	body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

				PIMM
		Dead?

				QUAID
		Dead.

				PIMM
		What now?

				SWANN
		We bury him so deep no one will
		ever find him.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

	The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
	dashes towards camera, then halts. 

	HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
	into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

	ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

	The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
	gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
	some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
	congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

	ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

	The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
	a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
	it has a certain charm.

	INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

	A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
	host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
	At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
	but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
	name.

				BLONDE GIRL
		How'd you spell that again?

				HARRY
		D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry
		D'Amour.

				BLONDE GIRL
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
		Isn't that French for something?

	ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Yeah.  It's French.

				BLONDE GIRL
		For love, right?

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
			(grinning)
		That's so cool.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

	Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
	shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's
	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

				HARRY
		Yeah?

				BELLBOY
		You haven't paid the cab.  He won't
		give us your bags 'til you pay him.

				HARRY
		How much?

				BELLBOY
		Thirty-five bucks.

				HARRY
		Tell him he can keep them. The
		Bellboy looks puzzled.

				HARRY
		Just kidding.

	Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
	bills.

				HARRY
		I've got my life in there.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
	open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
	of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
	CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
	destruction. 

	ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
	shower.  Starts to undress.

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

	Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
	sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

				HARRY
		Hello, L.A.

				BELLBOY
		Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

				HARRY
		You bet.

	EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
	classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
	ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

	ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
	recorder.

				HARRY
		Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
		got a great sense of humour or he's
		paying her to laugh.
			(looks at hamburger in
		disgust)
		Jesus.

	On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

				HARRY
			(into tape recorder)
		He's finished.

	Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
	tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
	up and gets in.

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

				HARRY
			(into tape)
		Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off
		again.

	He turns the key in the ignition.

				CUT  TO:

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

	In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It
	reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

	ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
	door beside the store window. 

	WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
	side of the street. 

	Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

				HARRY
		Superstitious?

	He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

				TAPERT (V.O.)
		Oh my God!

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.

				MILLER
		Fuckhead.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

				HARRY
		What the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

				HARRY
			(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		What are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

				QUAID
		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?

				QUAID
		Yes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		And are you afraid?

				QUAID
		Yes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

				QUAID
			(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


				HARRY
		You need an ambulance.

				QUAID
			(in pain)
		Too late.  Why are you here? Did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		NO ... I...

	Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

				QUAID
			(quietly)
		My God.

				HARRY
		What?

				QUAID
		You've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

				HARRY
		Yeah.  You could say that.

				QUAID
		You're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  And it's drawn to you.
			(looks at Harry)
		You don't like that.

				HARRY
		Not much.

				QUAID
		You can't change it.  You have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between Heaven and
		Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
		it.

	Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
	pain.

				HARRY
		Hold on.

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

				HARRY
		The Puritan?

				QUAID
		Yes...

				HARRY
		Who is he? 

	Quaid shudders, and dies.

				HARRY
			(softly; sadly)
		Shit.

	He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
	but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

	The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
	through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
	OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

				EDDISON
			(to Harry)
		What were you doing up there?

				HARRY
		I'm a private detective.  I was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  A guy called Tapert.
		Insurance fraud.

				EDDISON
			(writing)
		Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
		Butterfield.

				HARRY
		Tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  He came here to get his palm
		read.

				EDDISON
		What makes you so sure?

				HARRY
			(shrugs)
		I got a file on him two inches
		thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
		This is something else.  Ever heard
		of someone called the Puritan?

				EDDISON
		New one on me.
			(to Officer)
		Okay.  Let's see him.

	OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
	GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

				EDDISON
		Where the fuck is he?

				HARRY
		He got up and walked.

				EDDISON
			(looking up at window)
		After that fall?. He must have
		broken half his bones.

	WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

				HARRY
		I don't think he'd have given a
		shit.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the
	floors.  Very little furniture. 

	Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
	out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

				BUTTERFIELD
		D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
		that name?

				MILLER
		I know him.  I saw him.

	He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
	sighing with pleasure.

				MILLER
		I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got
		possessed and he saved the little
		bastard's life.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's a priest?

				MILLER
		No.  He's just a guy who's got a
		nose for this shit.
			(a beat.  A smirk)
		Like you.

	A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for
	glass.

				BUTTERFIELD 
		I don't want him getting in the
		way.

				MILLER
		He won't. 

	Another silence.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(dreamily)
		We've all of us waited too long to
		have the homecoming spoiled.

				MILLER
		What do you mean, "all of us?"

				BUTTERFIELD
		You didn't think it was just going
		to be you and me?  A lot of people
		believed in Nix. They haven't
		forgotten his promise.

		Death.

		What about death?

	hypnotic eyes.

	He studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

	VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's

	hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in
	a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious. 
	Elegant. 

	He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

	Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

		Probably.

		It's not a bad place.  Warm.

		do with the man you saw murdered.

				HARRY
		Did your husband know Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.  They weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  I
		think Philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

				HARRY
		You don't?

				DOROTHEA
		I think we make our own futures.

	Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

				HARRY
		What's the connection?

				DOROTHEA
			(covering now, but well)
		I don't exactly know. 
		Philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

				HARRY
		Why not?

	Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

				DOROTHEA
		He's a secretive man.

				HARRY
		And you don't ask questions?

				DOROTHEA
		We don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

				HARRY
		Does that mean...?

				DOROTHEA
		We haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

				HARRY
		But obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

				DOROTHEA
		We wouldn't be having this
		conversation if I didn't. Swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	Harry, frowns.

				DOROTHEA
		You don't believe me.

				HARRY
		He's an illusionist.  It's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	Dorothea stares at him. 

				HARRY
		Sorry.  You asked.

				DOROTHEA
		No.  You're right.  He could have
		been something more. Maybe a lot
		more.  But people get lost.  Even
		good people. Too much fame.  Too
		much money,

				HARRY
		Where do I sign? 

	Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

				DOROTHEA
		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Harry.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.

				HARRY
		I'm no bodyguard.

				DOROTHEA
		That's not what I'm asking for. I
		want somebody who can find out what
		Philip saw in those damn cards. 
		And stop it from happening.

				HARRY
		When do you want me to start?

				DOROTHEA
		Come to the show with me. Tonight I
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  They love him.

				HARRY
		Do you?

	The question catches Dorothea off guard.

				DOROTHEA
		I didn't marry him for love, Mr.

		Sure.

	Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches

	The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
	He makes his way inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a

	The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,

	The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
	apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
	blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
		standing on the threshold of a

	A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	The vortex BLAZES -- 

	And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

	Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
	dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
	Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

	A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
	The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
	crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
	sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

				SWANN
		My friends ... come with me...into
		the Great Beyond.

	A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

	The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly.

	ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
	DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
	somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
	It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
	glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
	struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
	the wheel spins faster and faster. 

	Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
	outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
	to his head. 

	ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

	BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
	shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
	wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

	The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
	the swords DROPS. 

	The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

	As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
	carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
	him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
	stop. 

	More GASPS from the audience. 

	ON HARRY, having a -- 

	FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
	The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

				HARRY 
		There's something wrong... 

	ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
	third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
	until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

	ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

	The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
	nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
	dies away in a matter of moments.

	ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

				DOROTHEA
		No. . .

	ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
	wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
	reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

	There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
	sobs of horror.

				1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
		What happened?

				2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
		It's a trick.

				3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
		Somebody help him.

	The curtains start to close.

	ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

				DOROTHEA
			(to Harry)
		I've got to get to him!

	The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
	seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
	One or two are even praying. 

	Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
	against the flood of the exiting crowd.

				HARRY
		Out of the way!  Out of the way!

	He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
	she can duck beneath it.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
	MANAGER at his side.

				VALENTIN
			(to Stage Manager)
		Get then out of here, for God's
		sake --

				STAGE MANAGER
		You heard him!  It's not a fucking
		show!

	He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
	arm.

				STAGE MANAGER
		Who are you?

	Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
	MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
	towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
	enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

				MILLER
		Psst!

	Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

	Butterfield enters.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

				DOROTHEA
			(softly)
		Swann... 

	A DOCTOR appears.

				DOCTOR 
		I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

	The Doctor checks Swann's body.

				DOCTOR
			(to Dorothea)
		I'm sorry...

	Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
	He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

	WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

	It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
	used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
	beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
	and echoing. 

	The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
	FIGURE ducking away.

				HARRY
		Hey!

	He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
	listens for movement. 

	Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

	Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
	nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

				MILLER
		Got you, fucker!

	Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
		Swann? 

	Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

				HARRY
		You did.
			(a beat)
		Didn't you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Why would I do that?

				HARRY
		Beats me.

	Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

				HARRY
		Deep shit? 

	Butterfield hits him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
		I told you --

	Butterfield hits him again.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
			(raises his hand)
		All right.  It was...

	Butterfield comes a little closer.

				HARRY
			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
	Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

	He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
	of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
	TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
	OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
	MECHANISM. 

	Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

	-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
	closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
	The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

	Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
	BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

				HARRY
		Deep shit...

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. 
	Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

				EDDISON
		And this Butterfield guy--

				HARRY
		--vanished.

				EDDISON
			(frustrated sigh)
		Another fucking magician. Jesus.

	Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
	being taken into another office.

				HARRY
		Are you finished with me?

				EDDISON
		For now.  Are you planning to go
		back to New York?

				HARRY
			(watching Dorothea)
		No.  Not yet...

	INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

	Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

				HARRY
		Are they treating you okay?

				DOROTHEA
			(nods)
		I heard what happened.  It looks
		like somebody murdered him.

				HARRY
		I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
		But if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where you'd start.

				HARRY
		Well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

				DOROTHEA
		They won't tell you anything.

				HARRY
		I can be very persuasive.

				DOROTHEA
			(a beat)
		Yes.  I think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		We'd need to talk about your fee.

				HARRY
		Forget the fee.  If I find
		Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  If I don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  Either way... I
		get to spend some time... here.

	The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
	means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

	Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a
	bandage on his cut face, enters.

	INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

	A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
	all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
	WILDER. 

	Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

				HARRY
		Where'd you learn that?

				WILDER
		What?

				HARRY
			(points)
		That.

				WILDER
		At birth.  I don't know you --

				HARRY
		Harry D'Amour.

				WILDER
		I know all the kids coming up. Got
		to stay ahead of the game. But I
		don't know you.

				HARRY
		I'm in from New York.  I came to
		see Swann.

				WILDER
		What a tragedy.  It was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

				HARRY
		Was he taking a lot of risks?

				WILDER
		You don't know the half of it. I'm
		Walter Wilder, by the way.

				HARRY
		Not the Walter Wilder? 

	Walter beams.

				WILDER
		The one and only. 

	He hands Harry a card.

				WILDER
		Want to try?

	Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

				WILDER
		You know Vinovich?

				HARRY
			(not a clue)
		Sure.  Vivovich.

				WILDER
		He knew Swann way back.  He says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

				HARRY
		I'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

				WILDER
		People are pretty cagey.  Who do
		you know?

				HARRY
		For what?

				WILDER
		For an introduction.

				HARRY
		Well... nobody.

	Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

				WILDER
			(magnanimously)
		You do now.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

	The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

	Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is
	knotting a newly-bought tie.

				HARRY
		I only wear ties for funerals.

				WILDER
		You don't get in without one. It's
		like a gentlemen's club for
		illusionists.  Except most of us
		aren't gentlemen.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

	The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
	illusionists' posters. 

	Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
	where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
	audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
	half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
	stairs and towards the bar.

HARRY
		Are they all in the business?

				WILDER
		It's not a business. Harry. It's a
		vocation. 

	Wilder points to a locked door.

				WILDER
		That's what they call the
		Repository.  Every magic secret
		known to man's locked up in that
		room.

				HARRY
		Have you been in?

				WILDER
		No.  There's only three keys.
		Vinovich has got one, of
		course.
			(beat)
		He's a little crazy, by the way. 
		And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
		he's a real charmer.

				CUT TO

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

	Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
	and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
	two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

	In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

				VINOVICH
		It's more than entertainment. We're
		opening people's heads up.  Putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

				BILLY
		But they're fake miracles.

				VINOVICH
		Houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

				HARRY
		You believe that?

				VINOVICH
		I think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

				HARRY
		Heaven and Hell?

	Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

				VINOVICH
		Trickery and divinity.

				HARRY
		Are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

				VINOVICH
		No.  I'm saying they were always
		fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

				HARRY
		So could you walk on water?

				VINOVICH
			(deadly serious)
		I could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

				HARRY
		What about Swann's miracles?

	The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
	smile.

				VINOVICH
		They weren't worth a damn.

				HARRY
			(goading)
		I heard he was the best.

				VINOVICH
		If he was so good why's he so dead?

	Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

				HARRY
		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

				VINOVICH
		Oh, I've got plenty.

				HARRY
		I'd like to hear them. 

	Vinovich rises.

				VINOVICH
		I'm not saying another word.
			(to Wilder)
		You damn fool.  He's a
		journalist.

				HARRY
		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
		you too scared?

				VINOVICH
		He was a freak.  Everything he did
		was tainted.

	Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

				HARRY
		With what?

				VINOVICH
		Evil.  He was evil.
			(to Laura)
		Come on.

	She rises.

				VINOVICH
			(to the rest)
		Say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

				HARRY
		Great accent, by the way.  Is it
		Brooklyn?

				VINOVICH
			(pure Brooklyn)
		Fuck you.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Harry heads to the car.

				BILLY (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
	that he's not being watched.

				BILLY
		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
		sees me talking to you.  He's an
		asshole, but he's a powerful
		asshole.

				HARRY
		They go together.

				BILLY
			(lowered voice)
		I've heard a name.  Someone they
		talk about in whispers.

				HARRY
		Who?

				BILLY
		Nix.

				HARRY
		Nix?

				BILLY
		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

				HARRY
		Who is he?

				BILLY
		I think maybe he taught Swann.
			(hands Harry a card)
		This is me.  See ya around. 

	Billy hurries away.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		... I want somebody who can find
		out what Philip saw in those damn
		cards... 

	Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

				DISSOLVE TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				BUTTERFIELD
		Ever watched a man die?

	The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

				QUAID
		Please... I wasn't there... Ask
		Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared...

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is still asleep.

				CUT TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

	A long silence. 

	SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He picks up the receiver.

				HARRY
		This is D'Amour.
 
           
			CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
	source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry... I know it's late.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

	There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

				HARRY
		That's okay.

	As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
	page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		How did it go today?

				HARRY
		I went up to the Magic Castle. You
		were right.  He didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.

				CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		They were jealous of him.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Why?  Because he had you?

				BACK TO:

	INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

				DOROTHEA
		He... didn't have me..  I told you-

				HARRY
		You didn't marry him for love.

	DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

	She's a little uncomfortable now.

				HARRY
		So why did you marry him?

				DOROTHEA
		That's my business. Harry.

				HARRY
		Just curious.
			(a beat)
		Back to business.  Ever heard of a
		man called Nix?
			(silence)
		Dorothea?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
		know the name.

				HARRY
		What about Jennifer Desiderio?

				DOROTHEA
		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
		go.

				HARRY
		Okay.  I'll keep digging.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		Yes.  You do that.

	She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
	She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
	up the phone again.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
	Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

	CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

	EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
	heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
	Quaid's Waiting Room. 
	It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
	prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
	locks.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  

	Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
	enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
	TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
	Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		If you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
	false bottom.

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Yes...

	In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	He flicks to "D."

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		Desiderio...

	There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
	the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- Valentin!

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		What the fuck are you doing here?

				VALENTIN
		Looking for you.  I tried the
		hotel.

				HARRY
		Why'd you come here?

				VALENTIN
		You're a detective, with no clues. 
		Where else are you going to look? 
		I'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		Here's thirty thousand dollars.

				HARRY
		What for?

				VALENTIN
		A ticket home,

				HARRY
		You didn't hire me.  She did.
		If she wants me off the job, I
		want to hear it from her.

				VALENTIN
		She doesn't want to see you. She's
		had enough pain.  Enough churning
		over the past.  She wants it all
		left alone.

				HARRY
		Left alone?  Somebody's been
		murdered.

				VALENTIN
		Yes.  It's regrettable

				HARRY
		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
		why.

				VALENTIN
		What for?  You need to stay busy?

				HARRY
			(a confession)
		I like to know why things happen.

				VALENTIN
		Why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

				VALENTIN
		Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
		Just leave her alone.  Let her
		heal.

	He glances back at Valentin.

				HARRY
		Lock up, will you?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

	ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

	Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
	building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

	The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

				HARRY
		A Mister Quaid?

				TOFFLER
		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
		saw it on the news. Jennifer
		doesn't know.  And frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

				HARRY
		I won't say anything.

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

	Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
	distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's been with us four years. 
		She was coming on nicely. 
		But just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

				HARRY
		What's her problem?

				TOFFLER
		She has no real grip on reality.

				HARRY
			(a joke)
		Does anybody?

				TOFFLER
			(deadly serious)
		Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
		real and what's not. That's what
		holds us together.

				HARRY
		And what does Jennifer think's
		real?

	They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
	outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

				TOFFLER
			(quietly)
		Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		Jennifer?

	Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

	Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
	the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

				JENNIFER
		Have we met before?

				HARRY
		No.

				JENNIFER
		Only I forget.  They give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... I forget things,

				HARRY
		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
		came because I wanted to know if
		you knew a man called Butterfield.

				JENNIFER
		Maybe... I... don't...

				HARRY
		What about Philip Swann?

				JENNIFER
		I knew Swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		He's a fucking liar.

	A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

				HARRY
		Why's that?

				JENNIFER
		He said he knew how to protect us. 
		But he didn't know anything.  He
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

				HARRY
		What is?

				JENNIFER
			(tears nearing)
		I don't want to think about it. If
		I think about it he'll hear me. 
		He'll find me.

				HARRY
		Swann?

	Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

				JENNIFER
		I told you.  I don't --

	She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

	The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		God no!  Oh God no!

	She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

				NURSE
		Calm down!

	She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
	back.

				JENNIFER
		He's not going to get me!

	She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
		He's not!  He's not!

				HARRY
		Who's not? 

	He catches up with her.

				JENNIFER
		Nix! Nix!

				HARRY
		Is he the Puritan?

				JENNIFER
		Yes! Yes!

				HARRY
		And he's dead?

				JENNIFER
		No.  He's coming back.  He's
		digging his way out!

	The Nurse appears behind Harry.

				NURSE
		I'll take care of her now.

	Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

				NURSE
		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

	The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

				HARRY
		Jennifer!

	She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
	Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

	HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

	Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

				HARRY
		Jesus.

	He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
	His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

				HARRY
			(very quietly)
		Jesus.

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

	The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

	Harry's on the phone.



				HARRY
		I want to speak to Dorothea.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I'm afraid she's not in.

				HARRY
		When will she be in?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin on the phone in the study.

				DOROTHEA
		Who is it?

	Valentin puts the phone down.

				VALENTIN
		Crank call.  I'll get the number
		changed.

				DOROTHEA
		No word from D'Amour?			    

	Valentin shakes his head.

				VALENTIN
		It's better he's gone.  He would
		have done more harm than good.

				DOROTHEA
		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
		so.  Try him again at the hotel.

				VALENTIN
		I left three messages already.

	Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
	and leaves the room.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

				HARRY
			(on phone)
		Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I
		wanted to get into the repository
		at the Magic Castle?

				CUT TO:

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT        

	THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS. 

	PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
	GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
	LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

				HARRY
		You've done this before.

				BILLY
		I've had my moments.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Harry's manipulating the lock.

				BILLY
		I'm sure they'll have this place
		rigged.

				HARRY
		How?

				BILLY
		It'll be something hokey. 

	CLICK! The door opens.

				BILLY
		Houdini'd been proud of you.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

				BILLY
			(impressed)
		Whoa...

	On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
	IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
	while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

				BILLY
		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

				HARRY
		You heard right.

				BILLY
		You ever been married?

				HARRY
		Yeah.  She was killed in a car
		crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
		was filing for divorce.

				BILLY
		Why?

				HARRY
		My life was too weird for her.

				BILLY
			(grinning)
		I love weird.

	Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

				HARRY
		Billy?  This was on Miller's
		forehead.  Any idea what it is?

				BILLY
		Nope.

	Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

				BILLY
		What did I tell you?  So fucking
		hokey.

	Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

				HARRY
		What have we got here?

	Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

				HARRY
		Grab the files!

	Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
	steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
	CLANG!

				BILLY
		Jesus!

	He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

				BILLY
		I could have lost my fucking hands.

				HARRY
		That would have kept you out of the
		Magic Circle.
			(he studies the files)
		Which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		These are about Nix.

	Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

				HARRY
		You go through these.  Go on!

	Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
	PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
	painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
	There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is NIX.

				HARRY
		Wait a minute...

	He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
	colours.

				HARRY
		That's Butterfield...

				BILLY
			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		And who's that?

	ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

				HARRY
		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

	Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
	of another man's HEAD.

				BILLY
		Take a look at this.

				HARRY
			(looking at it)
		A Nix specialty?

	Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
	glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
	his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
	beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
	a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
	DARKNESS.

				BILLY
		I don't know any of these tricks...

	Harry studies the etchings.

				HARRY
			(a slow burn)
		Maybe they're not tricks.

				BILLY
			(mystified)
		I mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what Harry said)
		What do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

				HARRY
		What did Vinovich say? Something
		about walking a path between --

				BILLY
		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
		says that all the time.

				HARRY
		That's because he knew.  He'd seen
		these files and knew.

				BILLY
		Knew what?

	Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
	Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	Harry takes out his gun. 

	Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	The TRACK is completely silent. 

	Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
	backs away.

				BILLY
		Harry!

	Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck are you?

	Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

				HARRY
		Okay.  Hold it right there.

	The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

	But it's still terrorizing Billy.

				BILLY
			(in mortal terror)
		Get it off me!

	Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
	books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
	vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

				HARRY
		Hokey enough for you?

				BILLY
		I'm out of here, man!  Are you
		coming?

	Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

				HARRY
		I'm coming.

	Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	As he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

				HARRY
		Ah, shaddup!

	He FIRES at the projector a second time.

	On the GUN SHOT --

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

	Billy and Harry are parting.

				HARRY
		Thanks, Billy.

				BILLY
		Hey, anytime.
			(a beat)
		Actually, no.  This was enough. 

	They shake, and part.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

				VALENTIN
			(quietly)
		I can't let you in.

				HARRY
			(stepping in)
		Yeah, I know.

				VALENTIN
		You want more money, is that it?

	Harry pushes him aside.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts
	towards it.

				VALENTIN
		Leave her alone --

				HARRY
		Shut up!

	He pushes open the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
	Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

				DOROTHEA
		This is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
		meddling with his body...

	Harry approaches, slowly.

				DOROTHEA
		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
		used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		Why did you come back?

				HARRY
		I didn't leave.  I was just digging
		around.

	Dorothea looks up at him.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		What did you find?

				HARRY
		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		She threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh Christ.

				HARRY
			(a beat)
		Why don't you tell me the truth?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

	Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
	PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

				HARRY
		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
		Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

				DOROTHEA
		It was more than that, I think.

				HARRY
		He was the real thing, right?

				DOROTHEA
		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

				HARRY
		Stuff?

				DOROTHEA
		He could get into people's heads. 
		Make them see things. Terrible
		things.  And he could levitate. 
		Juggle fire.

				HARRY
		He taught all this to Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		Some or it.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin is listening at the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

				HARRY
		So Swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(Dorothea nods)
		And what?  You thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

				DOROTHEA
		I told you --

				HARRY
		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		Including yours.

				DOROTHEA
		No.

				HARRY
		You said you weren't with him for
		love.

				DOROTHEA
		I wasn't.

				HARRY
		 What then?

				DOROTHEA
		I was grateful to him.  I owed him
		my life.  And he loved me. He
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

				HARRY
		He thought Nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
	from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
	stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

				DOROTHEA
		Shit!

	They are very close to each other.

				HARRY
			(reassuring)
		It's okay.

				DOROTHEA
		No it isn't.  You can't help me.

				HARRY
			(tenderly)
		I'm here, aren't I?

	He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

				HARRY
		Nothing's going to happen to you.  

				DOROTHEA
			(seductive)
		Nothing?

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Nothing you don't want. 

	They kiss again, passionately.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
	the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
	to the phone and dials.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
	flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
	Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

	It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

	INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
	palms churn against the night sky...

	INTERCUT

	Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
	of Harry and Dorothea.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

				DOROTHEA
			(whispers)
		I was so afraid.

				HARRY
		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you sure?

				HARRY
		I'm sure.
			(kisses her)
		He's dead.

				DOROTHEA
		I know.  I'm the one who shot
		him.

	ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

				DOROTHEA
		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
		to get Swann to come to him.

				HARRY
			(realizing)
		And they all came...

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Quaid and Jennifer--

				DOROTHEA
		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
		ready for them.

	There's a NOISE downstairs.

				DOROTHEA
			(nervous)
		What was that?

				HARRY
		It's okay. 

	Harry slips out of bed.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  He has his gun.

				HARRY
		Valentin? 

	Dorothea appears behind him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?  Wait!

	Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

				HARRY
		What the hell-?

	Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
	ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
	skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
	skull.

				HARRY
			(in pain)
		Aah!

	Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
	Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

				DOROTHEA
		It's him!  It's Nix!

	Harry goes out into the passageway.

				HARRY
		Valentin!  Get some lights on!

	As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
	erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
	"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
	physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
	writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
	it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
	leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     

	The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
	Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
	he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
	Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the CASKET.

				HARRY
		Somebody you know?

	Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God!

	The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
	gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

				HARRY
		Which goes first?  My face or
		your heart?

	The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
	and dies.

				DOROTHEA
		Who in God's name are you?

	She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you all right?

				HARRY
		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
		in here!

	Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
	to force off the lid. 

	Valentin and Dorothea enter.

				VALENTIN
		What are you doing?  This is
		sacrilege.

	He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	Inside, Swann's corpse.

				VALENTIN
		Are you satisfied now?

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		It's all right.  It's not
		hurting...

	He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

				HARRY
		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		It looks like you're not a widow
		after all.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
	binds Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		You rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		You paid off the doctor.  You set
		up the fake body.  Yes?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		And then... because I was
		getting too close to something --
			(at Dorothea)
		--or someone, you called Swann

				VALENTIN
		I tried to pay you off.

				HARRY
		Was that Swann's idea?

				VALENTIN
		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
		any more bloodshed. That's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for Nix to come
		after.

				HARRY
		Nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

				VALENTIN
		Haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	Nix's resurrection is plausible.

				HARRY
		I want to see Swann face to face.

				VALENTIN
		Why don't you leave this alone? Let
		everybody think it's over?

				DOROTHEA
		What about me?

				VALENTIN
		Nix was never interested in you. 
		It was always Swann. 

	A beat.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
		let it alone. 

	A BELL starts to TOLL-

				HARRY
			(con't.)
		He went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	The TOLLING carries over into

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
	MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
	Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
	Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
	Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
	the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
	she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
	are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
	in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
	dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

	Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
	"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
	down into the street.

				1ST WORKER
		Watch out!

	On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
	We don't see who.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
	cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

	Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

	The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

	On Harry, as he gets into his.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

				VALENTIN
		Who's there?

	He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
	He swings round.  Too late.

	Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
	to the ground.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(conversationally)
		I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
		another profession, I would have
		been a surgeon.

	On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

	Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

				BUTTERFIELD
		To be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

				VALEMTIN
		No. . .

				BUTTERFIELD
		Let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

				VALENTIN
		Please.

				BUTTERFIELD
		I could scoop them out.

				VALENTIN
		Don't.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So tell me where Nix is buried.

				VALENTIN
		I don't know.

	Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

	CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	Butterfield's body.

				VALENTIN
		Wait!

	On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

				VALENTIN
		I'll tell you.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You'll do more.than that.

	EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

	A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

	Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
	inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.

	INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY		   

	It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
	are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
	Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

	Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
	the Stranger. 

	He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

	As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
	GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

	INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

	Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

	Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

				HARRY
		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

				HARRY
		You had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	Silence.

				HARRY
		A lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		They'll never find out. 

	Harry looks up.

	Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

				HARRY
		Look, Ma, no wires.

				SWANN
		You shouldn't have followed me,
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		How the fuck do you do that?

				SWANN
		Now I'm going to have to kill you.

				HARRY
		I don't think so.  You need me
		alive.

				SWANN
		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

	Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

				HARRY
		Be careful.  Funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	Swann stops, inches from the ground.

				HARRY
		You know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  You can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

				SWANN
		Illusionists get. Las Vegas
		contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
		burned.

				HARRY
		Or murdered, like Nix.

				SWANN
		He deserved it.

				HARRY
		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		Maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  That's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

				SWANN
		I did it for Dorothea.

				HARRY
		Oh yeah?

				SWANN
		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
	they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

				HARRY
		So Nix won't come looking for her?

				SWANN
		It's me betrayed him.

				HARRY
		And she shot him I  I think that'd
		piss me off if I were Nix.

				SWANN
			(despairing)
		I don't know what else to do.

				HARRY
		Help me.

	On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

				HARRY
		Listen.  If he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		And he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		And if he's just another phony
		Messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
	are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
	SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

	We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
	see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
	Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
	grins.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
	the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
	the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
	brandy.

				SWANN
		Is this the best brandy you've
		got?

				CASHIER
		If that's what's on the shelves.

	Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

				SWANN
		Can you change a thousand for me?

				CASHIER
			(amazed)
		You're shittin' me.

				HARRY
		Can we go?

	Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

				HARRY
		Oh Jeez.

				SWANN
		Will that do?  No?

	Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
	QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

				SWANN
		That better? 

	The Cashier gapes.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

	The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
	struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

				SHOCK CUT TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

	CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
	crazed. 

	Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
	shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
	runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

	NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
	falling gouts of dark fluid --

	-- she struggles, SOBBING --
			 CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She tosses around on the bed

				BACK TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
	from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
	SPLASHES on her upturned face --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets
	up and goes out onto --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

	Looks down the stairs.

				DOROTHEA
		Who's there?

	Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry.

	BLOOD runs from his cut face.

				DOROTHEA
		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
		to your face?

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		It was me.

	She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
	against the wail.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Guess who we're going to see?

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

	Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
	stares at Harry.

				SWANN
		You think I'm an asshole.

				HARRY
		Didn't know you read minds.

				SWANN
			(a warning)
		I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
		But you know that.
			(an apology)
		So I like playing games with
		people.  Gives them something to
		wonder about...

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		I distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. It's like a
		public service.  It doesn't mean
		much in the end. They're all going
		to die.

				HARRY
		And you're not? 

	Silence for a moment.

				SWANN
		Oh, I was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  That's why
		I liked Nix.  He promised me all
		these explanations.

				HARRY
		And he didn't have them?

				SWANN
		He had something.  He showed me how
		to bend the rules.  A little
		levitation.  A few fireworks.

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		No.
			(a beat)
		At the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. He
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
		Shit...

				HARRY
		And you believed him?

				SWANN
		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		See, that's his best trick.  No
		illusions.  Just the truth.
			(he looks at Harry)
		Are you ready for that? 

	Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

				SWANN
		Hey!

	Harry drinks.

				SWANN
		Thought not.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

	PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
	door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

				SWANN
		She's not here.

	Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

				HARRY
		Did she know where Nix was buried?

				SWANN
		No.

				HARRY
		Who else did?  Did Valentin?

				SWANN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Jesus!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT	 

	Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
	stars.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       

	Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
	Dorothea is handcuffed. 

	He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Like the look of these?  I made
		them myself, to set him free.

				DOROTHEA
		Why did you wait so long?

				BUTTERFIELD
		I didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  I had to teach
		myself.  And that took time.

				DOROTHEA
		And you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

				BUTTERFIELD
		If he was just a man like me, then
		no.  But he's not.

				DOROTHEA
		What is he?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Maybe he'll show you.

	ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

	There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

	It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
	We DRIFT towards the front door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

	Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
	CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
	blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
	indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
	eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
	ears and scalps.

	And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

				NORMAN
		He will come!  He will come! He
		will come!

	EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

	The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Anything?

				VALENTIN (V.0.)
		Not yet.

	Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

				BUTTERFIELD
		If you've lied to me to me --

				VALENTIN
		I swear... this is the place Swann
		told me about.  The rocks...

	On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	Valentin.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
		you'd better not --

	A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

				BUTTERFIELD
		What the fuck are you playing at?

	He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
	Opens a WOUND across his arm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
	Twice.  Then --

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Butterfield!

	Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

				VALENTIN
			(blinded)
		In the corner...

	The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Valentin)
		Keep away from it.

	Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
	He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

	Closer... 

	Closer... 

	He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
	ROAR!

	He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

				VALENTIN
		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(reverentially)
		It's him... it's him.

	On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	The car is static; the engine still running.

				HARRY
		They got here before us.

				SWANN
		Looks that way.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

	HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

	Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
	in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
	Harry slides into the grave.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
	and scramble out.

				HARRY
		Swann?  Swann!

	Silence.

	Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
	round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

				VALENTIN
		D'Amour --

				HARRY
		Shit...

				VALENTIN
		Help me.

	He collapses into Harry's arms.

				HARRY
		Swann!

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
	to help?

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Swann!

	He decides.  Gets out.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

	Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

				HARRY
		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

	Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

				VALENTIM
		He's got Dorothea. 

				SWANN
		And Nix?

				VALENTIN
		Him too.

				HARRY
		We've got to get you to a hospital.

				VALENTIN
		Don't bother.

				HARRY
		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
		already.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry, D'Amour...

				HARRY
		What about?

				VALENTIN
		... Looks like you're going...
		to lose... one more.

	Valentin dies.

				HARRY
			(despairing)
		... no...

				SWANN
		He's better off this way.

				HARRY
			(furious)
		Nobody's better off this wav!

				SWANN
		You don't get it, do you? We're
		shit. D'Amour.

	He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
	Nix's grave.

				SWANN
		That's where we're all going.

				HARRY
		In my time, and nobody else's.

	ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
	getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
	retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is silent now.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

	ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
	WHITE now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Do you wish him to be amongst us?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Will you come to him on your
		knees?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Be ready.

	Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
	With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
	MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of GLASS. 

	ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
	BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
	Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
	head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

	ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
	into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

				DOROTHEA
		Listen.  You've got everything you
		want.  You don't need me. .. 

	A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
	POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

				BUTTERFIELD
		No, but he will.  After what you
		did to him.

	He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
		that.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
	breathless with anticipation.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

	On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

	And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

	On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The whisper runs through the congregation:

				CULTISTS
		He's coming home... he/s coming
		home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

				DOROTHEA
		Christ in Heaven.

	ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
	THROB. 

	Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				CULTISTS
		He's with us... He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
	TRACK. 

	Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

	Butterfield looks up. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Hold her!

	On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
	comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
	his eyes.

	NIX'S P.O.V.

	The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

				NIX
			(fury to agony)
		Aaarrrgh!

	He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
	literally ROARS in rage.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
	repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
	shards of glass now, crazed.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
	getting out.  Swann stays put. 

	The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

				HARRY
			(spooked)
		Jesus... what the hell's going on
		in there?

				SWANN
		At a guess... they just resurrected
		him.

				HARRY
		Fuck.

	Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
	of the car and follows.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
	for the count. 

	On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
	disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

	The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

				NIX
		Children...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

				NIX
		Will you suffer to come unto me?

	One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
	agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

	Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

				NIX
		I've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  Will you hear it?

				CULTISTS
		Yes... yes...

				NIX
		Follow me then.

	He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

				NIX
		Do I know you, child?

	He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

				NIX
		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		Where's Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where he is.

	Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


				NIX
		He'll come.  We've got unfinished
		business, he and I.

	Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
	Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	The Cultists follow.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Nix strides into the middle of the room.

				NIX
			(whispered to Dorothea)
		Something terrible's going to
		happen.  But if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		Are you ready for my wisdom?

				CULTISTS
		Tell us... tell us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
	He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
	terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
	the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

				SWANN
			(in terrified awe)
		This is where we killed him.

				HARRY
			(looking at table)
		You didn't try hard enough.

				SWANN
		I can't... I can't go any
		further...

	Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
	grip.  He crosses to the door. 

	Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
	Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

				NIX
		Here is my wisdom.

	He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
	directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
	power.

				BARBARA
		Show us. Puritan.

				NORMAN
		Yes, show us!

				ALL
		Show us!  Show us!

	With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
	Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
	perhaps bottomless. 

	Dorothea SCREAMS!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
	passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
	hold of his arm.

				SWANN
			(to Harry)
		Whatever he's doing to her, stop
		him!

	And Harry's up and away --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	-- he dashes over the glass --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

				NIX
			(to unseen Cultists)
		You see, I escaped the grave. So I
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

				NORMAN
		What's happening?

				NIX
		I have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
	They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

				BARBARA
			(sobbing)
		Why?  Why?

				NIX
		You're not worthy.  None of you. 
		Only Swann was worthy. You just
		waited like lambs.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.

				NIX
		Well I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
	ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
	and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
	gaze.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
	resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
	is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

				SWANN
		Aah!

				BUTTERFIELD
		Go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at Swann
		again)
		Go on!  Go on!

	Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
	wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
	the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(screaming)
		No!

	He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
	running from his wound.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	Nix swings round.

				NIX
		You're not Swann.  Who are you?
			(a beat) )
		Oh... I know what you want. He lets
		Dorothea slip from his arms.  

	Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
	Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

				HARRY
		Hang on!

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contact

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Nix!

	Nix looks up.

				NIX
		There you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

				NIX
		I've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

				SWANN
		And?

				NIX
		I should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  I wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  I was born to murder
		the world.

	ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
	back into the room.

				NIX
		You could still help me do that.

				SWANN
		Why would I want to?

				NIX
		Because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

				SWANN
		Not true.

				NIX
		The woman has a new love in her
		life.  Your friends are dead.
		Nobody's left to save you, but me

	He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		I've got to help him.

				DOROTHEA
		You can't.

				HARRY
		Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		Everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Bastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

				NIX
		Will you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Nix lets him go.

				NIX
		You know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.

				SWANN
		Yes.

				NIX
		But until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

				NIX
		Wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

				SWANN
		No!

				NIX
		Liar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

				NIX
		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
	one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
	Dorothea.

				NIX
		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
		I'll show you!

	He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

				SWANN
		Harry!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Harry!  Stop him!

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

				NIX (V.O.)
		Where is she? 

	Harry turns.

	Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
	body as he comes at Harry!

				NIX
		Where did she go?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.

				NIX
		You've got Swann's disease. You
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		Wrong!

	His fingers slide all the way in!

				HARRY
		Oh God!

	Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
	are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

				NIX
		Tell me where she is... and I'll
		make it go away...

	Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
	SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

	ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

				HARRY
		Oh God... oh God...

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
	face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

	ON HARRY

	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	Reaching out for the image.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The Woman reaches for Harry.

				WOMAN           
		Help me.

	ON HARRY

	as he touches the wall.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!

	He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!  Dorothea!

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
	screaming when she disappears.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	ON HARRY 

	literally beating his head against the wall!

				HARRY
		No!  No!  No!

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry...

	Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

				DOROTHEA
		It's not real, Harry-

	Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

	ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
	fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


				HARRY
		... oh... God...

				DOROTHEA
		I'm here, Harry.

				HARRY
		...yes?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

	Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

				NIX
			(to Dorothea)
		There you are, child. 

	Harry starts to look round.

				DOROTHEA
		Don't look.

				HARRY
		I... have... to.

				NIX
		Come on, child.  I want Swann to
		see you die. 

	Harry turns and looks at Nix.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
	of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

				NIX
			(to Harry)
		What are you looking at?

	ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
	and now slips inside. 

	ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

	ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
	hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

				HARRY
			(points to his brow)
		There... there!

	ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

	ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

	The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
	BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
	used to be.

	ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
	wall, shaking.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		I'm okay.  I'm okay.

	Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
	actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
	kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
	up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
	forehead --

				NIX
		One... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God.

	Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

	Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
	stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

				SWANN (V.O.)
		... D'Amour...

	Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
	Swann is on the threshold. 

	Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the Meditation Room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
	backed towards it by Nix. 

	When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
	DEMONIACAL.

				NIX
		I am the purest of the pure.  I am
		the darkest of the dark...

	Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

				SWANN
		Harry.  You can't kill him. 

	Harry crouches beside Swann.

				HARRY
			(whispers)
		He did something with the ground.

				SWANN
		Yes?

				HARRY
		Can you do it?

				SWANN
		I don't know.

				HARRY
		Try.

	ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

				NIX (V.O.)
		I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
		Hell.

	Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	Nix topples.

	ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

	A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Get out of here!

	The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
	Harry, of course. 

	Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

				NIX
		No!  No!  No!

	He's at the edge of the pit.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
	reaches for Harry, as -- 

	-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

	Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
	They look back to see 

	NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

	At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
	closes his eyes.

				CUT TO:

	INT. THE PIT

	What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
	death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

	Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
	against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
	smithereens.  And as he falls --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Is it finished?

				HARRY
		I think so.

	No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth. 

	And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
	approaching MAGMA.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Come on...

	She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
	relief.

	INT. THE PIT

	Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
	disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
	spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				HARRY
		What the fuck? 

				DOROTHEA
		Harry-?

				HARRY
		Out!  Out! 

	They race for the front door --

	INT. THE PIT

	-- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at
	a breath-taking rate

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off
	the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the
	resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the
	house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down. 

	ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN

	The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN

	The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE
	reigns.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at
	the house.  Nothing.

				HARRY
			(quietly)
		It's finished.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN

	ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

	WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - DESERT ROAD - DAWN			   

	Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as

	THE CREDITS ROLL
TITLE SEQUENCE


	As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY


	A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.

	EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

	Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.

	END CREDITS.

				CUT WIDE TO;

	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

	A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

	We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

	BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

	The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

	The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

	A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

				NIX
		And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...

				CULTISTS
			(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

	Butterfield enters. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	Nix looks up.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Swann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
	SOBBING.

				NIX
		Hush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

				NIX
		I said hush.

				GIRL
		Please.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

				NIX
			(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

				NIX
			(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.

				GIRL
		Keep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

				GIRL
		Please... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?

				NIX
		You don't like him, do you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		He wants your magic.

				NIX
		Maybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

				GIRL
		What are you going to do?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

	The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

				SWANN
			(to all three)
		Are we ready?

				JENNIFER
			(cool)
		Say the word.

				PIMM
			(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

				SWANN
		No.  He's gone too far.

				PIMM
		So he took a child.

				JENNIFER
		He'll kill her.

				PIMM
		No he won't.

				SWANN
			(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

				QUAID
		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

				SWANN
		So stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

	Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

				SWANN
			(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

	Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

				1ST MAN
		Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

				QUAID
		I changed my mind.

				1ST WOMAN
		Come and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

				SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
			(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

	INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

	Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

				JENNIFER
		Don't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

				BARBARA
		I'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.

				PIMM
		He's going to kill us all...

				JENNIFER
		Where did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

				QUAID

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

				SWANN
		You're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.

				NIX
		I knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.

				NIX
		I've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do
		is...beg.

				SWANN
		Fuck you.

				NIX
		You don't think I've got it to
		give?

				SWANN
		No!

	Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

				NIX
		You're wrong.

	He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

				NIX
		I could eat your fucking soul,
		Swann.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
	from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
	hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

				JENNIFER
		Fuck!

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

				NIX
		You want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

				NIX
		Want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Aah!

				QUAID
		Get away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
	open, and enters.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

				QUAID
		Swann?

				NIX
			(to Quaid)
		Here he is.

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

				NIX
		Take a look, Swann!  These are your
		friends.

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.

				JENNIFER (V.O.)
		What have you done to him? 

SWANN'S P.O.V.

	of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

				SWANN
		Don't touch me.  He's got... got
		into my head.

				NIX
		You want to be like that, Swann? 
		Mud and shit?

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

	SWANN'S P.O.V. 

	of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

				NIX
		Come here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.

				NIX
			(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

				NIX
			(a roar)
		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.

				SWANN
		Jesus-

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

	Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

				1ST CULTIST
			(with distressing
		confidence)
		You can't kill him.

				2ND CULTIST
		He'll just rise up again!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

				NIX
		Help me!

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

				JENNIFER
		Quickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.

				NIX
			(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?

				SWANN
		Binding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.

				NIX
		Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

				NIX
		Sw

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

				GIRL
			(quietly)
		Is it finished?

				SWANN
		It's finished.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
	their confidence and courage gone. 

	Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
	body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

				PIMM
		Dead?

				QUAID
		Dead.

				PIMM
		What now?

				SWANN
		We bury him so deep no one will
		ever find him.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

	The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
	dashes towards camera, then halts. 

	HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
	into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

	ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

	The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
	gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
	some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
	congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

	ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

	The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
	a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
	it has a certain charm.

	INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

	A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
	host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
	At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
	but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
	name.

				BLONDE GIRL
		How'd you spell that again?

				HARRY
		D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry
		D'Amour.

				BLONDE GIRL
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
		Isn't that French for something?

	ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Yeah.  It's French.

				BLONDE GIRL
		For love, right?

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
			(grinning)
		That's so cool.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

	Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
	shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's
	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

				HARRY
		Yeah?

				BELLBOY
		You haven't paid the cab.  He won't
		give us your bags 'til you pay him.

				HARRY
		How much?

				BELLBOY
		Thirty-five bucks.

				HARRY
		Tell him he can keep them. The
		Bellboy looks puzzled.

				HARRY
		Just kidding.

	Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
	bills.

				HARRY
		I've got my life in there.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
	open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
	of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
	CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
	destruction. 

	ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
	shower.  Starts to undress.

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

	Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
	sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

				HARRY
		Hello, L.A.

				BELLBOY
		Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

				HARRY
		You bet.

	EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
	classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
	ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

	ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
	recorder.

				HARRY
		Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
		got a great sense of humour or he's
		paying her to laugh.
			(looks at hamburger in
		disgust)
		Jesus.

	On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

				HARRY
			(into tape recorder)
		He's finished.

	Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
	tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
	up and gets in.

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	He turns the key in the ignition.

				CUT  TO:

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

	In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It
	reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

	ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
	door beside the store window. 

	WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
	side of the street. 

	Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

				HARRY
		Superstitious?

	He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

				TAPERT (V.O.)
		Oh my God!

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.

				MILLER
		Fuckhead.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

				HARRY
		What the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

				HARRY
			(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		What are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

				QUAID
		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?

				QUAID
		Yes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		And are you afraid?

				QUAID
		Yes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

				QUAID
			(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


				HARRY
		You need an ambulance.

				QUAID
			(in pain)
		Too late.  Why are you here? Did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		NO ... I...

	Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

				QUAID
			(quietly)
		My God.

				HARRY
		What?

				QUAID
		You've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

				HARRY
		Yeah.  You could say that.

				QUAID
		You're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  And it's drawn to you.
			(looks at Harry)
		You don't like that.

				HARRY
		Not much.

				QUAID
		You can't change it.  You have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between Heaven and
		Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
		it.

	Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
	pain.

				HARRY
		Hold on.

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

				HARRY
		The Puritan?

				QUAID
		Yes...

				HARRY
		Who is he? 

	Quaid shudders, and dies.

				HARRY
			(softly; sadly)
		Shit.

	He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
	but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

	The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
	through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
	OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

				EDDISON
			(to Harry)
		What were you doing up there?

				HARRY
		I'm a private detective.  I was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  A guy called Tapert.
		Insurance fraud.

				EDDISON
			(writing)
		Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
		Butterfield.

				HARRY
		Tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  He came here to get his palm
		read.

				EDDISON
		What makes you so sure?

				HARRY
			(shrugs)
		I got a file on him two inches
		thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
		This is something else.  Ever heard
		of someone called the Puritan?

				EDDISON
		New one on me.
			(to Officer)
		Okay.  Let's see him.

	OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
	GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

				EDDISON
		Where the fuck is he?

				HARRY
		He got up and walked.

				EDDISON
			(looking up at window)
		After that fall?. He must have
		broken half his bones.

	WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

				HARRY
		I don't think he'd have given a
		shit.

				CUT TO:

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the
	floors.  Very little furniture. 

	Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
	out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

				BUTTERFIELD
		D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
		that name?

				MILLER
		I know him.  I saw him.

	He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
	sighing with pleasure.

				MILLER
		I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got
		possessed and he saved the little
		bastard's life.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's a priest?

				MILLER
		No.  He's just a guy who's got a
		nose for this shit.
			(a beat.  A smirk)
		Like you.

	A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for
	glass.

				BUTTERFIELD 
		I don't want him getting in the
		way.

				MILLER
		He won't. 

	Another silence.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(dreamily)
		We've all of us waited too long to
		have the homecoming spoiled.

				MILLER
		What do you mean, "all of us?"

				BUTTERFIELD
		You didn't think it was just going
		to be you and me?  A lot of people
		believed in Nix. They haven't
		forgotten his promise.

				MILLER
		About?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Death.

				MILLER
		What about death?

				BUTTERFIELD

		It's an illusion.

	beneath, and on to the name "Harry D'Amour." 

	ON SWANN, pensive as he studies the paper.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
			(softly)
		Hey... 

	He looks up, startled.

	DOROTHEA The sun's shining out there. Dorothea is dressed in
	a white robe now.  She literally brings light into this
	gloomy room.  On the shelves behind Swann are a number of art
	brut figurines, vaguely recalling the idols outside Nix's
	"temple."

				DOROTHEA
		Bad show last night?

				SWANN
			(wearily)
		The usual.  Full house. Standing
		ovation.  I tell them it's magic...

				DOROTHEA
			(distastefully)
		... they believe you.

				SWANN
		Yeah.
			(a beat)
		Remember Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Sure.

				SWANN
		Somebody killed him.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God.

				SWANN
			(disturbed)
		I just saw him.

	A difficult silence.  Then Swann crosses to the door.

				SWANN
		I'm putting in a new illusion
		tonight.  Will you be there?

				DOROTHEA
		Sure.  You want me to find out
		about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?

				SWANN
		No.
			(superstitiously)
		I'm not going near him.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

	VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's
	collection:  a huge, framed POSTER from a late nineteenth
	century magic spectacular.  Valentin is fifty or so, his gray
	hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in
	a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious. 
	Elegant. 

	He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

				VALENTIN
		Higher.  Another inch.  The left
		hand side's too low.

	Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

				DOROTHEA
		Valentin?

				VALENTIN
			(to Hangers)
		Good.  There.
			(to Dorothea)
		Yes?

				DOROTHEA
			(gives him the newspaper)
		You saw this?

	Valentin nods.  They walk back through the house together,
	while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

				DOROTHEA
		I want you to find this man D'Amour
		for me.

	She passes the newspaper to Valentin.  He looks down at it.
	ON NEWSPAPER.  

	C.U. of Harry's blurred PICTURE.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  A shaft of
	sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches. 

	Somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

				HARRY
			(waking)
		What...?

	He rolls over.  The sun strikes his eyes.  He winces.

				HARRY
		Shit.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Go away.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		It's one in the afternoon.

				HARRY
		What are you, my mother?

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I need to speak to you, Mr.
		D'Amour.  About last night.

	Harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  He opens it a
	little.  The face of VALENTIN is visible through the crack.

				HARRY
		Whatever I said, I didn't mean it,
		okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

				VALENTIN
		We've never met.

				HARRY
		Then what do you want?

				VALENTIN
		I'm here to offer you a job.

				HARRY
		I'm going back to New York in--
			(consults his watch)
		Shit!  I'm outta here.

				VALENTIN
		Have you got a job that'll pay you
		five thousand a day?

	A beat.  Then Harry takes the chain off the door.

				HARRY
		Do I get lunch?

	Harry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee.

				HARRY
		Whose is the car?

				VALENTIN
		Mine.

				HARRY
		Nah.  You're driving it too
		carefully.

				VALENTIN
			(sparring)
		Maybe I just bought it.

				HARRY
		Somebody's been smoking in here for
		months.

	He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.

				HARRY
		Havanas.  You're not the
		smoker.  So who is?

				VALENTIN
			(laughs)
		You could almost pass for a
		detective, D'Amour.
			(a beat)
		I work for the best illusionist in
		the world.

				HARRY
		Philip Swann?

				VALENTIN
		You know of him?

				HARRY
		I saw him in Vegas once.

				VALENTIN
		Are you a gambling man?

				HARRY
		When I can afford to lose. Swann's
		quite a magician.

				VALENTIN
		Never call him that.  He's strictly
		an illusionist.

				HARRY
		What's the difference?

				VALENTIN
		Illusions are trickery. Magicians
		do it for real.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - GATES - DAY

	The sedan turns into a driveway.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
	marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large
	mausoleum.

				HARRY
		Any movie stars buried here?

				VALENTIN
		Probably.

				HARRY
		It's not a bad place.  Warm.
		Great view.

				VALENTIN
		I don't think the dead much care.

				HARRY
		Are you sure?

				VALENTIN
		Are you a believer, then?

	Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

				HARRY
		I've signed on for them all in my
		time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't
		have too many saviours.

	Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
	in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She
	wears a wide-brimmed hat.

				HARRY
		Who is she?

				VALENTIN
		Swann's wife.

				CUT TO:

	VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He
	glances up. 

	Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
	conversation.

				DOROTHEA
		I want you to help me help my
		husband.  I know he's in some kind
		of trouble.  And it's something to
		do with the man you saw murdered.

				HARRY
		Did your husband know Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.  They weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  I
		think Philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

				HARRY
		You don't?

				DOROTHEA
		I think we make our own futures.

	Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

				HARRY
		What's the connection?

				DOROTHEA
			(covering now, but well)
		I don't exactly know. 
		Philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

				HARRY
		Why not?

	Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

				DOROTHEA
		He's a secretive man.

				HARRY
		And you don't ask questions?

				DOROTHEA
		We don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

				HARRY
		Does that mean...?

				DOROTHEA
		We haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

				HARRY
		But obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

				DOROTHEA
		We wouldn't be having this
		conversation if I didn't. Swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	Harry, frowns.

				DOROTHEA
		You don't believe me.

				HARRY
		He's an illusionist.  It's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	Dorothea stares at him. 

				HARRY
		Sorry.  You asked.

				DOROTHEA
		No.  You're right.  He could have
		been something more. Maybe a lot
		more.  But people get lost.  Even
		good people. Too much fame.  Too
		much money,

				HARRY
		Where do I sign? 

	Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

				DOROTHEA
		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Harry.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.

				HARRY
		I'm no bodyguard.

				DOROTHEA
		That's not what I'm asking for. I
		want somebody who can find out what
		Philip saw in those damn cards. 
		And stop it from happening.

				HARRY
		When do you want me to start?

				DOROTHEA
		Come to the show with me. Tonight I
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  They love him.

				HARRY
		Do you?

	The question catches Dorothea off guard.

				DOROTHEA
		I didn't marry him for love, Mr.
		D'Amour.  Tonight?

				HARRY
		Sure.

	Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches
	her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her
	departing figure.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

	CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
	theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
	below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
	PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS
	are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
	MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
	file in. 

	The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
	He makes his way inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
	conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-
	talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
	controlled hysteria. 

	Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit
	CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,
	already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

				DOROTHEA
		I'm glad you could make it. 

	Harry takes a seat beside her.

				HARRY
		Hey, this is a big deal for me. You
		know what seats like this cost in
		New York?

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for
	the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like
	flies.

				SWANN
		Valentin!

	Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is
	waiting there.

				SWANN
			(irritated)
		Valentin!

				VALENTIN
		I'm here.

				SWANN
		The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who
		I think it is? 

	Valentin nods.

	ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

				SWANN
		He's young.

	MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin
	hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
			(to Swann)
		Ready?

				SWANN
		Ready.

	Swann rises up into the flies.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
		How the fuck does he do that?

				2ND TECHNICIAN
		It's wires, man.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
		I never seen no wires.

				2ND TECHNICIAN
			(sarcastic)
		So what is it?  Magic?

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

	The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,
	whose gaze is intent. 

	The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
	apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
	blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
		standing on the threshold of a
		miracle...

	A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	The vortex BLAZES -- 

	And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

	Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
	dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
	Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

	A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
	The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
	crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
	sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

				SWANN
		My friends ... come with me...into
		the Great Beyond.

	A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

	The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. 

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
		He's good.

				DOROTHEA
		You haven't seen anything yet.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT

	The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them. 

	Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
	SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to
	the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

	A new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing
	danger. 

	The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously. 

	ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

				DOROTHEA
			(a whisper)
		This is the new illusion.

	ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
	DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
	somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
	It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
	glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
	struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
	the wheel spins faster and faster. 

	Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
	outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
	to his head. 

	ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

	BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
	shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
	wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

	The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
	the swords DROPS. 

	The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

	As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
	carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
	him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
	stop. 

	More GASPS from the audience. 

	ON HARRY, having a -- 

	FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
	The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

				HARRY 
		There's something wrong... 

	ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
	third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
	until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

	ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

	The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
	nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
	dies away in a matter of moments.

	ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

				DOROTHEA
		No. . .

	ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
	wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
	reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

	There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
	sobs of horror.

				1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
		What happened?

				2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
		It's a trick.

				3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
		Somebody help him.

	The curtains start to close.

	ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

				DOROTHEA
			(to Harry)
		I've got to get to him!

	The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
	seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
	One or two are even praying. 

	Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
	against the flood of the exiting crowd.

				HARRY
		Out of the way!  Out of the way!

	He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
	she can duck beneath it.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
	MANAGER at his side.

				VALENTIN
			(to Stage Manager)
		Get then out of here, for God's
		sake --

				STAGE MANAGER
		You heard him!  It's not a fucking
		show!

	He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
	arm.

				STAGE MANAGER
		Who are you?

	Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
	MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
	towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
	enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

				MILLER
		Psst!

	Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

	Butterfield enters.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

				DOROTHEA
			(softly)
		Swann... 

	A DOCTOR appears.

				DOCTOR 
		I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

	The Doctor checks Swann's body.

				DOCTOR
			(to Dorothea)
		I'm sorry...

	Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
	He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

	WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

	It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
	used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
	beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
	and echoing. 

	The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
	FIGURE ducking away.

				HARRY
		Hey!

	He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
	listens for movement. 

	Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

	Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
	nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

				MILLER
		Got you, fucker!

	Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
		Swann? 

	Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

				HARRY
		You did.
			(a beat)
		Didn't you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Why would I do that?

				HARRY
		Beats me.

	Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

				HARRY
		Deep shit? 

	Butterfield hits him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
		I told you --

	Butterfield hits him again.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
			(raises his hand)
		All right.  It was...

	Butterfield comes a little closer.

				HARRY
			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
	Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

	He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
	of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
	TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
	OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
	MECHANISM. 

	Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

	-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
	closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
	The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

	Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
	BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

				HARRY
		Deep shit...

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. 
	Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

				EDDISON
		And this Butterfield guy--

				HARRY
		--vanished.

				EDDISON
			(frustrated sigh)
		Another fucking magician. Jesus.

	Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
	being taken into another office.

				HARRY
		Are you finished with me?

				EDDISON
		For now.  Are you planning to go
		back to New York?

				HARRY
			(watching Dorothea)
		No.  Not yet...

	INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

	Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

				HARRY
		Are they treating you okay?

				DOROTHEA
			(nods)
		I heard what happened.  It looks
		like somebody murdered him.

				HARRY
		I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
		But if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where you'd start.

				HARRY
		Well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

				DOROTHEA
		They won't tell you anything.

				HARRY
		I can be very persuasive.

				DOROTHEA
			(a beat)
		Yes.  I think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		We'd need to talk about your fee.

				HARRY
		Forget the fee.  If I find
		Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  If I don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  Either way... I
		get to spend some time... here.

	The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
	means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

	Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a
	bandage on his cut face, enters.

	INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

	A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
	all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
	WILDER. 

	Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

				HARRY
		Where'd you learn that?

				WILDER
		What?

				HARRY
			(points)
		That.

				WILDER
		At birth.  I don't know you --

				HARRY
		Harry D'Amour.

				WILDER
		I know all the kids coming up. Got
		to stay ahead of the game. But I
		don't know you.

				HARRY
		I'm in from New York.  I came to
		see Swann.

				WILDER
		What a tragedy.  It was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

				HARRY
		Was he taking a lot of risks?

				WILDER
		You don't know the half of it. I'm
		Walter Wilder, by the way.

				HARRY
		Not the Walter Wilder? 

	Walter beams.

				WILDER
		The one and only. 

	He hands Harry a card.

				WILDER
		Want to try?

	Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

				WILDER
		You know Vinovich?

				HARRY
			(not a clue)
		Sure.  Vivovich.

				WILDER
		He knew Swann way back.  He says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

				HARRY
		I'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

				WILDER
		People are pretty cagey.  Who do
		you know?

				HARRY
		For what?

				WILDER
		For an introduction.

				HARRY
		Well... nobody.

	Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

				WILDER
			(magnanimously)
		You do now.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

	The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

	Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is
	knotting a newly-bought tie.

				HARRY
		I only wear ties for funerals.

				WILDER
		You don't get in without one. It's
		like a gentlemen's club for
		illusionists.  Except most of us
		aren't gentlemen.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

	The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
	illusionists' posters. 

	Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
	where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
	audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
	half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
	stairs and towards the bar.

HARRY
		Are they all in the business?

				WILDER
		It's not a business. Harry. It's a
		vocation. 

	Wilder points to a locked door.

				WILDER
		That's what they call the
		Repository.  Every magic secret
		known to man's locked up in that
		room.

				HARRY
		Have you been in?

				WILDER
		No.  There's only three keys.
		Vinovich has got one, of
		course.
			(beat)
		He's a little crazy, by the way. 
		And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
		he's a real charmer.

				CUT TO

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

	Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
	and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
	two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

	In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

				VINOVICH
		It's more than entertainment. We're
		opening people's heads up.  Putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

				BILLY
		But they're fake miracles.

				VINOVICH
		Houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

				HARRY
		You believe that?

				VINOVICH
		I think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

				HARRY
		Heaven and Hell?

	Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

				VINOVICH
		Trickery and divinity.

				HARRY
		Are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

				VINOVICH
		No.  I'm saying they were always
		fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

				HARRY
		So could you walk on water?

				VINOVICH
			(deadly serious)
		I could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

				HARRY
		What about Swann's miracles?

	The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
	smile.

				VINOVICH
		They weren't worth a damn.

				HARRY
			(goading)
		I heard he was the best.

				VINOVICH
		If he was so good why's he so dead?

	Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

				HARRY
		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

				VINOVICH
		Oh, I've got plenty.

				HARRY
		I'd like to hear them. 

	Vinovich rises.

				VINOVICH
		I'm not saying another word.
			(to Wilder)
		You damn fool.  He's a
		journalist.

				HARRY
		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
		you too scared?

				VINOVICH
		He was a freak.  Everything he did
		was tainted.

	Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

				HARRY
		With what?

				VINOVICH
		Evil.  He was evil.
			(to Laura)
		Come on.

	She rises.

				VINOVICH
			(to the rest)
		Say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

				HARRY
		Great accent, by the way.  Is it
		Brooklyn?

				VINOVICH
			(pure Brooklyn)
		Fuck you.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Harry heads to the car.

				BILLY (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
	that he's not being watched.

				BILLY
		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
		sees me talking to you.  He's an
		asshole, but he's a powerful
		asshole.

				HARRY
		They go together.

				BILLY
			(lowered voice)
		I've heard a name.  Someone they
		talk about in whispers.

				HARRY
		Who?

				BILLY
		Nix.

				HARRY
		Nix?

				BILLY
		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

				HARRY
		Who is he?

				BILLY
		I think maybe he taught Swann.
			(hands Harry a card)
		This is me.  See ya around. 

	Billy hurries away.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		... I want somebody who can find
		out what Philip saw in those damn
		cards... 

	Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

				DISSOLVE TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				BUTTERFIELD
		Ever watched a man die?

	The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

				QUAID
		Please... I wasn't there... Ask
		Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared...

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is still asleep.

				CUT TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

	A long silence. 

	SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He picks up the receiver.

				HARRY
		This is D'Amour.
 
           
			CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
	source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry... I know it's late.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

	There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

				HARRY
		That's okay.

	As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
	page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		How did it go today?

				HARRY
		I went up to the Magic Castle. You
		were right.  He didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.

				CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		They were jealous of him.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Why?  Because he had you?

				BACK TO:

	INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

				DOROTHEA
		He... didn't have me..  I told you-

				HARRY
		You didn't marry him for love.

	DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

	She's a little uncomfortable now.

				HARRY
		So why did you marry him?

				DOROTHEA
		That's my business. Harry.

				HARRY
		Just curious.
			(a beat)
		Back to business.  Ever heard of a
		man called Nix?
			(silence)
		Dorothea?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
		know the name.

				HARRY
		What about Jennifer Desiderio?

				DOROTHEA
		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
		go.

				HARRY
		Okay.  I'll keep digging.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		Yes.  You do that.

	She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
	She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
	up the phone again.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
	Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

	CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

	EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
	heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
	Quaid's Waiting Room. 
	It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
	prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
	locks.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  

	Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
	enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
	TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
	Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		If you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
	false bottom.

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Yes...

	In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	He flicks to "D."

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		Desiderio...

	There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
	the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- Valentin!

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		What the fuck are you doing here?

				VALENTIN
		Looking for you.  I tried the
		hotel.

				HARRY
		Why'd you come here?

				VALENTIN
		You're a detective, with no clues. 
		Where else are you going to look? 
		I'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		Here's thirty thousand dollars.

				HARRY
		What for?

				VALENTIN
		A ticket home,

				HARRY
		You didn't hire me.  She did.
		If she wants me off the job, I
		want to hear it from her.

				VALENTIN
		She doesn't want to see you. She's
		had enough pain.  Enough churning
		over the past.  She wants it all
		left alone.

				HARRY
		Left alone?  Somebody's been
		murdered.

				VALENTIN
		Yes.  It's regrettable

				HARRY
		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
		why.

				VALENTIN
		What for?  You need to stay busy?

				HARRY
			(a confession)
		I like to know why things happen.

				VALENTIN
		Why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

				VALENTIN
		Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
		Just leave her alone.  Let her
		heal.

	He glances back at Valentin.

				HARRY
		Lock up, will you?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

	ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

	Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
	building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

	The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

				HARRY
		A Mister Quaid?

				TOFFLER
		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
		saw it on the news. Jennifer
		doesn't know.  And frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

				HARRY
		I won't say anything.

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

	Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
	distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's been with us four years. 
		She was coming on nicely. 
		But just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

				HARRY
		What's her problem?

				TOFFLER
		She has no real grip on reality.

				HARRY
			(a joke)
		Does anybody?

				TOFFLER
			(deadly serious)
		Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
		real and what's not. That's what
		holds us together.

				HARRY
		And what does Jennifer think's
		real?

	They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
	outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

				TOFFLER
			(quietly)
		Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		Jennifer?

	Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

	Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
	the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

				JENNIFER
		Have we met before?

				HARRY
		No.

				JENNIFER
		Only I forget.  They give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... I forget things,

				HARRY
		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
		came because I wanted to know if
		you knew a man called Butterfield.

				JENNIFER
		Maybe... I... don't...

				HARRY
		What about Philip Swann?

				JENNIFER
		I knew Swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		He's a fucking liar.

	A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

				HARRY
		Why's that?

				JENNIFER
		He said he knew how to protect us. 
		But he didn't know anything.  He
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

				HARRY
		What is?

				JENNIFER
			(tears nearing)
		I don't want to think about it. If
		I think about it he'll hear me. 
		He'll find me.

				HARRY
		Swann?

	Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

				JENNIFER
		I told you.  I don't --

	She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

	The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		God no!  Oh God no!

	She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

				NURSE
		Calm down!

	She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
	back.

				JENNIFER
		He's not going to get me!

	She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
		He's not!  He's not!

				HARRY
		Who's not? 

	He catches up with her.

				JENNIFER
		Nix! Nix!

				HARRY
		Is he the Puritan?

				JENNIFER
		Yes! Yes!

				HARRY
		And he's dead?

				JENNIFER
		No.  He's coming back.  He's
		digging his way out!

	The Nurse appears behind Harry.

				NURSE
		I'll take care of her now.

	Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

				NURSE
		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

	The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

				HARRY
		Jennifer!

	She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
	Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

	HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

	Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

				HARRY
		Jesus.

	He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
	His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

				HARRY
			(very quietly)
		Jesus.

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

	The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

	Harry's on the phone.



				HARRY
		I want to speak to Dorothea.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I'm afraid she's not in.

				HARRY
		When will she be in?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin on the phone in the study.

				DOROTHEA
		Who is it?

	Valentin puts the phone down.

				VALENTIN
		Crank call.  I'll get the number
		changed.

				DOROTHEA
		No word from D'Amour?			    

	Valentin shakes his head.

				VALENTIN
		It's better he's gone.  He would
		have done more harm than good.

				DOROTHEA
		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
		so.  Try him again at the hotel.

				VALENTIN
		I left three messages already.

	Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
	and leaves the room.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

				HARRY
			(on phone)
		Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I
		wanted to get into the repository
		at the Magic Castle?

				CUT TO:

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT        

	THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS. 

	PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
	GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
	LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

				HARRY
		You've done this before.

				BILLY
		I've had my moments.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Harry's manipulating the lock.

				BILLY
		I'm sure they'll have this place
		rigged.

				HARRY
		How?

				BILLY
		It'll be something hokey. 

	CLICK! The door opens.

				BILLY
		Houdini'd been proud of you.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

				BILLY
			(impressed)
		Whoa...

	On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
	IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
	while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

				BILLY
		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

				HARRY
		You heard right.

				BILLY
		You ever been married?

				HARRY
		Yeah.  She was killed in a car
		crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
		was filing for divorce.

				BILLY
		Why?

				HARRY
		My life was too weird for her.

				BILLY
			(grinning)
		I love weird.

	Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

				HARRY
		Billy?  This was on Miller's
		forehead.  Any idea what it is?

				BILLY
		Nope.

	Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

				BILLY
		What did I tell you?  So fucking
		hokey.

	Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

				HARRY
		What have we got here?

	Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

				HARRY
		Grab the files!

	Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
	steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
	CLANG!

				BILLY
		Jesus!

	He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

				BILLY
		I could have lost my fucking hands.

				HARRY
		That would have kept you out of the
		Magic Circle.
			(he studies the files)
		Which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		These are about Nix.

	Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

				HARRY
		You go through these.  Go on!

	Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
	PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
	painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
	There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is NIX.

				HARRY
		Wait a minute...

	He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
	colours.

				HARRY
		That's Butterfield...

				BILLY
			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		And who's that?

	ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

				HARRY
		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

	Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
	of another man's HEAD.

				BILLY
		Take a look at this.

				HARRY
			(looking at it)
		A Nix specialty?

	Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
	glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
	his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
	beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
	a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
	DARKNESS.

				BILLY
		I don't know any of these tricks...

	Harry studies the etchings.

				HARRY
			(a slow burn)
		Maybe they're not tricks.

				BILLY
			(mystified)
		I mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what Harry said)
		What do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

				HARRY
		What did Vinovich say? Something
		about walking a path between --

				BILLY
		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
		says that all the time.

				HARRY
		That's because he knew.  He'd seen
		these files and knew.

				BILLY
		Knew what?

	Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
	Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	Harry takes out his gun. 

	Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	The TRACK is completely silent. 

	Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
	backs away.

				BILLY
		Harry!

	Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck are you?

	Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

				HARRY
		Okay.  Hold it right there.

	The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

	But it's still terrorizing Billy.

				BILLY
			(in mortal terror)
		Get it off me!

	Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
	books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
	vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

				HARRY
		Hokey enough for you?

				BILLY
		I'm out of here, man!  Are you
		coming?

	Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

				HARRY
		I'm coming.

	Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	As he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

				HARRY
		Ah, shaddup!

	He FIRES at the projector a second time.

	On the GUN SHOT --

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

	Billy and Harry are parting.

				HARRY
		Thanks, Billy.

				BILLY
		Hey, anytime.
			(a beat)
		Actually, no.  This was enough. 

	They shake, and part.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

				VALENTIN
			(quietly)
		I can't let you in.

			(stepping in)
		Yeah, I know.

				VALENTIN
		You want more money, is that it?

	Harry pushes him aside.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

				HARRY

	He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts

		Shut up!

	He pushes open the door.

	The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
	Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

				DOROTHEA
		This is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
		meddling with his body...

	Harry approaches, slowly.

				DOROTHEA
		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
		used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		Why did you come back?

				HARRY
		I didn't leave.  I was just digging
		around.

	Dorothea looks up at him.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		What did you find?

				HARRY
		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		She threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh Christ.

				HARRY
			(a beat)
		Why don't you tell me the truth?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

	Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
	PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

				HARRY
		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
		Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

				DOROTHEA
		It was more than that, I think.

				HARRY
		He was the real thing, right?

				DOROTHEA
		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

				HARRY
		Stuff?

				DOROTHEA
		He could get into people's heads. 
		Make them see things. Terrible
		things.  And he could levitate. 
		Juggle fire.

				HARRY
		He taught all this to Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		Some or it.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin is listening at the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

				HARRY
		So Swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(Dorothea nods)
		And what?  You thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

				DOROTHEA
		I told you --

				HARRY
		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		Including yours.

				DOROTHEA
		No.

				HARRY
		You said you weren't with him for
		love.

				DOROTHEA
		I wasn't.

				HARRY
		 What then?

				DOROTHEA
		I was grateful to him.  I owed him
		my life.  And he loved me. He
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

				HARRY
		He thought Nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
	from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
	stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

				DOROTHEA
		Shit!

	They are very close to each other.

				HARRY
			(reassuring)
		It's okay.

				DOROTHEA
		No it isn't.  You can't help me.

				HARRY
			(tenderly)
		I'm here, aren't I?

	He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

				HARRY
		Nothing's going to happen to you.  

				DOROTHEA
			(seductive)
		Nothing?

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Nothing you don't want. 

	They kiss again, passionately.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
	the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
	to the phone and dials.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
	flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
	Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

	It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

	INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
	palms churn against the night sky...

	INTERCUT

	Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
	of Harry and Dorothea.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

				DOROTHEA
			(whispers)
		I was so afraid.

				HARRY
		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you sure?

				HARRY
		I'm sure.
			(kisses her)
		He's dead.

				DOROTHEA
		I know.  I'm the one who shot
		him.

	ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

				DOROTHEA
		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
		to get Swann to come to him.

				HARRY
			(realizing)
		And they all came...

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Quaid and Jennifer--

				DOROTHEA
		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
		ready for them.

	There's a NOISE downstairs.

				DOROTHEA
			(nervous)
		What was that?

				HARRY
		It's okay. 

	Harry slips out of bed.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  He has his gun.

				HARRY
		Valentin? 

	Dorothea appears behind him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?  Wait!

	Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

				HARRY
		What the hell-?

	Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
	ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
	skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
	skull.

				HARRY
			(in pain)
		Aah!

	Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
	Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

				DOROTHEA
		It's him!  It's Nix!

	Harry goes out into the passageway.

				HARRY
		Valentin!  Get some lights on!

	As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
	erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
	"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
	physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
	writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
	it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
	leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     

	The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
	Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
	he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
	Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the CASKET.

				HARRY
		Somebody you know?

	Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God!

	The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
	gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

				HARRY
		Which goes first?  My face or
		your heart?

	The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
	and dies.

				DOROTHEA
		Who in God's name are you?

	She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you all right?

				HARRY
		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
		in here!

	Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
	to force off the lid. 

	Valentin and Dorothea enter.

				VALENTIN
		What are you doing?  This is
		sacrilege.

	He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	Inside, Swann's corpse.

				VALENTIN
		Are you satisfied now?

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		It's all right.  It's not
		hurting...

	He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

				HARRY
		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		It looks like you're not a widow
		after all.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
	binds Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		You rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		You paid off the doctor.  You set
		up the fake body.  Yes?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		And then... because I was
		getting too close to something --
			(at Dorothea)
		--or someone, you called Swann

				VALENTIN
		I tried to pay you off.

				HARRY
		Was that Swann's idea?

				VALENTIN
		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
		any more bloodshed. That's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for Nix to come
		after.

				HARRY
		Nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

				VALENTIN
		Haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	Nix's resurrection is plausible.

				HARRY
		I want to see Swann face to face.

				VALENTIN
		Why don't you leave this alone? Let
		everybody think it's over?

				DOROTHEA
		What about me?

				VALENTIN
		Nix was never interested in you. 
		It was always Swann. 

	A beat.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
		let it alone. 

	A BELL starts to TOLL-

				HARRY
			(con't.)
		He went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	The TOLLING carries over into

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
	MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
	Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
	Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
	Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
	the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
	she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
	are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
	in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
	dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

	Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
	"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
	down into the street.

				1ST WORKER
		Watch out!

	On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
	We don't see who.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
	cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

	Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

	The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

	On Harry, as he gets into his.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

				VALENTIN
		Who's there?

	He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
	He swings round.  Too late.

	Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
	to the ground.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(conversationally)
		I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
		another profession, I would have
		been a surgeon.

	On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

	Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

				BUTTERFIELD
		To be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

				VALEMTIN
		No. . .

				BUTTERFIELD
		Let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

				VALENTIN
		Please.

				BUTTERFIELD
		I could scoop them out.

				VALENTIN
		Don't.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So tell me where Nix is buried.

				VALENTIN
		I don't know.

	Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

	CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	Butterfield's body.

				VALENTIN
		Wait!

	On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

				VALENTIN
		I'll tell you.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You'll do more.than that.

	EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

	A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

	Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
	inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.

	INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY		   

	It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
	are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
	Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

	Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
	the Stranger. 

	He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

	As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
	GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

	INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

	Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

	Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

				HARRY
		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

				HARRY
		You had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	Silence.

				HARRY
		A lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		They'll never find out. 

	Harry looks up.

	Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

				HARRY
		Look, Ma, no wires.

				SWANN
		You shouldn't have followed me,
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		How the fuck do you do that?

				SWANN
		Now I'm going to have to kill you.

				HARRY
		I don't think so.  You need me
		alive.

				SWANN
		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

	Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

				HARRY
		Be careful.  Funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	Swann stops, inches from the ground.

				HARRY
		You know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  You can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

				SWANN
		Illusionists get. Las Vegas
		contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
		burned.

				HARRY
		Or murdered, like Nix.

				SWANN
		He deserved it.

				HARRY
		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		Maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  That's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

				SWANN
		I did it for Dorothea.

				HARRY
		Oh yeah?

				SWANN
		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
	they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

				HARRY
		So Nix won't come looking for her?

				SWANN
		It's me betrayed him.

				HARRY
		And she shot him I  I think that'd
		piss me off if I were Nix.

				SWANN
			(despairing)
		I don't know what else to do.

				HARRY
		Help me.

	On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

				HARRY
		Listen.  If he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		And he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		And if he's just another phony
		Messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
	are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
	SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

	We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
	see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
	Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
	grins.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
	the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
	the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
	brandy.

				SWANN
		Is this the best brandy you've
		got?

				CASHIER
		If that's what's on the shelves.

	Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

				SWANN
		Can you change a thousand for me?

				CASHIER
			(amazed)
		You're shittin' me.

				HARRY
		Can we go?

	Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

				HARRY
		Oh Jeez.

				SWANN
		Will that do?  No?

	Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
	QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

				SWANN
		That better? 

	The Cashier gapes.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

	The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
	struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

				SHOCK CUT TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

	CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
	crazed. 

	Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
	shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
	runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

	NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
	falling gouts of dark fluid --

	-- she struggles, SOBBING --
			 CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She tosses around on the bed

				BACK TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
	from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
	SPLASHES on her upturned face --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets
	up and goes out onto --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

	Looks down the stairs.

				DOROTHEA
		Who's there?

	Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry.

	BLOOD runs from his cut face.

				DOROTHEA
		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
		to your face?

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		It was me.

	She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
	against the wail.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Guess who we're going to see?

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

	Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
	stares at Harry.

				SWANN
		You think I'm an asshole.

				HARRY
		Didn't know you read minds.

				SWANN
			(a warning)
		I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
		But you know that.
			(an apology)
		So I like playing games with
		people.  Gives them something to
		wonder about...

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		I distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. It's like a
		public service.  It doesn't mean
		much in the end. They're all going
		to die.

				HARRY
		And you're not? 

	Silence for a moment.

				SWANN
		Oh, I was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  That's why
		I liked Nix.  He promised me all
		these explanations.

				HARRY
		And he didn't have them?

				SWANN
		He had something.  He showed me how
		to bend the rules.  A little
		levitation.  A few fireworks.

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		No.
			(a beat)
		At the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. He
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
		Shit...

				HARRY
		And you believed him?

				SWANN
		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		See, that's his best trick.  No
		illusions.  Just the truth.
			(he looks at Harry)
		Are you ready for that? 

	Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

				SWANN
		Hey!

	Harry drinks.

				SWANN
		Thought not.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

	PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
	door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

				SWANN
		She's not here.

	Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

				HARRY
		Did she know where Nix was buried?

				SWANN
		No.

				HARRY
		Who else did?  Did Valentin?

				SWANN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Jesus!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT	 

	Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
	stars.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       

	Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
	Dorothea is handcuffed. 

	He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Like the look of these?  I made
		them myself, to set him free.

				DOROTHEA
		Why did you wait so long?

				BUTTERFIELD
		I didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  I had to teach
		myself.  And that took time.

				DOROTHEA
		And you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

				BUTTERFIELD
		If he was just a man like me, then
		no.  But he's not.

				DOROTHEA
		What is he?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Maybe he'll show you.

	ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

	There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

	It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
	We DRIFT towards the front door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

	Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
	CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
	blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
	indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
	eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
	ears and scalps.

	And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

				NORMAN
		He will come!  He will come! He
		will come!

	EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

	The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Anything?

				VALENTIN (V.0.)
		Not yet.

	Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

				BUTTERFIELD
		If you've lied to me to me --

				VALENTIN
		I swear... this is the place Swann
		told me about.  The rocks...

	On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	Valentin.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
		you'd better not --

	A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

				BUTTERFIELD
		What the fuck are you playing at?

	He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
	Opens a WOUND across his arm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
	Twice.  Then --

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Butterfield!

	Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

				VALENTIN
			(blinded)
		In the corner...

	The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Valentin)
		Keep away from it.

	Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
	He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

	Closer... 

	Closer... 

	He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
	ROAR!

	He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

				VALENTIN
		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(reverentially)
		It's him... it's him.

	On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	The car is static; the engine still running.

				HARRY
		They got here before us.

				SWANN
		Looks that way.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

	HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

	Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
	in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
	Harry slides into the grave.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
	and scramble out.

				HARRY
		Swann?  Swann!

	Silence.

	Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
	round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

				VALENTIN
		D'Amour --

				HARRY
		Shit...

				VALENTIN
		Help me.

	He collapses into Harry's arms.

				HARRY
		Swann!

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
	to help?

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Swann!

	He decides.  Gets out.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

	Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

				HARRY
		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

	Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

				VALENTIM
		He's got Dorothea. 

				SWANN
		And Nix?

				VALENTIN
		Him too.

				HARRY
		We've got to get you to a hospital.

				VALENTIN
		Don't bother.

				HARRY
		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
		already.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry, D'Amour...

				HARRY
		What about?

				VALENTIN
		... Looks like you're going...
		to lose... one more.

	Valentin dies.

				HARRY
			(despairing)
		... no...

				SWANN
		He's better off this way.

				HARRY
			(furious)
		Nobody's better off this wav!

				SWANN
		You don't get it, do you? We're
		shit. D'Amour.

	He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
	Nix's grave.

				SWANN
		That's where we're all going.

				HARRY
		In my time, and nobody else's.

	ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
	getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
	retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is silent now.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

	ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
	WHITE now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Do you wish him to be amongst us?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Will you come to him on your
		knees?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Be ready.

	Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
	With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
	MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of GLASS. 

	ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
	BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
	Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
	head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

	ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
	into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

				DOROTHEA
		Listen.  You've got everything you
		want.  You don't need me. .. 

	A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
	POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

				BUTTERFIELD
		No, but he will.  After what you
		did to him.

	He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
		that.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
	breathless with anticipation.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

	On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

	And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

	On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The whisper runs through the congregation:

				CULTISTS
		He's coming home... he/s coming
		home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

				DOROTHEA
		Christ in Heaven.

	ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
	THROB. 

	Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				CULTISTS
		He's with us... He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
	TRACK. 

	Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

	Butterfield looks up. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Hold her!

	On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
	comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
	his eyes.

	NIX'S P.O.V.

	The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

				NIX
			(fury to agony)
		Aaarrrgh!

	He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
	literally ROARS in rage.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
	repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
	shards of glass now, crazed.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
	getting out.  Swann stays put. 

	The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

				HARRY
			(spooked)
		Jesus... what the hell's going on
		in there?

				SWANN
		At a guess... they just resurrected
		him.

				HARRY
		Fuck.

	Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
	of the car and follows.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
	for the count. 

	On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
	disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

	The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

				NIX
		Children...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

				NIX
		Will you suffer to come unto me?

	One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
	agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

	Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

				NIX
		I've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  Will you hear it?

				CULTISTS
		Yes... yes...

				NIX
		Follow me then.

	He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

				NIX
		Do I know you, child?

	He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

				NIX
		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		Where's Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where he is.

	Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


				NIX
		He'll come.  We've got unfinished
		business, he and I.

	Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
	Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	The Cultists follow.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Nix strides into the middle of the room.

				NIX
			(whispered to Dorothea)
		Something terrible's going to
		happen.  But if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		Are you ready for my wisdom?

				CULTISTS
		Tell us... tell us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
	He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
	terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
	the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

				SWANN
			(in terrified awe)
		This is where we killed him.

				HARRY
			(looking at table)
		You didn't try hard enough.

				SWANN
		I can't... I can't go any
		further...

	Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
	grip.  He crosses to the door. 

	Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
	Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

				NIX
		Here is my wisdom.

	He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
	directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
	power.

				BARBARA
		Show us. Puritan.

				NORMAN
		Yes, show us!

				ALL
		Show us!  Show us!

	With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
	Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
	perhaps bottomless. 

	Dorothea SCREAMS!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
	passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
	hold of his arm.

				SWANN
			(to Harry)
		Whatever he's doing to her, stop
		him!

	And Harry's up and away --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	-- he dashes over the glass --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

				NIX
			(to unseen Cultists)
		You see, I escaped the grave. So I
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

				NORMAN
		What's happening?

				NIX
		I have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
	They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

				BARBARA
			(sobbing)
		Why?  Why?

				NIX
		You're not worthy.  None of you. 
		Only Swann was worthy. You just
		waited like lambs.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.

				NIX
		Well I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
	ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
	and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
	gaze.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
	resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
	is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

				SWANN
		Aah!

				BUTTERFIELD
		Go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at Swann
		again)
		Go on!  Go on!

	Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
	wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
	the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(screaming)
		No!

	He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
	running from his wound.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	Nix swings round.

				NIX
		You're not Swann.  Who are you?
			(a beat) )
		Oh... I know what you want. He lets
		Dorothea slip from his arms.  

	Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
	Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

				HARRY
		Hang on!

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contact

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Nix!

	Nix looks up.

				NIX
		There you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

				NIX
		I've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

				SWANN
		And?

				NIX
		I should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  I wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  I was born to murder
		the world.

	ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
	back into the room.

				NIX
		You could still help me do that.

				SWANN
		Why would I want to?

				NIX
		Because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

				SWANN
		Not true.

				NIX
		The woman has a new love in her
		life.  Your friends are dead.
		Nobody's left to save you, but me

	He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		I've got to help him.

				DOROTHEA
		You can't.

				HARRY
		Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		Everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Bastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

				NIX
		Will you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Nix lets him go.

				NIX
		You know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.

				SWANN
		Yes.

				NIX
		But until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

				NIX
		Wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

				SWANN
		No!

				NIX
		Liar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

				NIX
		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
	one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
	Dorothea.

				NIX
		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
		I'll show you!

	He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

				SWANN
		Harry!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Harry!  Stop him!

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

				NIX (V.O.)
		Where is she? 

	Harry turns.

	Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
	body as he comes at Harry!

				NIX
		Where did she go?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.

				NIX
		You've got Swann's disease. You
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		Wrong!

	His fingers slide all the way in!

				HARRY
		Oh God!

	Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
	are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

				NIX
		Tell me where she is... and I'll
		make it go away...

	Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
	SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

	ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

				HARRY
		Oh God... oh God...

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
	face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

	ON HARRY

	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	Reaching out for the image.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The Woman reaches for Harry.

				WOMAN           
		Help me.

	ON HARRY

	as he touches the wall.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!

	He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!  Dorothea!

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
	screaming when she disappears.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	ON HARRY 

	literally beating his head against the wall!

				HARRY
		No!  No!  No!

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry...

	Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

				DOROTHEA
		It's not real, Harry-

	Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

	ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
	fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


				HARRY
		... oh... God...

				DOROTHEA
		I'm here, Harry.

				HARRY
		...yes?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

	Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

				NIX
			(to Dorothea)
		There you are, child. 

	Harry starts to look round.

				DOROTHEA
		Don't look.

				HARRY
		I... have... to.

				NIX
		Come on, child.  I want Swann to
		see you die. 

	Harry turns and looks at Nix.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
	of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

				NIX
			(to Harry)
		What are you looking at?

	ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
	and now slips inside. 

	ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

	ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
	hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

				HARRY
			(points to his brow)
		There... there!

	ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

	ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

	The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
	BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
	used to be.

	ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
	wall, shaking.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		I'm okay.  I'm okay.

	Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
	actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
	kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
	up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
	forehead --

				NIX
		One... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God.

	Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

	Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
	stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

				SWANN (V.O.)
		... D'Amour...

	Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
	Swann is on the threshold. 

	Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the Meditation Room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
	backed towards it by Nix. 

	When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
	DEMONIACAL.

				NIX
		I am the purest of the pure.  I am
		the darkest of the dark...

	Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

				SWANN
		Harry.  You can't kill him. 

	Harry crouches beside Swann.

				HARRY
			(whispers)
		He did something with the ground.

				SWANN
		Yes?

				HARRY
		Can you do it?

				SWANN
		I don't know.

				HARRY
		Try.

	ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

				NIX (V.O.)
		I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
		Hell.

	Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	Nix topples.

	ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

	A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Get out of here!

	The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
	Harry, of course. 

	Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

				NIX
		No!  No!  No!

	He's at the edge of the pit.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
	reaches for Harry, as -- 

	-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

	Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
	They look back to see 

	NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

	At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
	closes his eyes.

				CUT TO:

	INT. THE PIT

	What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
	death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

	Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
	against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
	smithereens.  And as he falls --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Is it finished?

				HARRY
		I think so.

	No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth. 

	And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
	approaching MAGMA.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Come on...

	She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
	relief.

	INT. THE PIT

	Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
	disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
	spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				HARRY
		What the fuck? 

				DOROTHEA
		Harry-?

				HARRY
		Out!  Out! 

	They race for the front door --

	INT. THE PIT

	-- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at
	a breath-taking rate

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off
	the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the
	resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the
	house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down. 

	ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN

	The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN

	The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE
	reigns.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at
	the house.  Nothing.

				HARRY
			(quietly)
		It's finished.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN

	ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE

          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

                    FRODO
          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

                      BILBO
          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!

                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.

          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

                    GANDALF
          The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (softly)
          Until our next meeting.

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    GANDALF

          He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

          ...my own.

          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

                    GANDALF
          This is the one ring forged by the dark
          lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt
          Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of
          Sauron himself.

CLOSE ON: FRODO...STUNNED

                    FRODO
              (quiet realization)
          Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.

                    GANDALF
          For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
          Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
          delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
          awoken. It has heard its master's call.

emanates from the Ring.   Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing
the other has heard it.

          But he was destroyed...Sauron was
          destroyed.

ANGLE ON: THE RING

lies between them on the table.

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
          the Ring.

          Alright!

            My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
            creatures. You can learn all that there
            is to know about their ways in a month,
            and yet, after a hundred years, they can

                    GANDALF
          A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.

                     SARUMAN
          Why?   Why should we fear to use it?

                    GANDALF
          They are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the Palantir.

                    SARUMAN
          The hour is later than you think.
          Sauron's forces are already moving...the
          Nine have left Minas Morgul.

                    GANDALF
              (shocked)
          The nine!

                    SARUMAN
          They crossed the river Isen in
          Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    GANDALF
              (alarmed)
          They have reached the Shire? Saruman
          shrugs...

                    SARUMAN
          They will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          You did not seriously think a Hobbit
          could contend with the will of Sauron?
          There are none who can.

Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Against the power of Mordor, there can be
          no victory. We must join with him,
          Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
          would be wise, my friend.

                    GANDALF
              (deadly)
          Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                    SARUMAN
          I gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.

Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     SAM
               (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    FRODO
              (teasing)
          What are you talking about?

                    SAM
              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Oh.

                    SAM

          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

                      FRODO
          Nothing.

                    PIPPIN
          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

                      SAM
          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    FRODO
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    MERRY
          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

                    MERRY (CONT'D)

          Get the ropes, Sam.

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?

          What do you want?

                    FRODO

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business

          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

mug of beer.

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

          What do you want?

                    STRIDER
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.

                    FRODO
          I carry nothing.

                    STRIDER
          Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
          if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    FRODO
          Who are you?

                    STRIDER
          Are you frightened?

                    FRODO
          Yes.

                    STRIDER
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

                    SAM
              (angry)
          Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

                    STRIDER
          You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...You can

          Where are they?

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
          Power. Blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.

                    STRIDER (CONT'D)
          They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
          living or dead. At all times they feel
          the presence of the ring...drawn to the
          power of the one..they will never stop
          hunting you.

          We've had one, yes...but what about
          Second Breakfast?

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

                                           IN THE REAL WORLD:

...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (horrified)
          Frodo!

Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop
summit.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo!!

Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Help him, Strider!

                     STRIDER
              (grim)
          He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
          Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing
          into the air like smoke. Strider throws
          the hilt down in disgust...

          Do something.

                    STRIDER
          This is beyond my skill to heal.
              (urgently)
          He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
          Frodo onto his shoulders.

EXT. WEATHERHILLS -- NIGHT

Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his
back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The
hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.

                    STRIDER
          Hurry!

                    SAM
          We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
          groans.

                    STRIDER
          Hold on, Frodo.

                     SAM
          He'll never make it! Close on:
          Frodo...head lolling about, barely
          conscious.

          Gandalf...Gandalf?

EXT. ISENGARD -- NIGHT

Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard,
gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the
once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with
smoke and fire billowing out

of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.

It suddenly flutters away. CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the
Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down,
towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red
tunnel!

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- NIGHT

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

          Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is
          getting shallow. Strider looks out into
          the darkness.

                    STRIDER
          No. He is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

                    MERRY
              (nervous)
          They're close.

Frodo gasps in sudden pain.

          Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam

          Athelas?

          Kingsfoil.

          He's fading...he's not gong to last. We
          must get him to my father. Strider

          horse.

                    ARWEN (CONT'D)

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing

          You have found your way to the last
          homely house east of the sea. The elves
          of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
          for three thousand years through few of
          my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from
          his balcony.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. RIVENDELL GARDENS -- DAY

Frodo and Sam walk together. Suddenly, the voices of Merry
and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw
their arms around him.

                     MERRY
          Frodo!   Frodo!

Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a
bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's
gaze...

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!

EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE -- DAY

Close on: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks in to a broad grin as
Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged
significantly since we last saw him.

                    BILBO
          Hello, Frodo, my lad!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!

LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (reading)
          "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
          by Bilbo Baggins.

Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace
overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of
beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          This is wonderful.

                    BILBO
          I meant to go back...wander the paths of
          Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
          Mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          I miss the Shire...I spent all my
          childhood pretending I was off somewhere
          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (Looks at Bilbo)
          But my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...I'm not like you,
          Bilbo.

                    BILBO
          My dear boy...

EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE -- EVENING

Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.

                    SAM
          No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to
          reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching Sam.

                    FRODO
          Packed already?

Sam looks up, startled.

                    SAM
              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

                    FRODO
          I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
          Sam?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

          I do...

                    FRODO
          More than anything.

                    SAM
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    FRODO
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
          ready to go home.

EXT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,

                    ELROND
          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

                    GANDALF
          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

                                                               70.



FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,

ENTRANCED.

                       ELROND
             I was there the day the strength of Men
             failed.

             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
             Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
             place it could be destroyed.

CLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING.

                         ISILDUR
             No.

Isildur turns and walks away

                         ELROND
             Isildur!!

INT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY

Elrond turns to Gandalf.

                       ELROND
             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

          He has chosen exile.

Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.

Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          replaces the Broken blade, but it
          clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
          away, leaving Strider sitting alone.

Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.

                    ARWEN
          Why do you fear the past? You are
          Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
          are not bound to his fate.

          Strangers from distant lands ... friends

          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

                    GIMLI
          I will be dead before I see the Ring in
          the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT
          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    GANDALF
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And you have my bow.

                    GIMLI
          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

                    MERRY
          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road
          turns east, to Mordor.

                    PIPPIN
          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    BOROMIR

          ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what
          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

                    GANDALF
              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          We must take the pass of Caradhras!

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should
          suffer so much fear and doubt over so
          small a thing...such a little thing.

                    ARAGORN

Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum

Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring
back to Frodo.

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir

out Shivering and Fearful.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You know what they awoke in, the darkness
          of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

                    GANDALF
          Let the ringbearer decide.

CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's
arms.

                      GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Frodo?

Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.

                    FRODO
          We will go through the mines. Gandalf
          slowly nods.

                      GANDALF
          So be it.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark
lake...directly below great looming cliffs.

                    GIMLI
              (in awe)
          The walls of Moria!

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.

                     GANDALF
          Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
          moonlight.

A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow
Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing
ancient letters and symbols.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
          Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

                    MERRY
          What do you suppose that means?

                    GANDALF
              (confident)
          It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
          speak the password and the doors will
          open.

Gandalf raises his arms...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (incanting)
          Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!

                                                         LATER:

GANDALF CONTINUES...

Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un-
saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill
the Pony.

                    ARAGORN
              (whispering)
          Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
          so brave as Bill.

                       SAM
          Bye, Bill.

                    ARAGORN
          Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he
          knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on
          the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE
          ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    SAM
          Goodbye, Bill.

SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             86.
CONTINUED:


                    ARAGORN
              (ominous)
          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           87.
CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             88.
CONTINUED:


A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN
          Are we lost?

CONTINUED:


                    MERRY
          No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,
          Gandalf's thinking.

                    PIPPIN
          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             92.

                      GANDALF
            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

CONTINUED:


Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel

          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a

                    LEGOLAS
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

                     ARAGORN
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

            the tower guards shall take up the call

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      FRODO
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         104.
CONTINUED:


                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                         105.



INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY

Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.
CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            107.
CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           108.
CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         109.
CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!
            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

             It must be getting late.

             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

             Come on, must go, no time ...

             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

                        GIMLI
                  (suddenly interested)
             Salted pork?

                        GANDALF
                  (shaking his head)
             Hobbits!

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his
ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e PA LAN TIR !

                 (urgent)
            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled.

EXT. EDORAS - DAY

WIDE: BACK SHOT - a GROUP OF RIDERS gallop towards the ROHAN
CITY of EDORAS . . .

PUSH IN: EOWYN standing alone outside the GOLDEN HALL,
waiting . . .

                                                               CUT

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES
laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for
the returning soldiers.

                       THEODEN
            Tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. Hail the
            victorious dead!

ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards
ARAGORN . . . As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                       EOWYN
            Westu Aragorn hal.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

                        EOWYN
                  (smiling)
             You are both honourable men.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       T HE ODE N ( co nt' d)
             Don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES . . . both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
                  (singing)
             Oh, you can search - up and down
             As many lands as can be found
             But you'll never find a beer so brown
             As the one we drink in our home town
             You can keep your fancy ales
             You can drink them by the flagon
             But the only brew, for the brave and true,
             Comes from the Green Dragon!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

                    ARAGORN
          No news of Frodo?

                     GANDALF
          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

                     ARAGORN
               (gently)
          What does your heart tell you?

                     GANDALF
               (with a small smile)
          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

                  (hissed whisper)
             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

                        GOLLUM.,               .     ,.·
             What is it saying,.my Precious, my love? Is .
             Smeagol losing his nerve??

                        SMEAGOL                 :
             No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -
             dead!

                         GOLLUM
             And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . .
                  (sly)
             . . . He can do it again.

FLASH INSERT: SMEAGOL choking DEAGOL . . . Fingers locked tight
around his THROAT.

                      SMEAGOL
           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

                      GOLLUM
                (prompting)
           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

           Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
           we come to . . .
                 (naughty excitement)

                      GOLLUM
                (quiet)
           And when they go in, there's no coming out.
           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

                      SMEAGOL
           And they doesn't taste very nice, does
           they, Precious?               .

                (sinister)
           No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She

           "Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
           bones and the empty clothes, then we will

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

                  (urgent)
             He is here.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,

                        GANDALF
             Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                        MERRY
             Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

                        PIPPIN
             Gandalf! Forgive me.

                       GANDALF             .

          courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!

FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

                        PIPPIN (cont'd)
             The city was burning ...

             Minas Tirith???
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Is that what you saw?

                         PIPPIN
                  (terrified)
             I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his
             voice in my head.

                     GANDALF
          And what did you tell him? Speak!

                        PIPPIN
          He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he
          hurt me . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING
INTENSITY . . .

                    GANDALF
          What did you tell him about Frodo and the
          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    GANDALF (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN
                (low and urgent)
           I will go.

                        GANDALF
                 (hurried)
           No!

                      ARAGORN
           They must be warned.

                      GANDALF
           They will be.
                (low voice, to Aragorn)

                (louder, to all)
           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

          How far is Minas Tirith?

          Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
          you'd better hope we don't have one of
          those on our tail.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

                     MERRY
          Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

          The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

                     MERRY

          much, Pip.

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,

             It has begun.

             This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your

EXT. FOOTHILLS OF WHITE MOUNTAINS - DAY

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

                      GANDALF
           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;

             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

             dead?

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering . . .

INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body,
he falls to his KNEES . . .

PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing . . .

                       .. PIPPIN
             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                        GANDALF
                  (hurried whisper)
             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!
                  (a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)
             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF . . .

            You still have friends - you are not alone
            in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

                      DENETHOR (cont'd)
                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF
                (stung)
           Authority is not given to you to deny the
           return of the King - Steward!

                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape

             There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out

like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.

                        SAM
             No, Mr Frodo!

                  (desperate)
             Not that way!

SAM runs after FRODO, catching him in his arms as he STUMBLES,

                       GOLLUM (cont'd)
             What's it doing?

                        SAM
             No!

SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE.

                        FRODO
                  (disorientated)
             They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,
as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of
BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

EXT. MINAS MORGUL - NIGHT

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against
their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH . . .
SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the
range of hearing. The terrible CRY ends, falling back through
a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL
- the WITCH KING - suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on
his FELL-BEAST!

MORGUL. His DARK HEAD turns this way and that, sweeping the
shadows with unseen eyes - as if SENSING the RING !

ANGLE ON: 75,000 ORCS MARCHING TO WAR, just below FRODO and SAM.

                        GANDALF V/0
             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his
ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow.

                       GANDALF
             Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
             be done. Another opportunity for one of the
             Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand
on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             You must not fail me.

GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER ·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM
           Come, Master.

CLOSE ON: FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE . . . as he
does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL
VIEW of GOLLUM!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock . . . tenses like a CAT,
EYES WIDENING.

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (dreamlike)
             Come to Smeagol.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                        SAM
                  (alarmed yell)
             Mr Frodo!

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                       GOLLUM
             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

           Master carries heavy burden . . . Smeagol
           knows . . . Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
           cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his
ear:

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (rasping whisper)
           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
           in   his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
           it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
           it   from you.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM . . . his hand strays to his
NECK, closing tight around the RING.

             I do not think we should so lightly abandon

                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor

                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been

            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD
. .. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open . . . GOLLUM spins around,

             What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

                        SMEAGOL
                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.

                  (sly)
             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             Grimbold, how many?

                        GRIMBOLD
             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

                        ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.)
             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                        DENETHOR
                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                        GAMLING ( O . S . )
             None have come, My Lord.

ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT

TWILIGHT HAZE.

                         THEODEN
                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

             Every hour lost hastens Condor's defeat. We
             have till dawn. Then we must ride.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no
matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning.
THEODEN nods.

The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance ... THEODEN looks up
at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ANGLE ON: HORSES rearing in terror as ROHAN SOLDIERS try to
quieten them ...

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP . . .

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS . . .
they sit quiet and hunched ... no-one speaking ...

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE ...

                        LEGOLAS
                  (uneasy)
             The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.
             quiet ..?

                          EOMER
             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             None who venture there ever return.
                  (under his breath)
             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

ARAGORN POV: A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom
... ARAGORN starts in fright as . . .

                        GIMLI O.S
             Aragorn!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF . . .

                        GIMLI
             Let's find some food.

ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING
STONES before following GIMLI.

INT. EOWYN'S TENT, DUNHARROW - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: EOWYN kneels before MERRY, adjusting his HELMET
STRAP.

                        EOWYN
             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.
                  (despondent)
             It isn't even sharp.

             Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
             Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal ... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

                        EOWYN
             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

CLOSE ON: GAMLING stifles a laugh . . . EOWYN turns on both of
te .. .
 hm                                                      .

                        EOWYN
             Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
             much cause to go to war as you.
                  (to herself)
             Why can he not fight for those he loves?

In ARAGORN'S dream ARWEN suddenly WAKES ...

                        ARWEN V/0
             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could
             have seen him, one last time ...

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND
. . . A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY ...

                        GUARD
             King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

INT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON:- THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

                       THEODEN
             I take my leave.

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to
reveal ... ELROND.

                    ARAGORN
          My Lord, Elrond.

                       ELROND
             I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN ...

          Arwen is dying.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news ... ASHEN-FACED.

             She stayed?

                       ELROND
             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                       ELROND (cont'd)
             A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
             South.

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

                        ARAGORN
             There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT ...

           There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

                     ELROND (cont'd)
          Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from
          the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

                        ARAGORN
          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          Elendil . . .

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

                     A RAG OR N (c on t' d)
          . . . the blade that was broken shall return
          to Minas Tirith.

            The man who can wield the power of this
            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . .

            Put aside the Ranger - become who you were

 EOWYN             Why are you doing this?

ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her . . .

 EOWYN                   (hesitant)
             Do you not know?

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

 ARAGORN                   (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you
             love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.

EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK . . . she watches stricken as

hand.

 GIMLI              And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

 ARAGORN              Not this time ... This time you must stay,
             my friend.

 LEGOLAS O.S              Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of Dwarves?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading his
HORSE - already SADDLED.

 GIMLI              You might as well accept it - we're going

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

 GAMLING           Lord Aragorn!

 ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.           Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

 GAMLING           He leaves because there is no hope.

EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN 
ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

 THEODEN                 (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

 EOWYN            What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

 THEODEN                (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

 GIMLI              What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

 LEGOLAS              One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES. ' 
EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

WALL of ROCK towers . . .

 GIMLI                (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

 LEGOLAS                (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY. 
 ARAGORN           Brego!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR. 
 GIMLI              Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN 
ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE.

 THEODEN           We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM

 MERRY              All my friends have gone to battle. I would
             be ashamed to be left behind!

 THEODEN              It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

 MERRY              But . . . I want to fight!

 THEODEN              I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS. 
SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE! 
CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . .
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . .

. . . EOWYN, disguised as a MAN!

AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountain-
stone . . . and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK
lies a TUNNEL.

FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE.

 FRODO                   (exhausted)
             What is this place?

 GOLLUM              Master must go inside the tunnel.

 FRODO              Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL sensing his PLAN unravelling. Everything
depends on FRODO going inside the TUNNEL

 SMEAGOL              It's the only way.
                  (GOLLUM;- slyly)
             Go in - or go back.

FRODO stares into the darkness . . .

 FRODO           What's that smell?

 GOLLUM                   (lying)
             Orcses filth! Orcses come in here
             sometimes.

They continue on, deep into the DARK TUNNEL . . . FRODO is
feeling his way in the dark, following the SOUND ,of GOLLUM'S

FRODO slips as he tries to follow the voice . . . He puts his
HAND to the WALL to STEADY HIMSELF but quickly YANKS it away
... STRANDS of a WHITE THREAD stuck to his HAND.

 FRODO              It's sticky . . . What is it?

GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen ... only his voice echoes back
down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.

 GOLLUM O.S.              You will see . . . Oh, yes . . . You will see.

FRODO FREEZES! 
 FRODO                   (nervous)

FRODO begins to run in BLIND PANIC ...

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - DAY 
SAM stumbles blindly down the ANCIENT STAIRS, reckless and
uncaring, his face pale and devastated.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S FOOT slips . . .

... SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM
is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL.

ANGLE ON: SAM thudding into a LARGE ROCK, which saves him.
from tumbling headlong over the PRECIPICE.

 CUT TO: 
INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY 
FRODO is running BLINDLY . . . He falls, trapped in the sticky
substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground,
unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .

 GALADRIEL V/0            I give you the light of Earendil - our most
           beloved star. May it be a light for you in
           dark places when all other lights go out.

CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him
. . . he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL -
he holds it aloft.

 FRODO                 (stronger)
           Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

The PHIAL flickers ... kindles into a SILVER FLAME - a BRIGHT

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

ANGLE ON: FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead . . .

. . . just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB!

            Naughty little fly,
            Why does it cry?

BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They
whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free.

ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -
SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches . . .

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING
slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .

FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees
himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the
SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE . . .

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY 
ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles out of SHELOB'S LAIR . . . Tumbling
onto COLD ROCK.

 GOLLUM            Got away did it, Precious? Not this time,

FRODO pins GOLLUM on the ground, hands around his throat.

 SMEAGOL                  (pleading)
             It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol
             wouldn't hurt Master.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT. 
                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back . . . COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his
FEET.

             I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT 
FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep
stairs of CIRITH UNGOL . . . He is full of REMORSE at his
TREATMENT of SAM ...

GALADRIEL leans down towards FRODO, OFFERING her hand ... for
a beat, FRODO stares at her ... torn, not wanting to go on,
wanting to lie down . . . But he knows what he must do.

           slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall
           burn - like the heathen kings of old!

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed

SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the
devastation ... his eyes full of SADNESS ... they suddenly
fix on something.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN running through the RUIN of the BATTLE . . .
towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground ...

 PIPPIN              Merry ...?

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN ... HORROR and SHOCK erasing
all other memories from MERRY'S mind ... tears fall down
PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND . . .

                         PIPPIN (cont'd)
             Merry . . . it's me, it's Pippin . . .

 MERRY                   (groggy)

                  (disorientated)
             Are you going to leave me?

 PIPPIN              No Merry, I'm going to look after you.

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

 SHAGRAT              Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.

 GORBAG              It's going to the Great Eye, along with
             everything else . . .

ANGLE ON . . . FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

... The RING HAS GONE!

 SHAGRAT              I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
             rats!

GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST ...

 GORBAG                   (angry yell)
             You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in

on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE ... YELLING:

 SAM                 (yelling . . . 1st URUK-HAI)             ·

           I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

 SAM            Not if I stick you first!

GORBAG falls dead!

 FRODO                 (joyous disbelief)

           Oh, Sam . . . I'm so sorry . . . sorry for
           everything.

SAM quickly cuts FRODO free.

 SAM            Come on.

 FRODO                 (despairing)
           It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken
           it. Sam - they took the Ring!!

 SAM                   (quietly)
             Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket ...

                         SAM (cont'd)
             I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it -
             only for safe-keeping.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM amazed . . . his eyes drop to the
RN ... IG 
 FRODO              Give it to me.

SAM hesitates . . . . TENSION instantly builds between them.

                        FRODO (cont'd)
             Give me the Ring, Sam.

SAM seems strangely reluctant . . . ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of

             You must understand . . . The Ring is my
             burden . . . it will destroy you, Sam.

FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes ...

SAM looks down at FRODO ... his plain HOBBIT face full of
compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

 SAM            Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

 SAM            We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

 FRODO            There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR
. . . A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN ...

                      FRODO (cont'd)
               (terror)
           It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

 SAM              We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

 GANDALF              Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

 ARAGORN              If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

 GANDALF           It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

 GIMLI           Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

 GANDALF           Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

                  (to himself)
             I have sent him to his death.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

 ARAGORN              No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

 GANDALF              How?

 ARAGORN              Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

 EOMER              We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

 ARAGORN              Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

 LEGOLAS              A diversion . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN . . .

 GANDALF                   (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES.

 FRODO              There'll be none left for the return

 SAM                  (softly)

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across

COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES
for the WAGON . . . all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES.

 FRODO V/0            Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
           end - that each of us must come and go in
           the telling. His part in this tale was now
           over. There would be no more journeys for
           Bilbo. Save one.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF arrives in his CART . . .

 DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WEST FARTHING - DAY 
WIDE ON: The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY
PONY. 
 BILBO O.S.                 (frail)
           Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

 FRODO O.S.            To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on
           the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

INT. WAGON - DAY 
CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON . . . his ARM around
his UNCLE BILBO.

BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING . . . his head
slumped.

CONTINUED: 

BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN . . . with effort he raises his head


 BILBO                   (frail)
             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?

 FRODO                   (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.

 BILBO                   (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                   ·

BILBO nods back to sleep ... FRODO rests his head against
him.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE GREY HAVENS - DUSK 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, walking arm-in-arm with BILBO through a
beautiful ELVEN BOAT-HOUSE ... GANDALF follows with MERRY,
PIPPIN and SAM.

CLOSE ON: As BILBO looks up, he is STUNG by the BEAUTY before
hm . . .
 i

 BILBO              Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
             before.

TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY . . .

. . . to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE
STONE DOCK. 
ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for
them.

The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA ... visible
between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.

CONTINUED: 

The lighting is beautiful . . . S U N streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the
DOCK. 
BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and
GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

 GALADRIEL              The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
             time has come for the Dominion of Men.

 ELROND                   (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

 BILBO              I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

 GANDALF              Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CONTINUED: (2) 

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

 SAM                 (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

 FRODO                 (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

 SAM                 (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

 FRODO            The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING 
ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

 SAM             Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

 FRODO V/0             My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

 SAM             Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

 FADE TO BLACK.                                    Final Revision - October, 2003 151.

                           [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         You cannot pass!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] 
                         YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     BOROMIR
                         No! No!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     SAM
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     FRODO
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we dont want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place were trying to get to. 
                         Its just where we cant get. Lets 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     FRODO
                         He didnt mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Its getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         What food have we got left?

                                     SAM
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]

                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Exasperated] Its because weve been 
                         here before! Were going in circles.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         Were not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of Gollums arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollums cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sams neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen 
                         it before, havent you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or Ill cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors 
                         going to hear this racket! Lets just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         Its no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO
                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now 
                         that I see him, I do pity him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Begging] We be nice to them if they 
                         be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears 
                         to do what you wants. We swears.
 
                                     FRODO
                         Theres no promise you can make that 
                         I can trust.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We swears to serve the master of the 
                         preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.

                                     FRODO
                         The Ring is treacherous. It will hold 
                         you to your word.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, 
                         frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] 
                         Get down! I said, down!
 
                         [Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum 
                         tries to get away from him. He crashes 
                         onto the ground, choking.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sam!

                         Hes trying to trick us! We let him 
                         go hell throttle us in our sleep!
 
                         
                         [Gollum lies panting and holding his 
                         throat. He backs away, frightened, as 
                         Frodo approaches him.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You know the way to Mordor?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [nods warily] Yes...

                                     FRODO
                         Youve been there before?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [nods again] Yes...

                         [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope 
                         noose off Gollums neck. Gollum seems 
                         surprised and relieved.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You will lead us to the Black Gate.
 
                         
                         [Gollum scrambles off in the direction 
                         of Morannon and the hobbits follow in 
                         his wake.]
 


                         [A band of Uruk-hai marches across the 
                         plain, with two hobbits bound to the 
                         backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries 
                         to call to Merry, who is unconscious 
                         with a gash on his right brow.]

                         [Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand 
                         and signals a stop.]

                         struggles to reach his Elven brooch 
                         with his teeth. He then tears it off 
                         his cloak and drops it onto the ground. 
                         A foot stomps onto the brooch but it 
                         remains unbroken and visible on the 
                         grass.]

                         and ear pressed to the ground, listening 
                         for the sound of footsteps.]

                         up.] They must have caught our scent. 
                         Hurry! [He runs off.]

                         and then runs after Aragorn]

                         what bare rock can tell. [Runs after 
                         his companions.]

                         time to time, Legolas looks back to 
                         make sure that Gimli is keeping up. 
                         Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick

                         of industry. The forests will fall.

                         he turns his head, he spots a pair of 
                         gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the 
                         tree hes clinging to. The tree starts 
                         to move and groan.]

                         grabs at the air futilely as he falls.

                         the ground.]

                         [Suddenly he senses something behind 
                         him and as he looks up, the tree stomps 
                         and squashes him onto the forest floor.]

                         burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse

                         the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go 
                         quickly.

                         know it. They go round for miles and 
                         miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick 
                         as shadows we must be.

                         hobbits and Gollum appear as little 
                         specks. As the three pick their way 
                         gingerly though the marshes, they see 
                         faces floating in the water, still, 
                         rotting and pale, and flickering flames 
                         on the swamps.]

                         in Elven armour. He stares at it intently, 
                         until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo 
                         falls face-down into the water.]

                         faces of the dead, no longer still but 
                         screaming and grasping, their rotten 
                         robes and hair flowing about their gruesome 
                         faces. Their hands are reaching for 
                         him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. 
                         Frodo sputters and gasps for air as 
                         Gollum pulls him out of the water.]

                         bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening

                         troop to investigate. Frodo reaches 
                         Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the 
                         Easterlings move closer and closer, 
                         Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself 
                         and Sam. The soldiers are now directly 
                         in front of Sam, but their eyes see 
                         nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer 
                         from underneath the cloak. The soldiers 
                         soon leave and after a moment, Frodo 
                         throws back the cloak and pulls Sam 
                         out.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these 
                         Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
 
                         
                         [They prepare to make a run for the 
                         Gate.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Now!

                         [Gollum pulls them back.]

                                     GOLLUM
                         No! No, no master! They catch you! They 
                         catch you! Dont take it to him! He 
                         wants the preciousss. Always hes looking 
                         for it! And the preciousss is wanting 
                         to go back to him. But we mustnt let 
                         him have it.
 
                         [Frodo tries to make a run for it.]

                         No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] Theres 
                         another way. More secret. A dark way.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Why havent you spoken of this before?!
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Because Master did not ask!

                                     SAM
                         Hes up to something.

                                     FRODO
                         Are you saying theres another way into 
                         Mordor?
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, 
                         and then a tunnel.
                          [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate 
                         closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm 
                         and burying his face in his cloak.]

                         Hes led us this far, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo, no.

                                     FRODO
                         Hes been true to his word.

                                     SAM
                         [Whispers] No!

                                     FRODO
                         Lead the way, Sméagol.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Good Sméagol always helps.

                         [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares 
                         after him in disbelief.]
 
                         [On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes 
                         into view.]

                         Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
                         There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, 
                         whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans 
                         hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
 
                         
                         [In the Hall, Éowyn is kneeling before

                         My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? 
                         Uncle?
 
                         [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?

                         Be careful what you say. Do not look 
                         for welcome here.
 
                         [They ride on towards Edoras.]



                         [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. Gríma appears at the door.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         Oh, he he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on Éowyns shoulder.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.

                         to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.
 
                         [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves 
                         down to her throat.]

                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.
 
                         [Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other 
                         intently.]

                         Your words are poison!

                         [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, 
                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]

                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order 
                         of Gríma Wormtongue.
 
                         [Gandalf nods in understanding and signals 
                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking 
                         stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]

                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas 
                         arm.]

                         The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
                         lessened of late, Théoden King.

                         the hall and its hostile occupants. 
                         A group of men starts to follow their

                         A just question, my liege. [He walks 
                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in 
                         which this conjurer chooses to appear.

                         [Éowyn opens a chest in which lies a 
                         sword. She unsheathes it and begins 
                         to practice. She swings around and is 
                         met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.]

                         Women of this country learned long ago: 
                         Those without swords may still die upon 
                         them. I fear neither death nor pain.

                         vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect 
                         an attack on the city. They will flee 
                         to Helms Deep, the great fortress of 
                         Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take 
                         through the mountains. They will be 
                         slow. They will have women and children

                         to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to

                         a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt

                         and appearance, haha that theyre often 
                         mistaken for Dwarf men.

                         with all that is left of her kin.

                         and charges at them. The warg attacks 
                         Háma and kills him.]

                         Legolas runs over and kills the warg 
                         with an arrow. He then draws his knife 
                         and kills the Orc.]

                         help. Legolas gazes into the distance 
                         and sees many warg-riders coming fast 
                         towards them, kicking up dust trails 
                         as they go.]

                         No! You must do this... for me.

                         I mean, charge forward! March forward! 
                         [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather 
                         unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!

                         [She looks back at the Rohirrim and 
                         sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each 
                         others gaze for a moment before Aragorn 
                         turns to join Théoden. Éowyn departs 
                         with the villagers in the opposite direction.]
 
                         
                         [Legolas takes aim at the distant target 
                         and fells a warg rider. He draws another 
                         arrow and kills another. Just as he 
                         reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden 
                         and company approaching. He quickly 
                         runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap 
                         and joins in the fray with Gimli behind 
                         him on horseback.]

                         head on and the battle begins. Théoden 
                         and company hack away at the warg riders. 
                         In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls 
                         off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling 
                         at him.]

                         kills it with one shot.]

                         Argh! That one counts as mine!
 
                         [As Gimli swings his axe at another 
                         warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, 
                         pinning him under.]

                         Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!

                         [As he tries to lift the warg off him, 
                         an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills 
                         him quickly, twisting his neck, and 
                         it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at 
                         the Orc and makes a face. He tries to 
                         lift both the warg and Orc off him. 
                         Just then, another warg comes upon him 
                         and bares its teeth, ready to strike.

                         on horseback and throws it at the warg. 
                         It dies, landing on Gimli and adding 
                         to the pile on top of him.]

                         [Théoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn 
                         is knocked off Hasufel and attacked 
                         by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the 
                         warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt 
                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn 
                         tries to let go of the warg but finds 
                         his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. 
                         He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle 
                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed. 
                         The warg runs right off the cliff and 
                         they both disappear over the edge. The 
                         battle is winding down as the Rohirrim 
                         finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]

                         a little tumble off the cliff.

                         Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs 
                         to the edge of the cliff and looks down 
                         to see the great drop and rushing waters 
                         below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli 
                         comes to stand beside him.]

                         Draw all our forces behind the wall. 
                         Bar the gate, and set a watch on the 
                         surround.

                         What of those who cannot fight, my lord? 
                         The women and children?

                         Get them into the caves. [Walks down 
                         the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's 
                         arm would have grown long indeed if 
                         he thinks he can reach us here.

                                     GRÍMA (V.O.)
                         Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
                         wall is solid rock but for a small culvert 
                         at its base which is little more than 
                         a drain.
 
                         [Camera turns to Gríma and Saruman at 
                         Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark 
                         dry substances into a vessel. Gríma 
                         is holding a lit candle in his hand.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         How? How can fire undo stone? What kind 
                         of device could bring down the wall?
 
                         
                         [As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman 
                         takes hold of Grímas hand and pushes 
                         the candle away from the vessel firmly.]
 
                         
                                     SARUMAN
                         If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep 
                         will fall.
 
                         [He walks away towards the balcony.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, 
                         it would take a number beyond reckoning, 
                         thousands to storm the keep.
 
                                     SARUMAN
                         Tens of thousands.

                                     GRÍMA
                         But, my lord, there is no such force.
 
                         
                         [Both of them came onto the balcony 
                         of the tower. Gríma suddenly sees and 
                         hears the enormous armies laid out below 
                         in neat rows and is astounded and awed. 
                         He continues to hold the extinguished 
                         candle aloft as he gapes at the vast 
                         army below. A horn is sounded, announcing 
                         the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer 
                         is heard from the army. Saruman raises 
                         a hand.]
 
                                     SARUMAN
                         A new power is rising. Its victory is 
                         at hand!
 
                         [The army cheers and roars.]

                                     SARUMAN
                         This night, the land will be stained 
                         with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms 
                         Deep! Leave none alive!
 
                         [The camera keeps zooming out from the 
                         balcony over the incredible size of 
                         Sarumans army, past Uruk-hai, spears, 
                         and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The 
                         camera focuses back on Saruman who then 
                         raises his hands in the air]

                         [A tear flows down Grímas cheek. The 
                         Uruk-hai army began their march to Helms 
                         Deep.]

                         There is always smoke rising from Isengard 
                         these days.

                         There was a time when Saruman would 
                         walk in my woods. But now he has a mind 
                         of metal and wheels. He no longer cares 
                         for growing things.

                         Its Sarumans army! The war has started.
 
                         


                         [Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious.

                         If Aragorn survives this war, you will 
                         still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, 
                         and Aragorn made king and all that you 
                         hope for comes true, you will still 
                         have to taste the bitterness of mortality. 
                         Whether by the sword or the slow decay 
                         of time, Aragorn will die.

                         It is close now, so close to achieving 
                         its goal.

                         life on this Earth, even unto the ending 
                         of the world. The time of the Elves

                         Our scouts report Saruman has attacked 
                         Rohan. Théodens people have fled to 
                         Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But 
                         we must look to our own borders. Faramir, 
                         Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling 
                         an army. Easterlings and Southrons are 
                         passing through the Black Gate.

                         Some thousands. More come every day.

                         We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but 
                         if the city is attacked, we wont hold 
                         it.

                         from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The 
                         fight will come to men on both fronts. 
                         Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us 
                         soon. And he will strike hard. He knows 
                         now we do not have the strength to repel 
                         him.

                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.

                         companions. One we lost in Mória. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.

                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.
 


                         [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought.

                         the third one.

                         penalty of death. [He gestures to archers 
                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for

                         from the pool onto a rock. He holds 
                         a fish in his hand and starts singing, 
                         slapping the fish on the rock as he 
                         goes.]

                         [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch 
                         a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The 
                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp 
                         and he whacks it some more.]
 
                         [Faramir has his hand raised to order 
                         his men to shoot. At the last moment, 
                         Frodo calls out.]

                         is bound to me. And I to him. He is 
                         our guide. Please, let me go down to 
                         him.
 
                         [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the 
                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum 
                         who is gorging on the raw fish.]

                         follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks 
                         up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]

                         [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] 
                         Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth 
                         and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
 


                         [Back in their holding area, Sam and 
                         Frodo are alone.]
 
                                     SAM
                         We have to get out of here. You go. 
                         Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, 
                         Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. 
                         Disappear.
 
                                     FRODO
                         I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried 
                         to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings 
                         taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell 
                         find me. Hell see.
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo...

                         [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is 
                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you 
                         understand? Hes got to destroy it. 
                         Thats where were going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Osgiliath is under attack. They call 
                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. Its such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                                     FARAMIR
                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards Helms Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]

                         my friend)
 
                         [He rides into Helms Deep to the amazement 
                         of all.]

                         [Pushing his way through the crowd.] 
                         Where is he? Where is he? Get out of 
                         the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!

                         Gimli, where is the king?

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         Le ab-dollen. (Youre late.) [They smile. 
                         Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]

                         fill her eyes.]

                                     ARAGORN
                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Ten thousand?!

                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.

                         Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
 
                         
                         [Along the passage behind the Deeping 
                         Wall.]

                         lad able to bear arms to be ready for 
                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden 
                         stands at the gate of Helms Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.

                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on Gimlis shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and Théoden back in.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. Sarumans hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, weve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         They do not come to destroy Rohans 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.

                         [Draws close to Aragorn] What would 
                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We 
                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gondor will answer.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was Gon 
                          No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.

                         hear movement from the forest around

                         weapons are being distributed. Aragorn 
                         picks up a battered sword, looks at 
                         it and tosses it back.]

                         Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. 
                         I can see it in their eyes. [The men 
                         around them fell silent. Legolas speaks 
                         to Aragorn.] Boe a hûn: neled herain

                         and then walks away. Legolas makes as

                         An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed 
                         boy. Another stares at the axe that 
                         he is handed with frightened eyes. Another 
                         child wearing oversized chain mail takes 
                         up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside 
                         the main hall of the keep, his back 
                         to the entrance where a bright white 
                         light is streaming through.]

                         and the rider? Where is the horn that 
                         was blowing? They have passed like rain 
                         on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.

                         on the steps. He sees a young lad in 
                         armour holding a sword looking around 
                         nervously.]

                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]

                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         Háma.
 
                         [He hands the sword back to Haleth and 
                         leans close to him, putting a hand on 
                         his shoulder.]

                         There is always hope.



                         [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his 
                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.

                         Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing 
                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]

                         lands with its length right to the floor.] 
                         Its a little tight across the chest.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles. 
                         Just then, a horn sounds in the background]

                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]

                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.

                         sounds of a marching army move closer 
                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children

                         continues to march at the fortress,

                         can we do in the end? We've got the 
                         Shire. Maybe we should go home.

                          THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.]

                         With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai 
                         and looks down as his wound in seeming 
                         disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from 
                         behind him unnoticed and slices him 
                         on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he 
                         looks around him and sees his kin fallen 
                         among dead Uruk-hai.]

                         rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. 
                         Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then 
                         with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and 
                         swings down to the ground, killing as

                         at his throat, his eyes livid with madness 
                         and anger that someone would try to 
                         take the Ring away.]
 
                                     FRODO

                         [With tears running down his face] Its 
                         me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your 
                         Sam?
 
                         [The madness fades and recognition returns 
                         to Frodos eyes. He realises what he 
                         nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling 
                         backwards, he collapses against a wall 
                         and Sting falls to the ground with a 
                         clang. Sam gets up slowly.]

                         [Slowly and with despair] I cant do 
                         this, Sam.

                         [Getting up slowly] I know. Its all 
                         wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be 
                         here. But we are. [He stands and leans 
                         against a wall, looking out into the

                         Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
                         Full of darkness and danger they were. 
                         And sometimes you didnt want to know 
                         the end. Because how could the end be 
                         happy? [Images of the riders winning

                         thing, this shadow. [The women and children

                         must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard

                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didnt. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.

                         public hero

                         city of Baskul, where Robert Conway 
                         has been sent to evacuate ninety white 
                         people before they are butchered in 
                         a local revolution.

                         The field is aflare with floodlights 
                         - on one side is an office building 
                         - on the other are hangars. The whole 
                         field is filled with Chinese refugees 
                         running around wildly. An Army transport 
                         is in front of the office building, 
                         motors going.

                         Showing in the distance, probably several 
                         miles away, the effect of a burning 
                         city, which is Baskul. Over the shot 
                         we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. 
                         In the f.g., we see the silhouetted 
                         figures of Chinese running away from 
                         Baskul and toward the Camera, their 
                         personal packs on their backs.

                         Toward office building. Conway comes 
                         out of the building, followed by a small 
                         group of white people with frightened 
                         faces. They have to fight their way 
                         through a horde of milling Chinese.

                         As Conway and group finally reach the 
                         plane where Conway forces the white 
                         people in. In this he is aided by his 
                         brother, George, a young and vigorous 
                         Englishman. The pilot sticks his head 
                         out of the cockpit.

                         PILOT
                                     
                         Conway, we can't take more than seven!
 
                                                              
                         Conway pulls a passenger out and gives 
                         the pilot a signal to start.

                         All right. I'm sorry. There will be 
                         another plane in a minute. All right 
                         - go on.

                         Motors roar, and the plane starts to 
                         move, scattering those of the Chinese 
                         who were unfortunately too close to 
                         the ship. Conway and George rush back 
                         into the office building.

                         men, women and several children. They 
                         all lift their panicky faces to Conway 
                         and George as they enter. A barrage 
                         of questions are flung at them.

                         It is filled with Chinese refugees clinging

                         in Chinese, ordering them out. Some 
                         hesitate, and they have to push the

                         When they have all left, Conway opens

                         waits for the fuel to spill on the ground,

                         one of them manages to get his foot 
                         on the step, and Conway pushes him violently.

                         Who staggers back and falls, sprawling. 
                         As he hits the ground, he yells:
                                      
                         MAN

                         Conway looks his surprise and lifts 
                         him off the ground.

                         Glaring off toward Conway, picks up 
                         a board and starts toward Conway.

                         George emerges in time to see the Chinese 
                         lift the board and about to clout Conway 
                         on the head. George moves quickly, puts 
                         out his left hand, wards off the blow 
                         and with his right he punches the Chinese, 
                         who reels out of the scene.

                         A shadowy figure materializes in the 
                         cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. 
                         He shoves Fenner aside and takes his 
                         place.

                         Conway pushes George up and starts to 
                         mount himself. He looks off - and what 
                         he sees startles him.

                         Of what Conway sees. Several trucks 
                         loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms 
                         - come tearing up the road - come to 
                         a stop. Some fire toward plane - others 
                         are setting up machine guns. Droves 
                         of refugees scramble to cover.

                         Already present are Barnard, an American; 
                         Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, 
                         whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway 
                         slams the door shut - looks off - then 
                         cries:

                         Get down on the floor, everybody. Go 
                         ahead, Fenner!
                                      
                         They all fall on their faces.

                         Of the new pilot setting the controls 
                         and lifting the plane into flight.

                         As the plane swings around - taxies 
                         crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied 
                         by gunfire of the bandits.

                         The occupants are still on the floor. 
                         Conway rises and glances out of a window, 
                         warily.

                         There are murmurs of "Yes" - "I'm all

                         Lovett produces a small box clutched 
                         under his arm.

                         I have here a discovery that will startle 
                         the world. It's the vertebrae from the 
                         lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in 
                         Asia.

                         When I get home I shall probably be 
                         knighted for it.

                         Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind 
                         if I take a look at it?

                         Not at all.
                                     
                         He lifts the lid and Barnard peeks inside.

                         Wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton 
                         is something that resembles a dry chicken 
                         bone.

                         Barnard reaches for the box, but Lovett 
                         pulls it away from him.

                         This is the only thing I was able to 
                         save when those heathens surrounded 
                         me.

                         (he is allowed to take it out and examine 
                         it - unimpressed)

                         You see, from this vertebrae I shall 
                         be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.

                         Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted 
                         for finding that soupbone?

                         It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium

                         Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and 
                         he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
 
                                                              
                         Barnard stares at Lovett unbelievingly.

                         Lovett glares at him resentfully, and 
                         snaps the lid shut on his box.

                         Gloria sits slumped in her seat, looking 
                         glumly out. Barnard glances at her curiously. 
                         Finally he makes a friendly overture.

                         Gloria turns her head, surveys Barnard

                         back.

                         All is silent for a moment. Conway is 
                         writing on a small pad - which he rests 
                         on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging 
                         through a closet - rear of the cabin.

                         Conway still writes, undisturbed. George 
                         reaches into the closet and emerges 
                         with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights 
                         up.

                         He crosses to Conway.

                         Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent

                         cables now. I want you to drink with 
                         me.
                                      
                         (holds his cup up)
                                     
                         Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway 
                         - England's new Foreign Secretary.
 
                                                              
                         Conway watches him, amused. George gulps 
                         down his drink.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (after a slight hesitation - downing 
                         his drink)
                                      
                         Hurray!
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!

                         People are going to point to me and 
                         say, "There goes George Conway - brother 
                         of the Foreign Secretary."
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
 
                                                              
                         Conway takes the bottle from him and 
                         pours himself a second drink.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         That's why they're sending for you, 
                         Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, 
                         it was bound to happen. They need you.
 
                                                              
                         Conway, with a poured drink in hand, 
                         laughs.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         All right, you can laugh if you want 
                         to. But who else can they get? Who else 
                         is there in all of England half the 
                         fighter, half the diplomat, who

                         has half your knowledge of the foreign 
                         situation? They can't stop you now, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         Conway moodily pours himself a third. 
                         He downs the drink as we
                                      
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY
                                     
                         We find Conway, asleep in his seat, 
                         his head on his hands. George approaches 
                         and tenderly spreads a jacket over his 
                         shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.

                         (drunkenly)
                                     
                         Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report 
                         out yet?
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Did you say we saved ninety white people?
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Hurray for us. Did you say that we left 
                         ten thousand natives down there to be 
                         annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. 
                         They don't count.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better try to get some sleep, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. 
                         Can't you just see me, Freshie, with 
                         all those other shrewd, little Foreign 
                         Secretaries?
                                      
                         (confidentially - screws up face)
                                     
                         You see, the trick is to see who can 
                         out-talk the other. Everybody wants 
                         something for nothing, and if you can't 
                         get it with smooth talk, you send an 
                         army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. 
                         I'm not going to have an army. I'm going 
                         to disband mine. I'm going to sink my 
                         battleships - I'm going to destroy every 
                         piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy 
                         approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen 
                         - what can we do for you?" So then the 
                         poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. 
                         And what will they think, Freshie? They'll 
                         think to themselves - "Something's wrong 
                         here. We've been duped. This is not 
                         according to form. These people seem 
                         to be quite friendly, and why should 
                         we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down 
                         their arms. You see how simple the whole 
                         thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked 
                         right in the pants
                                      
                         (pause - drily)
                                     
                         and I'll be slapped straight into the 
                         nearest insane asylum.
                                      
                         He starts to pour himself another drink.
 
                                                              
                         ? 483 ?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better not drink any more, Bob. 
                         You're not talking sense.
                                      
                         Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles 
                         cynically.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't worry, George. Nothing's going 
                         to happen. I'll fall right into line. 
                         I'll be the good little boy that everybody 
                         wants me to be. I'll be the best little 
                         Foreign Secretary we ever had, just 
                         because I haven't the nerve to be anything 
                         else.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Do try to sleep, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, 
                         sleep.
                                      
                         He grunts and squirms. George tucks 
                         him in.

                         George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful.
 
                                                              
                         He gets settled. George relaxes and, 
                         leaning back, shuts his eyes.

                         It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA

                         the glass panel leading to the cockpit. 
                         The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner 
                         we see a strange, Mongolian face - with 
                         sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays 
                         across his mouth.

                         sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes, 
                         a mere speck, over the horizon.

                         The morning sun peeks over a mountain 
                         top. From the same direction, as if 
                         arriving with the sun, the ship looms 
                         up, and comes roaring toward us.

                         All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets 
                         on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens 
                         his eyes - and stretches. As he does 
                         so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

                         Good morning

                         Look here, young man.

                         I didn't care for 'sister' last night, 
                         and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. 
                         My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.

                         I see.

                         I see.

                         Well, it's a good morning, anyway.

                         I'm never conversational before I coffee.
 
                                                              
                         Barnard glances out of the window, looks 
                         around outside thoughtfully.

                         Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? 
                         Say, we're supposed to be travelling 
                         east, aren't we?
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         Why, of course. Yes.

                         Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling 
                         west.

                         That's ridiculous.

                         Is it?

                         It certainly is.

                         Any child knows how to tell direction. 
                         Any child. I don't care where the child 
                         is - in the air, on the earth, or in 
                         the sea. If you face the rising sun, 
                         your right hand is the north, and your 
                         left hand is the south

                         I always get it twisted because I'm 
                         left-handed.

                         Well, you just reverse it. Your left 
                         hand is

                         What difference does it make what 'hand' 
                         you are? The north is the north!

                         Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises 
                         in the east, and we're going away from 
                         it.

                         As he sulks by himself, looks around 
                         - locates the sun in back of him - smiles 
                         - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending 
                         glance over at Barnard - then suddenly 
                         his face clouds - the whole thing dawns 
                         on him.

                         Couldn't you arrange to make a little

                         I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai 
                         is east of here!

                         Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in

                         It's Fenner.

                         Of course. That's what I told them last 
                         night. You can't expect a man to sail 
                         around in the dark.[5]
                                      
                         During this George has been looking 
                         around - he rises.

                         All right, all right. Calm yourself. 
                         I'll talk to Fenner.

                         He crosses to panel leading to cockpit, 
                         CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there 
                         he knocks on the window.

                         George knocks again. From the cockpit 
                         side - the small shade suddenly snaps 
                         up - and George finds himself staring 
                         into the face of the mysterious pilot. 
                         He takes an instinctive step backward. 
                         The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE 
                         WIDENS as George keeps backing up until 
                         he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway 
                         and shakes his shoulder.

                         Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens 
                         his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout 
                         it, George speaks.

                         Conway looks at him, glances off toward 
                         the others, and back at George.

                         We're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going 
                         in the opposite direction.
                                      
                         This interests Conway and he looks out 
                         of the window.

                         Then rising, he crosses to cockpit. 
                         The others watch him expectantly.

                         Conway pounds on the panel. The face 
                         of the pilot appears in sight. Conway 
                         tries to ask him something in Chinese. 
                         The pilot glares at them for a second, 
                         then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively 
                         they back away.

                         large open space at the foot of the 
                         hills. The plane is headed for it.

                         scantily attired, but bearing bayonets, 
                         running toward the plane.

                         looks off and is startled by something 
                         he sees. George follows his gaze, and 
                         a bewildered expression comes into his 
                         eyes, too.

                         Shooting through door. The strange-looking 
                         natives have surrounded the plane and 
                         are closing in.

                         Conway and George both instinctively 
                         wheel around toward the opposite side. 
                         But from that direction too, a horde 
                         of natives dash toward them. Conway 
                         hesitates a second, and like a flash 
                         springs for the door. But he stops again, 
                         as he opens the door.

                         himself staring into the threatening 
                         mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly 
                         shuts the door.

                         Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted,

                         open, his eyes popping. George, his 
                         teeth clenched, struggles against a 
                         desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly.

                         finally unable to control himself, emits 
                         a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his

                         Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer

                         up in torturous pain. For a moment nothing 
                         is heard but her stifled moans.

                         in despair. All of a sudden there is 
                         a loud, sputtering noise from the outside. 
                         They all react - listen for a moment 
                         - until the noise dies completely. Now 
                         nothing is heard - not even the motor.

                         The occupants brace themselves for the 
                         jolt. The ship hits and bounces several 
                         times and finally stops. Its nose seems 
                         to bury itself in the ground. The people 
                         are lifted high into the air where they 
                         remain, suspended for a few seconds, 
                         terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by 
                         grinding, crackling sounds, the ship 
                         flops back and falls on its side. For 
                         a moment there is stark silence - while 
                         the people do not stir. A look of relief 
                         spreads over their faces.

                         The passengers offer dazed replies: 
                         "Okay - yeah - I think so." Meanwhile, 
                         Conway has opened the door. A swirling 
                         mass of snow greets them, so that they 
                         have to force their way out.

                         from the plane in the blinding snow. 
                         George quickly runs around to the other 
                         side. Conway crosses to the cockpit, 
                         and clambers aboard.

                         of the pilot's body gives him pause. 
                         He lifts up his chin, stares into his 
                         face - pulls up his eyelid and then 
                         places a hand over his heart. He turns

                         It must have happened the moment he 
                         hit the ground.
                                      
                         (a pause)
                                     
                         Let's take a look at this map.
                                     
                         Conway holds the map under the dashboard 
                         light. He studies it painstakingly, 
                         and his tense expression changes to 
                         one of deep concern. George's eyes are 
                         glued on him.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What is it?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         See that spot?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         That's where we were this morning. He 
                         had it marked. Right on the border of 
                         Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. 
                         We must be a thousand miles beyond it 
                         - just a blank on the map.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (afraid to ask)
                                     
                         What's it mean?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It means we're in unexplored country 
                         - country nobody ever reached.
                                      
                         George stares at him, wide-eyed, the 
                         gravity of their situation slowly penetrating 
                         his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts 
                         are interrupted by a knock on the panel, 
                         and he looks up.

                         We see the faces of Barnard and the 
                         others. We hear their voices inquiring 
                         - "Hey, Conway, what's happening?" - 
                         "What's up?" - "Where are we?" - "What'd 
                         you find out?"

                         Conway turns to George.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         George, our chances of getting out of 
                         this are pretty slim. But it's up to 
                         us.

                         He enters the cabin through the cockpit.

                         As Conway enters, he is met by a volley 
                         of questions.

                         Everything's all right. The pilot won't 
                         trouble us any more. He's - he's dead.
 
                                                              
                         This is met by a series of exclamations.

                         Well, there's nothing we can do until 
                         the morning.

                         Taking in George as he enters from cockpit. 
                         His terror-stricken eyes look dully 
                         before him. He stops in the doorway.

                         The storm will probably die down by 
                         then. My suggestion is that we better 
                         all try and get a good night's rest.

                         and Lovett as they face Conway, who 
                         sits down.

                         They all wheel around and face George.
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Why don't you tell them we're a million 
                         miles from civilization, without a chance 
                         of getting out of here alive? It's slow 
                         starvation - that's what it is. It's 
                         a slow, horrible death!
                                      
                         When the significance of this outburst 
                         finally sinks into the chaotic minds 
                         of his listeners, they turn to Conway 
                         hopefully, certain he will refute it. 
                         But Conway looks beyond them at George. 
                         From his noncommittal silence, they 
                         realize that George's statement is the 
                         truth. They slip into their seats. The 
                         place is heavy with a fatalistic silence. 
                         George slowly crosses to his seat near 
                         Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes. 
                         Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, 
                         bitter laughter from Gloria. They all 
                         look up.

                         Shooting toward the mountains which 
                         seem to imprison the valley below. The 
                         snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, 
                         seems to threaten the valley with complete 
                         obliteration.

                         It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA 
                         PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering 
                         in their blankets as they pace worriedly.

                         George and Conway are missing. Lovett 
                         turns from the window.
                                      
                         LOVETT

                         done. Heroes of the newspapers!

                         Lovett sees something through the window.

                         George and Conway are seen walking briskly 
                         toward the plane, their few clothes 
                         a scant protection against the biting 
                         wind.

                         The others quickly glance up, just as 
                         Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway 
                         has a serious mien, but George is full 
                         of vigor and enthusiasm.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Hello, everybody.
                                     
                         He holds out his hat which he has been 
                         carrying, bottom side up.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, we found some food.
                                     
                         Barnard and Lovett rush to him.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         No chance of our starving now.
                                     
                         When they see the contents of his hat, 
                         their faces fall.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         What is it?

                         Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, 
                         have some. I've read of people lasting 
                         thirty days on this stuff.
                                      
                         They grab handfuls. He goes on:
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Listen, my brother and I have worked 
                         out a plan. If we use our heads, we 
                         should be able to keep alive for weeks, 
                         until he gets back.

                         GEORGE
                                     
                         He doesn't know. But he's starting out 
                         right away in the direction of India. 
                         Sooner or later he's bound to run into 
                         somebody - a tribe or something.

                         Throughout the previous scene he has 
                         been busily occupied making preparations. 
                         Out of the baggage hold he has brought 
                         some blankets and rope and has been 
                         wrapping his feet in them. As George 
                         speaks, he looks up and smiles.

                         Now here's the idea. We found a cave 
                         over by that small hill. After we bury 
                         the pilot, we're moving in. We can have 
                         a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised 
                         to see Bob back within a week.
                                      
                         Conway's smile dies on his face. We 
                         get a feeling he is attempting a futile 
                         journey, and is fully aware of it. He 
                         resumes the roping of his feet - his 
                         movements mechanical.

                         appearing over the top of a hill, we 
                         see a caravan of natives approaching. 
                         They are not close enough to distinguish 
                         who or what they are, but that they 
                         are human beings is apparent.

                         Where George, Lovett and Barnard wait, 
                         a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins 
                         them. Gloria has stayed inside.

                         The approach of the caravan from the 
                         viewpoint of the group. It comprises 
                         some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins, 
                         fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the 
                         middle of the single file is Chang, 
                         an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward 
                         as their leader.

                         As Conway leaves his group and meets 
                         the oncoming party. He approaches Chang 
                         and bowing courteously, greets him in 
                         Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly 
                         and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

                         left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, 
                         but we suddenly found ourselves travelling 
                         in the opposite direction

                         He must have had a heart attack, or 
                         perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed 
                         he was dead.

                         Chang turns to some of his men and issues 
                         an order in a foreign tongue, obviously 
                         instructions to take care of the pilot.

                         journey. We see them first climbing 
                         - then across long vastnesses of flat 
                         land. Each succeeding time we see them, 
                         their feet drag more wearily. Their 
                         breathing becomes more difficult. These

                         is just starting around a hairpin curve. 
                         They are forced to travel on a narrow 
                         ledge overlooking a deep ravine.

                         to require a Herculean effort. She stops 
                         and has a fit of coughing.

                         the peak of the mountain they are ascending 
                         towers high above them. The cutting 
                         wind moans treacherously as it caroms 
                         off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops 
                         them.

                         come upon a narrow crevice which opens 
                         up into a passageway. One by one they 
                         step through, assisted by the natives. 
                         On the other side, they sigh relievedly. 
                         Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill 
                         has lessened. They look up to inspect

                         comes into their eyes.

                         From angle at mountain top.
                                     
                         A sight that is both magnificent and 
                         incredible. The eye-filling horizon 
                         before them throws out a softness and 
                         a warmth that is breathless. On the 
                         left is a group of colored pavilions 
                         that seem as if suspended on the mountainside. 
                         Down below, in the hazy distance, is 
                         a valley which gives one the impression 
                         of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending 
                         of soft colors. In every direction, 
                         wherever one might gaze, there is a 
                         feast of strange and heavenly beauty.

                         As Chang approaches Conway.

                         Conway's group and Chang. Chang smiles 
                         as he watches their astonished faces. 
                         Conway turns from the rare magnificence 
                         of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind 
                         and storm they had just encountered, 
                         and looks backward, in the direction 
                         from which they came to assure himself 
                         he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang, 
                         watching him, answers him before he 
                         can express his astonishment.
                                      
                         CHANG
                                     
                         (a wave of his hand)
                                     
                         You see, we are sheltered by mountains 
                         on every side. A strange phenomena for 
                         which we are very grateful.

                         and peaceful Shangri-La.

                         At the foot of a wide marble stairway 
                         as the caravan stops.

                         On the group, as they look around and 
                         feast their eyes on the grandeur of 
                         the place.

                         Following Conway's gaze. In an upper 
                         window of a tower, their faces glued 
                         to the pane, are two robed Lamas who 
                         stare down curiously. CAMERA PANS OVER 
                         to a very narrow terrace covered almost 
                         completely by a floral arbor. In it 
                         stands a statuesque woman of rare beauty. 
                         She looks down at Conway intently.

                         As he returns her gaze, impressed by 
                         her beauty.

                         His eyes still on the girl above. He 
                         starts up the steps, staring at her, 
                         then stumbles.

                         It suggests nothing we might expect 
                         to see in this forsaken place. The motif 
                         is neither Oriental nor religious - 
                         but rather a delicately appointed room, 
                         subdued in tones. At the moment, no 
                         one is present except servants who silently 
                         set the table.

                         Of Lovett peering worriedly toward dining 
                         room door. He sees two servants who 
                         flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly. 
                         Barnard emerges from a room across the 
                         hall, and Lovett beckons to him. Both 
                         are attired in flowing robes not unlike 
                         the one worn by Chang.

                         Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. 
                         I definitely do not like this place.

                         Look at me. Look at what they gave me 
                         to wear.

                         You never looked better in your life. 
                         As soon as our clothes are cleaned, 
                         they're going to give them back to us, 
                         Lovey.
                                      
                         They have reached the doorway of the 
                         dining room and halt. Two servants bow 
                         and scrape and lead them in.

                         to their places.

                         That's what they do with cattle just 
                         before the slaughter. Fatten them.

                         At this moment Conway and George enter.

                         He takes something off the table and 
                         nibbles at it.

                         Some layout they got here. Did you get 
                         a load of the rooms? You couldn't do 
                         better at the Ritz.

                         It is in semi-darkness. The moon sends 
                         a stream of light through the windows. 
                         Outside we see the outline of towering 
                         mountains. Spread across the bed - her 
                         clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria 
                         - her face sunk deep in the pillows.

                         Gloria emits wracking coughs. After 
                         a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks 
                         are wet - her hair disheveled - her 
                         eyes bloodshot. We get an impression 
                         of someone who has suffered for hours. 
                         Finally, her coughing begins again - 
                         and unable to stand it, she rises and 
                         paces the floor - then she crosses to 
                         the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER - and into her eyes has come 
                         a grim, determined expression.

                         She is staring at the chasm below her.

                         with that meal!

                         I'm glad you like it. It's made right 
                         here in the valley.

                         Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse 
                         us, we're very anxious to discuss ways 
                         and means of getting back home.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         The first thing we want to do is to 
                         cable the Foreign Office. All of England 
                         is waiting to hear about my brother. 
                         There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready 
                         to take him back.

                         Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm 
                         afraid I can't help. Unfortunately, 
                         we have no wireless here. As a matter 
                         of fact, we have no means of communication 
                         with the outside world.
                                      
                         George stares at him suspiciously - 
                         and then turns to Conway for his reaction 
                         - but Conway is apparently disinterested 
                         in the whole conversation.

                         It's always been a source of deep regret, 
                         but the mountains surrounding us have 
                         made reception almost impossible.

                         In that event, we better make arrangements 
                         to get some porters immediately. Some 
                         means to get us back to civilization.

                         Of course, the porters will be very 
                         well paid - that is, within reason.

                         too hazardous.

                         He has remained quiet throughout the

                         a paper in front of him, upon which 
                         he has been writing.

                         interest. It is a picture of Chang which

                         some five hundred miles from here. That 
                         is our only contact with the outside

                         make the journey.

                         choke in his throat.

                         there is a prolonged delay, Shangri-La 
                         will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant 
                         as possible.

                         And now if you will excuse me, it is 
                         getting late. I do hope you all sleep 
                         well. Good night.
                                      
                         The servants move his chair back. Before 
                         he goes, however, he turns to Conway.

                         Conway, a little surprised at the distinction 
                         in his behalf, nods.

                         Chang exits. There is a hushed silence 
                         following Chang's departure.

                         Conway, I don't like that man. He's 
                         too vague.

                         It seems to me we should be grateful. 
                         We were in a bad mess this morning.

                         After all, this is quite pleasant. Why 
                         not make ourselves comfortable until

                         While he was speaking, the muted strains 
                         of a violin float into the room. Conway

                         a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards 
                         in the other room.

                         Do you notice the resemblance between 
                         those natives and the pilot? And why 
                         did those clothes materialize so conveniently 
                         when they met us at the plane? Chang 
                         himself just said that they never venture 
                         beyond that point. What brought them 
                         there? Unless it was to meet us?

                         There must be some connection between 
                         the plane and this place. They must 
                         have deliberately brought us here. Why,

                         and somewhat more than moderately happy.

                         Why, we have no crime here. What makes 
                         a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, 
                         envy, the desire to possess something 
                         owned by another. There can be no crime 
                         where there is a sufficiency of everything.

                         not be considered good manners to take 
                         a woman that another man wanted.

                         that he didn't give a hang if it was 
                         good manners or not?

                         to let him have her.

                         how a little courtesy all around helps

                         Chang smiles. Conway scarcely hears 
                         the last speech, for his attention has 
                         been caught by the playing of a piano. 
                         He stops to listen. Chang has walked 
                         out of scene.

                         Conway locates the direction whence 
                         the music comes, goes to a doorway where 
                         he stops.

                         He realizes Conway did not follow him 
                         and turns. When he sees Conway, his 
                         face clouds - and he starts toward him.

                         Conway watches someone through door 
                         with grave interest. Chang enters scene

                         room, oddly shaped, and except for a 
                         piano, a harp and several chairs, is 
                         otherwise sparsely furnished. At the 
                         extreme end, the room is set off by 
                         an alcove of stained glass extending 
                         from the ceiling to the floor, where 
                         it finishes with a deep window seat. 
                         At the piano we see an old man - and 
                         by his side is the girl Conway saw last 
                         night. They finish playing and both 
                         laugh heartily.

                         - and smiles.

                         sees Conway, off scene, and her face 
                         sobers - self-consciously.

                         Conway turns for one last glimpse of 
                         the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking 
                         up at his face, puzzled and amused.

                         They have arrived in a small room, where 
                         they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl

                         the nut to Conway. Then he does the 
                         same for himself. During the following

                         there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence 
                         somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did 
                         it all start?

                         That, my dear Conway, is the story of 
                         a remarkable man.

                         A Belgian priest by the name of Father 
                         Perrault, the first European to find 
                         this place, and a very great man indeed. 
                         He is responsible for everything you 
                         see here. He built Shangri-La, taught 
                         our natives, and began our collection 
                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father 
                         Perrault.

                         Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I 
                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled 
                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. 
                         It was typical of the man that, one 
                         leg being frozen, and of course there 
                         being no doctors here, he amputated 
                         the leg himself.

                         Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had 
                         learned to understand their language, 
                         the natives told him he could have saved 
                         his leg. It would have healed without 
                         amputation.

                         Yes, yes. They were very sincere about 
                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect 
                         health is the rule here. They've never 
                         known anything different. So what was

                         be true for anyone else living here.

                         so in the case of Father Perrault himself. 
                         Do you know when he and the natives

                         Forgive me. I should have told you it 
                         is quite common here to live to a very 
                         ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain 
                         water, you might say. But we like to 
                         believe it is the absence of struggle 
                         in the way we live. In your countries, 
                         on the other hand, how often do you 
                         hear the expression, "He worried himself 
                         to death?" or, "This thing or that killed 
                         him?"

                         as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural 
                         death as by indirect suicide.

                         warily and continues to write.

                         It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway 
                         is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. 
                         He comes into the area where the horses 
                         are stabled. Two men are busily grooming 
                         the horses.

                         Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway?

                         Suddenly, Conway is startled by the 
                         sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, 
                         is in time to see 'the girl' of the 
                         previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him 
                         on a horse - screaming delightedly. 
                         As she passes him, she waves.

                         Well, I think I will take that ride!

                         Sondra whizzes by. As we stay on the 
                         shot - Conway rides through in exciting 
                         pursuit.

                         Showing Sondra disappearing behind a 
                         mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up, 
                         but she is lost from sight. He wheels 
                         around several times - and unable to 
                         find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving 
                         up, he starts slowly back. After a few 
                         moments he is startled by her laughter, 
                         and glances around.

                         up - near the summit of the hill - we 
                         see Sondra - waving and laughing. Then 
                         she swings her horse around and disappears.

                         As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently 
                         in the buff. From a distance, we see 
                         her climb onto a rock to dry off.

                         He has caught up to her tethered horse 
                         and is skulking around trying to find 
                         out where she is.

                         A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters 
                         excitedly.

                         She can apparently understand the squirrel's 
                         warning. She hurries to dive back into 
                         the water and swim to the other side. 
                         She comes up, spots Conway and watches 
                         him from hiding, behind some bushes.

                         Conway has discovered her clothing and 
                         is constructing a kind of scarecrow 
                         on a bush out of them. As a crowning 
                         touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, 
                         his eyes twinkling at his little joke. 
                         With one final glance over his shoulder, 
                         he turns to leave.

                         She stifles her laughter as he vanishes 
                         from view.

                         he is being made fun of, and gives a 
                         tentative chuckle.

                         George comes out of door to dining room

                         in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, 
                         a Cockney song.

                         you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately 
                         kidnapped and brought here - and nobody 
                         knows why
                                      
                         He rises to his feet.

                         I'm going to find out when we're going 
                         to get out of this place.

                         As George strides determinedly out into 
                         the hall, yelling.

                         Conway has caught up with him and wrestles 
                         him away from the servant, who stumbles 
                         off in fright.

                         George pushes Conway away from him and 
                         starts down the corridor.

                         George spies another servant.

                         The servant, frightened by his voice, 
                         turns suddenly and starts running. George 
                         levels his revolver and sends a stream 
                         of bullets after the fleeing servant, 
                         who miraculously manages to skate around 
                         a corner, unharmed. Conway runs into 
                         scene, reaching George, and with a quick 
                         flip of his left hand he smacks him 
                         over his revolver arm - and with his 
                         right, he punches him flush on the jaw.

                         Conway brings George in, followed by

                         bed. Conway stands by his side, looking 
                         down at him, deeply concerned. After

                         him.

                         (very quietly)
                                     
                         Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to 
                         us - and we appreciate it. But for some 
                         reason we are being held prisoners here, 
                         and we want to know why.

                         As Conway's voice continues, talking 
                         to Chang:

                         Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm 
                         enjoying every minute of it.

                         But my brother is not of the same opinion, 
                         nor are the others.

                         It's time we were told what it's all 
                         about.

                         Conway still continuing:

                         We want to know why we were kidnapped, 
                         why we are being kept here, but most 
                         important of all - do we get the porters, 
                         and when?
                                      
                         (much too suavely)
                                     
                         Until we get this information, my dear 
                         Mr. Chang, I am very much afraid we 
                         cannot permit you to leave this room.
 
                                                              
                         There is a pause while the eyes of all 
                         are centered on Chang's face.

                         a high state of expectancy. Conway is 
                         grim. They climb a narrow spiral staircase.

                         They proceed up the stairs until they 
                         arrive at a large, impressively ornate 
                         double door which seems to open automatically 
                         the moment they approach. Chang remains 
                         without. The moment Conway steps over 
                         the threshold, the doors swing closed.

                         As the doors swing shut. Conway turns 
                         and realizes Chang is no longer with

                         Conway stands still, glancing around 
                         the room, which is lit so dimly that 
                         nothing definite is distinguishable.

                         To show what Conway sees. For the moment, 
                         practically nothing. As his eyes become 
                         adjusted to the darkness, he begins 
                         to sense the architecture and furnishings 
                         of the room. But as yet no sign of life. 
                         SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained 
                         and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather 
                         simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries 
                         drape the back walls. While the CAMERA 
                         FOLLOWS CONWAY'S GAZE, MOVING SLOWLY 
                         AROUND, a voice is heard.

                         CAMERA QUICKLY SWINGS OVER to the nethermost 
                         corner of the room where, scarcely visible, 
                         sits an old man of indeterminate age. 
                         In the gloom only the outlines of his 
                         pale and wrinkled face can be seen. 
                         It yields an effect of a fading antique 
                         portrait.

                         vision.

                         stands within a few feet of the old 
                         man, his eyes riveted upon him.

                         I trust you have been comfortable at

                         Personally, I've enjoyed your community 
                         very much. But my friends do not care 
                         for this mystery. They are determined 
                         to leave as soon as
                                      
                         While he has been speaking, his eyes 
                         have been gradually taking in the details 
                         of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS 
                         HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against 
                         the man's throne - then, looking down, 
                         to his legs, one of which appears to 
                         have been amputated.

                         It's astonishing - and incredible, but

                         You may not know it, but I've been an 
                         admirer of yours for a great many years.
 
                                                              
                         Conway evinces surprise.

                         Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder 
                         and public hero. I wanted to meet the 
                         Conway who in one of his books, said, 
                         "There are moments in every man's life 
                         when he glimpses the eternal."
                                      
                         The quotation captures Conway's interest 
                         - and his eyes widen.

                         That Conway seemed to belong here. In 
                         fact, it was suggested that someone 
                         be sent to bring him here.

                         That I be brought here? Who had that 
                         brilliant idea?

                         Yes. She has read your books and has 
                         a profound admiration for you, as have

                         Of course I have suspected that our 
                         being here is no accident. Furthermore, 
                         I have a feeling that we're never supposed 
                         to leave. But that, for the moment, 
                         doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet 
                         that when it comes. What particularly 
                         interests me at present is, why was 
                         I brought here? What possible use can 
                         I be to an already thriving community?
 
                                                              
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         We need men like you here, to be sure 
                         that our community will continue to 
                         thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La 
                         has much to give you. You are still, 
                         by the world's standards, a youngish 
                         man. Yet in the normal course of existence, 
                         you can expect twenty or thirty years 
                         of gradually diminishing activity. Here, 
                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards 
                         your life has just begun, and may go 
                         on and on.

                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged 
                         future doesn't excite me. It would have 
                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted 
                         whether life itself has any. And if 
                         that is so, then long life must be even 
                         more pointless. No, I'd need a much 
                         more definite reason for going on and 
                         on.
                                      
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning 
                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to 
                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw 
                         all the nations strengthening, not in 
                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and 
                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single weaponed 
                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw 
                         a time when man, exulting in the technique 
                         of murder, would rage so hotly over 
                         the world that every book, every treasure, 
                         would be doomed to destruction. This 
                         vision was so vivid and so moving that 
                         I determined to gather together all 
                         the things of beauty and culture that 
                         I could and preserve them here against 
                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.
 
                                                              
                         (pause)
                                     
                         Look at the world today! Is there anything 
                         more pitiful? What madness there is, 
                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! 
                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity 
                         crashing headlong against each other, 
                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. 
                         The time must come, my friend, when 
                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by 
                         its own sword. Against that time is 
                         why I avoided death and am here, and 
                         why you were brought here. For when 
                         that day comes, the world must begin 
                         to look for a new life. And it is our 
                         hope that they may find it here. For 
                         here we shall be with their books

                         and their music and a way of life based 
                         on one simple rule: Be Kind.

                         When that day comes, it is our hope 
                         that the brotherly love of Shangri-La 
                         will spread throughout the world.

                         Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured 
                         each other, the Christian ethic may 
                         at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall 
                         inherit the earth.
                                      
                         A long silence ensues during which Conway, 
                         so engrossed is he in all he has just 
                         heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who 
                         has risen slowly and now stands before 
                         him. The Lama reaches down and gently 
                         touches him on the shoulder.

                         Conway kisses the High Lama's hand.

                         You must come again, my son. Good night.

                         Conway comes through. He walks as if 
                         in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he 
                         continues on his way - bearing an expression 
                         of deep absorption.

                         As Conway walks toward an open door 
                         at the end of corridor leading to the 
                         garden. Lovett emerges from one of the 
                         rooms and sees him. He beckons to those 
                         inside and almost immediately they come 
                         out and start toward Conway.

                         Conway stares at them blankly.

                         around him.

                         Shooting toward garden through open 
                         doorway. Conway walks away from the 
                         crowd in f.g., all staring at him, nonplussed. 
                         We see Conway walk through the garden 
                         in b.g. and disappear.

                         Of a pleasant and peaceful place. Conway 
                         is walking along moodily, drinking in 
                         the pastoral beauty.

                         As he walks along. He comes to a spot 
                         where a man and a woman are tilling 
                         the soil, and stops to watch them. The 
                         man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes 
                         a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway 
                         also bows. The woman curtsies prettily 
                         and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in 
                         acknowledgement.
                                      
                         He is in a cheerful frame of mind and 
                         continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING 
                         WITH HIM. He greets several other people. 
                         Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff 
                         their hats. Conway does likewise.

                         227. FULL SHOT
                                     
                         Conway is walking along a street in 
                         the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, 
                         unlike anything we have ever seen before. 
                         The small, one-story huts along its 
                         very narrow sidewalk are of singularly 
                         varied architecture - giving the impression 
                         of being "homemade." As a result of 
                         this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic 
                         about them is similar - their cleanliness. 
                         Something about the atmosphere is fresh 
                         and wholesome and peaceful. In front 
                         of several of the huts native women 
                         sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, 
                         some nursing babies, some asleep, and 
                         some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.

                         With Conway, walking along. As he passes, 
                         the women smile at him in the most friendly 
                         fashion. From inside these homes, soft 
                         and soothing music emanates. At the 
                         end of the street, Conway finally arrives 
                         at a garden spot. The suddenness of 
                         this is startling, too - because of 
                         its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway 
                         throws himself at the foot of an overhanging 
                         tree, and leans against the trunk.

                         He throws his head back, shuts his eyes 
                         - in a restful and contemplative mood. 
                         He remains this way quietly for a few 
                         seconds, when he is attracted by the 
                         singing of a chorus of children's voices. 
                         He glances around.

                         From Conway's angle. In the shadow of 
                         a row of overhanging trees which form 
                         an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty 
                         children sing a hymn, or nursery song 
                         - in English. Sondra (the violin girl 
                         of previous scenes) stands in front 
                         of them, a baton in hand, conducting 
                         them.

                         He smiles at the sight - and springing 
                         to his feet starts in their direction.

                         Of Sondra and the children, as Conway 
                         saunters into the scene behind her. 
                         He finds himself a comfortable place 
                         under a tree and sits down. The children, 
                         still singing, have seen his approach 
                         and crane their necks curiously.

                         She waves her baton and sings with the 
                         children. Then she notices they are 
                         being distracted and casually turns 
                         her head. She is somewhat startled at 
                         seeing Conway, but quickly recovers 
                         her composure, and smiles wanly.

                         To include Sondra, Conway and some of 
                         the children. They finish the song, 
                         and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies 
                         prettily. She turns to the children.

                         Good morning, Mr. Conway.

                         Conway scrambles to his feet and does 
                         an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.

                         She lifts her baton and the thin, piping 
                         voices fill the air.

                         He lights a cigarette and, leaning against 
                         a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed 
                         by her beauty.

                         She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious 
                         smile covers her face.

                         As a child from the ranks breaks and 
                         comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen 
                         to the child - who whispers in her ear. 
                         Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear" 
                         and still waving her baton is, for the 
                         moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning 
                         to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

                         Conway snaps out of his reverie and 
                         jumps forward.

                         He takes the baton from her.

                         And, taking the child by the hand, she 
                         exits.

                         Conducting the chorus in all seriousness 
                         - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns 
                         his head to watch Sondra, and when he 
                         looks forward again, finds himself off-beat. 
                         To cover his embarrassment, he smiles 
                         foolishly.

                         They come to the end of the song, but 
                         Conway, whose eyes are searching for 
                         Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues 
                         to conduct mechanically. The children 
                         break into laughter.

                         With Sondra as she returns with the 
                         child clinging to her. As she turns 
                         a bend, she looks up, surprised.

                         As she laughs heartily.

                         All right, children. Now teacher is 
                         going to be very busy this afternoon,

                         The children break into squeals and 
                         race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as 
                         they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff 
                         their clothes and with yelps and cries 
                         leap into a stream.

                         Of a large coop where pigeons are bred 
                         and raised. The pigeons flutter around, 
                         landing on Sondra and Conway, as she 
                         shows him her collection with pride. 
                         She grabs one pigeon and ties one of 
                         the miniature flutes to its legs.

                         And by varying the size of the flutes, 
                         I can get any notes I wish. The wind 
                         does the rest. Here's a little fellow

                         little boy whistling in the dark.

                         A little boy whistling in the dark!? 
                         Do you realize that there is a British 
                         cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring 
                         out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, 
                         waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London?

                         Does that look like a man whose life

                         Well, I was almost born here. It took 
                         place in that wild country beyond the 
                         pass. My father and mother were in a 
                         party of explorers who got lost and 
                         wandered around for a year. When Chang 
                         found us, only Father and I were alive. 
                         But he was too weak to climb the pass. 
                         He died on the way. I was brought up 
                         here by Father Perrault himself.

                         Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked 
                         to him last night.

                         And that in itself is confusing. I have 
                         the same idea about Shangri-La. The 
                         sense that I've been here before, that

                         Perhaps because you've always been a 
                         part of Shangri-La without knowing it.

                         a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's 
                         heart. I have never seen the outside

                         and millions of people who are supposed 
                         to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know 
                         that secretly they are all hoping to 
                         find a garden spot where there is peace 
                         and security, where there's beauty and 
                         comfort, where they wouldn't have to 
                         be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish 
                         the whole world might come to this valley.

                         They pass friendly natives and farmers 
                         at work.

                         I don't know why I associate with you, 
                         Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant 
                         - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your 
                         name may be.

                         Just call me Barney.

                         Barney? Why should I? Never! We have 
                         nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What 
                         effrontery!

                         And this trip to the valley. I can't 
                         imagine why I'd allow you to drag me 
                         down here. Why, we don't know anything 
                         about these people. We're not even armed!

                         They're very nice people - except that 
                         they've got horns.
                                      
                         LOVETT

                         Barnard points to sheepherders with 
                         their long horns.

                         Yeah. You know.

                         Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle, 
                         but still looks wary.

                         you.

                         Barnard has encountered some beautiful 
                         native girls, and they have surrounded 
                         him with their hospitality - plying 
                         him with wine and food. Lovett is off 
                         scene.

                         wine! Thanks very much.

                         This is fine. This is swell. No, just 
                         a drink. I've been walking and I'm a 
                         little thirsty, you see? That's all 
                         right. I don't just happen to be very 
                         hungry. Say look, all I asked for was 
                         a glass of water. Look here, I've got 
                         to have some help with this.

                         A merry Lovett has had too much to drink. 
                         Now he is entertaining a group of native 
                         children, who are huddled at his feet. 
                         Other natives watch the entertainment. 
                         Bernard, watching from one side, is 
                         losing patience.

                         then the bears came right into the 
                         bedroom and the little baby bear said, 
                         "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh 
                         dear, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed!" And then the big papa bear, he 
                         roared, "And somebody's been sleeping 
                         in my bed!" Well, you have to admit 
                         the poor little bears were in a quandary!

                         a place for himself, accumulate a nest 
                         egg, and so on.

                         It's the most annoying word in the English

                         her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? 
                         Because it isn't lady-like to do that. 
                         Why? Because that's what forks are made

                         of the garden, and past the fountain 
                         catches up with her. He reaches to place 
                         his hands around her neck.

                         You know, when we were on that plane, 
                         I was fascinated by the way its shadow 
                         followed it. That silly shadow racing 
                         along over mountains and valleys, covering 
                         ten times the distance of the plane. 
                         It was always there to greet us with 
                         outstretched arms when we landed. And 
                         I've been thinking that somehow you're 
                         that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. 
                         That all my life I've been rushing up 
                         and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing 
                         over obstacles, never dreaming that 
                         one day that beautiful thing in flight 
                         would land on this earth and into my 
                         arms.

                         we have here, I can put a plumbing system

                         Young? She arrived here in 1888. She 
                         was 20 at the time. She was on her way 
                         to join her betrothed - when her carriers 
                         lost their way in the mountains. The 
                         whole party would have perished but 
                         for meeting some of our people.

                         Amazing! She still doesn't look over 
                         20. When is she likely to grow old in 
                         appearance?

                         You've been lying to us ever since we 
                         got here! Apparently it's worked with 
                         some people. Perhaps it's because they 
                         lack the courage to do anything about 
                         it. But not me, Chang. You're up against 
                         the wrong man. I'll get out of here, 
                         if I have to blow this fantastic place 
                         into the valley! I'll get outporters

                         seen the faces of newcomers. I have 
                         looked into their eyes and heard their 
                         voices - always in hope that I might

                         You will preserve the fragrance of our

                         clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking 
                         its vast and legendary treasures. And 
                         they will all be here, my son, hidden 
                         behind the mountains in the Valley of

                         The voice of the Lama, toward the last, 
                         seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly 
                         engrossed, half-consciously waits for 
                         it to continue. Following a protracted 
                         silence, he slowly turns toward the 
                         Lama. A breeze blows through the room, 
                         ruffling curtains on the window.

                         From whose face the glow has faded. 
                         There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed 
                         mask.

                         He stares, uncertainly, for a long while, 
                         with a slow realization that the High 
                         Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he 
                         is being moved emotionally, tears well 
                         up in his eyes. While still sitting 
                         this way, unable to stir, he becomes 
                         conscious of activity around him.

                         As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive 
                         - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the 
                         Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, 
                         groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter 
                         softly and silently, and gather around 
                         the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable 
                         murmurs that might or might not be prayers. 
                         Conway is only vaguely aware of their 
                         presence - and after a few moments, 
                         scarcely conscious of what is actuating 
                         his movements, he drifts away from the 
                         murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction 
                         of the door.

                         Barnard and Gloria are on their knees 
                         on the floor. Before them they have 
                         spread a large map or chart. Barnard 
                         is enthusiastically out - lining his 
                         plans.

                         Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how 
                         to cast pipes out of clay.

                         get your things together. We're leaving.

                         are waiting for us on the plateau. And 
                         that Chinaman thought he could stop 
                         me. Come along.

                         I think I'll stick around. I'll leave 
                         with the porters on their next trip.

                         Hello.

                         Barney, I've just finished translating 
                         one of the most interesting old tablets 
                         you can imagine. It told me all about 
                         the origin of the Masonic symbols and
 
                                                              
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         That's swell, Lovey. I want to show 
                         you something. Look!
                                      
                         He proudly displays his map.

                         Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?

                         Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going 
                         to run pipes all through the village
 
                                                              
                         As all three heads go into a huddle.

                         Conway stands in front of a window - 
                         his arms extended across - peering out 
                         moodily. He is watching a solemn and 
                         slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers 
                         - the funeral rites of the High Lama 
                         - accompanied by cermonial music and 
                         drum-beating.
                                      
                         284. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         Shooting over his shoulder.
                                     
                         Getting his view of the magisterial 
                         procession.
                                      
                         285. CLOSE SHOT
                                     
                         Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the 
                         surroundings of which he has just become 
                         master.
                                      
                         286. CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR
                                     
                         George appears in the doorway. He looks 
                         around and espies Conway. For a moment 
                         he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (softly)
                                     
                         Bob
                                     
                         287. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces 
                         no emotion whatsoever.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (a murmur)
                                     
                         Hello, George.
                                     
                         George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's 
                         behavior is odd in view of their strained 
                         relationship.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, you can stop worrying about everything 
                         now, Bob. I've made arrangements to 
                         leave. If you'll let me close that window, 
                         I can talk to you. That noise is driving 
                         me crazy.
                                      
                         He closes the window.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         I said we're getting out of here. Back 
                         to civilization. I made a deal with 
                         the porters. They brought in a load 
                         of books or something, and they're leaving 
                         tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for 
                         us five miles outside the valley. Come 
                         on, get your things together. Where's 
                         your top coat?

                         You can't leave, George.

                         Why not? What's going to stop me?

                         You mustn't. You've got to stay here 
                         now.

                         What's the matter with you, Bob? You've 
                         been acting strangely ever since we 
                         came here.
                                      
                         (no response from Conway)
                                     
                         I've never seen you like this. Why can't 
                         we leave? What's stopping us?
                                      
                         Conway combats an impulse to tell him 
                         the whole story.

                         Something grand and beautiful, George. 
                         Something I've been searching for all 
                         my life. The answer to the confusion 
                         and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've 
                         found it, George, and I can't leave 
                         it. You mustn't either.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         I don't know what you're talking about. 
                         You're carrying around a secret that 
                         seems to be eating you up. If you'll 
                         only tell me about it.

                         I will, George. I want to tell you. 
                         I'll burst with it if I don't. It's 
                         weird and fantastical and sometimes 
                         unbelievable, but so beautiful!

                         Well, as you know, we were kidnapped 
                         and brought here . . .
                                      
                         While he is speaking, we slowly

                         As Conway is concluding his story.

                          . . . And that's the whole story, George. 
                         He died as peacefully as the passing 
                         of a cloud's shadow. His last words 
                         to me were, "I place in your hands, 
                         my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." 
                         Now you know why I can't leave.
                                      
                         George listens to him intently, his 
                         face a mask of apprehension. He stares 
                         at his brother for some time and finally 
                         rises and walks around for a few moments.

                         say. Except that you must be completely 
                         mad.

                         that don't happen today. We're living

                         I think you've been hypnotized by a 
                         lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, 
                         I wouldn't believe it if I heard it 
                         in an English monastery. Why should 
                         I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof?
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         I don't need any proof.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (contemptuously)
                                     
                         I knew there was a reason I hated this 
                         place. I'd give half my life to fly 
                         over it with a load of bombs just for 
                         what they've done to you. How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof? All this 
                         talk about the Lamas being hundreds 
                         of years old. How do you know? Did you 
                         see their birth certificates?
                                      
                         (some more pacing)
                                     
                         I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of 
                         decrepit old men sit around and dream 
                         about reforming the world. And you, 
                         Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground 
                         Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
 
                                                              
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Is that all my story meant to you?
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What else could it mean to me? It's 
                         obviously a lot of bunk.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Then you'd better go, George. This is 
                         no place for you.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         It's no place for you, Bob. Think of 
                         what's waiting for you. Do you want 
                         to stay here until you're half dead? 
                         Until your mind starts corroding like 
                         the rest of them?
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Please, George. I don't want to talk 
                         about it anymore.

                         You've got to talk about it. What about 
                         me? You said they stole that plane to 
                         bring you here. I didn't want to come. 
                         You owe me some responsibility.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         I'm tired of owing you things. You're 
                         free to go. Go ahead.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (suddenly)
                                     
                         It's that girl - that girl has twisted 
                         and turned

                         Enough! Never mind the girl!
                                     
                         (a tense moment of silence)
                                     
                         Well, why don't you go?
                                     
                         Conway has sunk into a chair. George 
                         kneels before him, pleading.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, 
                         you've looked after me. Now I think 
                         you're the one that needs looking after. 
                         I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something 
                         wrong with you, let me help you.

                         Oh, George . . .
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Besides, I - I don't feel like making 
                         that trip alone, Bob.

                         George, you couldn't possibly stay here, 
                         could you?
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         I'd go mad!

                         George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. 
                         But I believe in this, and I'm not going 
                         to lose it.

                         You know how much I want to help you, 
                         but this is bigger, stronger if you 
                         like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, 
                         George. I'm staying.

                         Well, I can't think of anything more 
                         to say. Goodbye, Bob.
                                      
                         They shake hands warmly. George turns 
                         to leave.

                         George, are you sure of the porters?

                         Conway looks his extreme amazement.

                         Because you can't. Do you know what

                         She's a fragile thing that can only 
                         live where fragile things are loved. 
                         Take her out of this valley and she'll 
                         fade away like an echo.

                         Favoring George. He laughs hollowly. 
                         He runs his hand through his hair. He 
                         stares unbelievingly at Conway.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         This would be funny - if it wasn't so 
                         pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over 
                         twenty!

                         You're wrong, George.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, 
                         she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know 
                         anyway.
                                      
                         (significantly)
                                     
                         I found out a lot of things last night.
 
                                                              
                         (quickly)
                                     
                         I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably 
                         one of the few decent things that's 
                         ever happened in this hellish place.

                         Conway stares at him.

                         So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? 
                         Nobody would ever think of leaving?

                         It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded 
                         with me ever since I came here to take 
                         her away from this awful place. She's 
                         cried in my arms for hours, for fear 
                         I'd leave her behind. And what's more, 
                         she's made two trips to the plateau 
                         to bribe the porters - for me!
                                      
                         CONWAY

                         I don't believe it! I don't believe 
                         a word of it!

                         All right. I'll prove it to you! You 
                         believe everything they've told you 
                         - without proof! I'll prove my story!
 
                                                              
                         As he speaks he has crossed to door 
                         leading to adjoining room. Conway's 
                         eyes are glued on him.

                         After a few seconds Maria appears in 
                         the doorway and stands there timidly.

                         Come in.
                                     
                         She steps forward.

                         I've got some bad news for you, Maria. 
                         My brother and I have decided we can't 
                         take you along.
                                      
                         Maria's face collapses.

                         MARIA
                                     
                         (small, frightened voice)
                                     
                         You can't take me?
                                     
                         She rushes to George and throws her 
                         arms around him.
                                      
                         MARIA
                                     
                         But you promised me! You promised to 
                         take me with you!
                                      
                         Over her shoulder George looks victoriously 
                         at Conway, who cannot believe his ears. 
                         Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway.
                                      
                         MARIA
                                     
                         It's all your fault! It was all arranged 
                         until he spoke to you! Why can't you 
                         leave us alone?

                         Do you mean to tell me you want to leave 
                         Shangri-La?
                                      
                         MARIA
                                     
                         I'll die if I have to stay here another 
                         minute! I've waited a long time for 
                         this chance to go, and you're not going 
                         to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go 
                         alone. It was I who bribed the porters. 
                         If it weren't for me, you'd never get 
                         out!

                         I thought the porters had instructions 
                         from the High Lama not to take anyone.

                         The High Lama? Who pays any attention 
                         to him? The porters laugh at the High 
                         Lama. All they want to know is how much 
                         gold he will give them. Well, I gave 
                         them more gold. I've been stealing it 
                         for a year. I'd do anything to get out 
                         of this place. To get away from that 
                         High Lama - the one who calls himself 
                         Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane 
                         for years!

                         Father Perrault is dead.
                                     
                         MARIA
                                     
                         He's dead? That's fine. You won't see 
                         me shedding any tears over him!

                         Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't

                         I thought so! He tells everyone I'm 
                         old. He wants them to stay away from 
                         me. He can't stand it when anyone comes 
                         near. He's punished me for every minute 
                         I've spent with George. If it weren't 
                         for him, I would have been out of here 
                         long ago, but he always stops me. Six 
                         months ago, I tried to escape and he 
                         locked me in a dark room. I nearly went 
                         crazy.

                         Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like 
                         an old woman? Is this the skin of an 
                         old woman? Look into my eyes and see 
                         if these are the eyes of an old woman?

                         it. She's lying.

                         You're lying. You're lying! Every word 
                         you've been saying is a lie! Come on, 
                         say it!
                                      
                         He has backed her into a corner and 
                         is nearly throttling her.

                         No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What 
                         reason could I have for lying? The chances 
                         are that we'll never come out of that 
                         horrible trip alive, but I'd rather 
                         die out there in a snowstorm and be 
                         buried alive, than to stay here one 
                         more minute now.
                                      
                         Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits

                         head - stares blankly for a moment.

                         out of the main building. The funeral

                         two men walk together, Maria behind. 
                         George is cheerful and buoyant.

                         with George.

                         Showing Conway, George and Maria - accompanied

                         He hesitates at the opening, looks back 
                         one more time. His eyes show confusion 
                         and defeat. George, ahead, calls out 
                         to him to hurry.

                         on the other side. She cries and weeps, 
                         calling out Conway's name, but he can 
                         no longer be seen.

                         Which should be a group of portraits 
                         - showing the group's seemingly impossible 
                         journey back to civilization. These 
                         pictures should be accompanied by music 
                         in the appropriate mood.

                         Accompanied by the porters, they trudge 
                         laboriously through snow-ridden plains.

                         The whole caravan are seen in the distance, 
                         clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted 
                         by ropes.

                         In the middle of a vast plain. They 
                         attempt to put up tents, which proves 
                         futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the 
                         canvas from its moorings.

                         The large group are seen lowering themselves 
                         in single file down a ledge alongside 
                         a ravine. The wind howls.

                         A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm 
                         swiping viciously across their faces. 
                         They edge their way pre-cautiously across 
                         a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses 
                         her bearings - slips - screams - and 
                         is caught by Conway just in time to 
                         save her from falling down the side 
                         of the jagged mountain.

                         Maria has one arm around George and

                         has her head down. They trudge silently. 
                         The porters are off in the distance, 
                         leaving them behind.

                         She stumbles and they help her up. George 
                         looks off toward the porters helplessly.

                         the cliff behind him - and his eyes 
                         become alert with an idea. His face 
                         lights up with great determination. 
                         He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks 
                         away, racing out of scene.
                                      
                         Conway turns sharply and is horrified.

                         A scattering of men are present - some

                         Several men are seated.

                         Here's Gainsford now.
                                     
                         They all look off.

                         From their view. We see Gainsford standing 
                         in the doorway, looking around. He spies 
                         them and starts forward.

                         As Gainsford shakes hands with them, 
                         and sits down.

                         He pushes on in front of him.

                         All this is said as Gainsford drains

                         Gentlemen, you see before you a very 
                         weary old man, who has just ended a 
                         chase that lasted nearly ten months.

                         up with him?

                         missing him by inches.

                         He was as determined as that to get 
                         back?

                         Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole 
                         course of my life, I have never encountered 
                         anything so grim. During these last 
                         ten months, that man has done the most 
                         astounding things. He learned how to 
                         fly, stole an army plane and got caught, 
                         put into jail, escaped . . . all in 
                         an amazingly short space of time. But 
                         this was only the beginning of his adventures.

                         He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing 
                         forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere 
                         I went, I heard the most amazing stories 
                         of the man's adventures. Positively 
                         astounding. Until eventually, I trailed 
                         him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

                         Of course he had already gone. But his 
                         memory - ah - his memory will live with 
                         those natives for the rest of their 
                         lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they 
                         called him. They'll never forget the 
                         devil-eyed stranger who six times tried 
                         to go over a mountain pass where no 
                         other human being dared to travel, and 
                         six times was forced back by the severest 
                         storms. They'll never forget the madman 
                         who stole their food and clothing - 
                         whom they locked up in their barracks 
                         - but who fought six of their guards 
                         to escape.

                         Why, their soldiers are still talking 
                         about their pursuit to overtake him, 
                         and shuddering at the memory. He led 
                         them the wildest chase through their 
                         own country, and finally he disappeared 
                         over that very mountain pass that they 
                         themselves dared not travel.

                         DISSOLVES TO:

                         MOVING IN FRONT OF CONWAY - as he walks 
                         forward with a steady step - his head 
                         held high - his eyes sparkling - snow 
                         pelting his face.
                                      
                         353. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         Over his silhouetted back.
                                     
                         As he walks away from the CAMERA, and 
                         we STAY WITH HIM a long time as he approaches 
                         a hill.
                                      
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         He has now ascended to the middle of 
                         the steep hill - his gait unchanged. 
                         THE CAMERA PANS UP to the summit of 
                         the incline - and we see that beyond 
                         it the horizon is filled with a strange 
                         warm light. Conway's figure - in silhouette 
                         - disappears over the hill - bells ring 
                         - and as the music begins to swell[16]
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.

 Bert:

 All right, ladies and gents,

 Comical poems suitable for the occasion, extemporized and thought up before your very eyes. All right, here we go.

 Room here for everyone gather around

 The constable's "responstable." Now, how does that sound?

 Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you.

 Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

 Hello, Andrew.

 Ah, Mrs. Cory a story for you.

 Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.

 Dear Miss Persimmon--

 
 Miss Persimmon:

 Yes?

 
 Bert:

 Wind's in the east, mist comin' in.

 Like something is brewin' about to begin

 Can't put me finger on what lies in store

 But I feel what's to happen, all happened before.

 I'm sorry. Where was I? Thank you, one and all, for your kind support. Ah, Miss Lark, thank you. Crikey. Bless you, guv. Generosity itself, that's what you are. No charge.

 Oh, it's you! Hello. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? All right. Come along with me. This here's Cherry Tree Lane. Nice little spot, you might say. Number 17's just down a bit. Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye, is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's Navy. Likes his house shipshape, he does, shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Time gun ready?

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Ready and charged, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Three minutes and six seconds.

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Bert:

 What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, admiral?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

 
 Bert:

 Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Enter that in the log.

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 A word of advice, young man: storm signals are up at number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

 
 Bert:

 Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned. Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Residence of George Banks, Esquire. Hello, hello, hello. The admiral's right. Heavy weather brewin' at number 17, and no mistake.

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Leave her alone!

 
 Ellen:

 Shut up!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature! Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance! I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

 
 Ellen:

 But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Her and her high and mighty ways! And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Indeed, Mrs. Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute, not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

 
 Ellen:

 No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Stand away from that door, my girl!

 
 Ellen:

 But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

 
 Ellen:

 They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I said my say, and that's all I'll say. I've done with this house forever.

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Well, hip, hip, hooray! And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

 
 Ellen:

 Now, now, Katie Nanna!

 Mrs. Banks! She's home!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And we'll sing in grateful chorus

 "Well done, Sister Suffragette"

 Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs. Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. You should've been there.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks, I would like a word with you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And Mrs. Ainslie, she was carried off to prison, singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 On, thank you, Katie Nanna. I always knew you were one of us.

 We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

 And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

 Though we adore men individually

 We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

 
 Katie nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Cast off the shackles of yesterday

 Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And they'll sing in grateful chorus

 "Well done, Sister Suffragette"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 From Kensington to Billingsgate

 One hears the restless cries

 From every corner of the land: womankind arise

 Political equality and equal rights with men

 Take heart for Mrs. Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

 No more the meek and mild subservients we

 We're fighting for our rights, militantly - never you fear

 
 Katie Nanna:

 If I may have a word, Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 So cast off the shackles of yesterday

 

 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And they'll sing in grateful chorus - "well done"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 "Well done"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 "Well done, Sister Suf--"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 What is it, Katie Nanna?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks, I have something to say to you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Where are the children?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 The children, madam, to be precise, are not here. They've disappeared again.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you. Doesn't it make the third time this week?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it. I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr. Banks say? He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing. Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr. Banks.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider. Think of the children. Think of Mr. Banks. He was just beginning to get used to you.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Posts, everyone! Four, three, two, one. Fire!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, I do beseech you--

 
 Katie Nanna:

 My wages, if you please.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Bit early tonight, aren't you, admiral?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual. How are things in the world of finance?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up. And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Good man.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 How do things look from where you stand?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Bit chancy, I'd say. The wind's coming up and the glass is falling. - don't like the look of it.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good, good, good.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather. Banks! Do you hear me?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Hmph!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What a very pretty hat.

 I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

 Much as a king astride his noble steed - thank you.

 When I return from daily strife, to hearth and wife

 How pleasant is the life I lead

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Dear, it's about the children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, yes, yes.

 I run my home precisely on schedule

 At 6:01 I march through my door

 My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

 Consistent is the life I lead

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, they're missing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Splendid. Splendid.

 It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

 King Edward's on the throne it's the age of men

 I'm the lord of my castle the sovereign, the liege

 I treat my subjects, servants children, wife with a firm but gentle hand, noblesse oblige

 It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

 Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

 And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed

 Ah, lordly is the life I lead

 Winifred, where are the children?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 They're not here, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't know, George

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You don't know?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

 Give me the police station, quickly, please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter--

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to boo-- oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear, only just.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What, uh-- yes. George Banks here. Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 The policeman's here, George!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, constable. Come in.

 
 Constable:

 Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Valuables?

 
 Constable:

 Come along, now. Come along.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Jane! Michael!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, please don't be emotional.

 
 Constable:

 Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Children, come here at once. Well?

 
 Jane:

 I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

 
 Constable:

 In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

 
 Jane:

 Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. Perhaps if you helped us to make one--

 
 Constable:

 Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters--

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

 
 Constable:

 Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

 
 Jane:

 Thank you, Constable.

 
 Constable:

 Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. Cook'll find me something. I never--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm awfully sorry about this, George. I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here? Me, that's who! They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here. They need a ruddy zookeeper.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna, I thought she would be firm with the children. She looked so solemn and cross.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'll try to do better next time.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months! And they've all been unqualified disasters.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I quite agree.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task. It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character. Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh, select the next person.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, would you, George?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Obviously the way to find a proper nanny, is to go about it in a proper fashion. I shall put an advertisement in The Times. Take this down please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, of course, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Wanted. Uh, no. Uh, required. Nanny: firm, respectable, no nonsense.

 A British nanny must be a general

 The future empire lies within her hands

 And so the person that we need

 To mold the breed

 Is a nanny who can give commands

 You getting this, Winifred?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

 A British bank is run with precision

 A British home requires nothing less

 Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

 Without them, disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

 In short you have a ghastly mess

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Splendid, George! Inspirational. The Times will be so pleased.

 
 Jane:

 Father?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes?

 
 Jane:

 We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about what we did today.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I should certainly think so.

 
 Jane:

 It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 It was indeed.

 
 Jane:

 And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

 
 Jane:

 We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Advertisement for what?

 
 Jane:

 For the new nanny.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You wrote an advert--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, I think we should listen.

 
 Jane:

 You said you wanted our help.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 But, I-- oh, very well.

 
 Jane:

 "Wanted: a nanny for two adorable children."

 
 Mr. Banks:

 "Adorable." well, that's debatable, I must say.

 
 Jane:

 If you want this choice position

 Have a cheery disposition

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane, I don't--

 
 Jane:

 Rosy cheeks, no warts

 
 Michael:

 That's the part I put in.

 
 Jane:

 Play games, all sorts

 You must be kind you must be witty

 Very sweet and fairly pretty

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of all the ridic-

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, please!

 
 Jane:

 Take us on outings give us treats

 Sing songs bring sweets

 Never be cross or cruel never give us castor oil or gruel

 Love us as a son and daughter

 And never smell of barley water

 
 Michael:

 I put that in, too.

 
 Jane:

 If you won't scold and dominate us

 We will never you give you cause to hate us

 We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

 Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

 Hurry, nanny

 Many thanks

 Sincerely

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Jane and Michael Banks

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you. Most interesting. And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please return to the nursery.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 They were only trying to help. They're just children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand. "Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever. Now is the time for action.

 Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 The Times? George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Time gun ready?

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Ready and charged, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 I'll take the report, Mr. Binnacle.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 The wind has changed, Sir. Seems to be comin' in from a new quarter.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 So it is.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Sir?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 What is it?

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

 
 Ellen:

 Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be. You see? Twelve seconds to go. Ten, nine, eight---

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Posts! Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, it is now 8:00.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 But I have told you time and time again, Ellen, I dislike being hurried into things.

 
 Jane:

 I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

 Michael, look!

 
 Michael:

 Perhaps it's a witch.

 
 Jane:

 Of course not. Witches have brooms.

 It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

 
 Michael:

 Rosy cheeks and everything.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. You may come in one at a time.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Ellen:

 Oh.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not? I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, well ye-- yes, of course, I mean. Uh-- you brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, I make it a point never to give references. A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now then, the qualifications. "Item one: a cheery disposition." I am never cross. "Item two: rosy cheeks." Obviously. "Item three: play games, all sorts." Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Excuse me. "Item four: you must be kind." I am kind, but extremely firm. Have you lost something?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ah! Yeah. That paper, you see. I thought that I--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are George Banks, are you not?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 George Banks.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well then.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I tore it up, turned it over. Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I hope not.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very obscure.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, we must indeed.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I shall require every second Tuesday off.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Every Tuesday.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 On second thoughts, I believe a trial period would be wise. Hmm. I'll give you one week. I'll know by then. I'll see the children now. Thank you.

 
 Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish. Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward. Spit spot!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George? Aah! George, what on earth are you doing? I thought you were interviewing nannies.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I was! I was!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 You mean you've selected one already?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, where is she?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Well, eh, she's in the nursery of course, I mean. I put her to work straightaway, I mean.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 How clever of you! I would have muddled the whole thing. Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, I - it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Will she be firm? Will she give commands? Will she mold our young breed?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You know, Winifred, I think she will. I think she will.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 In that case, perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?

 
 Ellen:

 Y-yes, sir?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

 
 Ellen:

 The others, sir?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, the others. How many n-nannies does she think we need in this house?

 
 Ellen:

 The position has been filled.

 
 Jane:

 I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

 
 Michael:

 That's a funny sort of bag.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Carpet.

 
 Michael:

 You mean to carry carpets in?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 No. Made of.

 
 Jane:

 This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Hmm. Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace. Still, it's clean. Yes, I think it will be quite suitable. Just needs a touch here and there. Well, first things first. I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand. Ah! This will never do! I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

 
 Michael:

 There-- but there was nothing in it.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Never judge things by their appearance. Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

 
 Michael:

 We better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky.

 
 Jane:

 She's wonderful.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Much better! Now, let me see. That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

 
 Michael:

 What?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 My tape measure.

 
 Michael:

 What do you want it for?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I want to see how you two measure up. Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere. Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is. Good. Come along, then. Quickly. Head up, Michael. Don't slouch. Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

 
 Michael:

 I am not!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 See for yourself.

 
 Michael:

 "Extremely stubborn and sus--"

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Suspicious.

 Now you, Jane. Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

 
 Michael:

 How 'bout you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well. Hold this for me. As I expected. "Mary Poppins. Practically perfect in every way."

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you. I've always liked it. Now, shall we get on with it?

 
 Jane:

 Get on with what?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

 
 Jane:

 Oh, yes!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well, then. Our first game is called "well begun is half done."

 
 Michael:

 I don't like the sound of that.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Otherwise entitled, "let's tidy up the nursery."

 
 Michael:

 I told you she was tricky.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Shall we begin?

 
 Jane:

 It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, it depends on your point of view. You see,

 In every job that must be done,

 There is an element of fun.

 You find the fun, and snap!

 The job's a game.

 And every task you undertake

 Becomes a piece of cake

 A lark, a spree it's very clear to see

 That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 In a most delightful way

 A robin feathering his nest

 Has very little time to rest

 While gathering his bits of twine and twig

 Though quite intent in his pursuit,

 He has a merry tune to toot

 He knows a song will move the job along

 For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 In a most delightful way

 The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

 Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

 Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

 And hence

 
 Reflection:

 And hence

 
 Mary Poppins:

 They find

 
 Reflection:

 They find

 
 Mary Poppins & Reflection:

 Their task is not a grind

 Mary Poppins:

 Cheeky.

 Don't be all day about it, please.

 
 Michael:

 Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, that was very--

 Thank you now-- when you've quite finished!

 Thank you. That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please. It's time for our outing in the park.

 
 Michael:

 I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please. Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like. Still, there's time. There's time. Spit spot! And off we go.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine

 Go down in the most delightful way

 
 Bert:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 I does what I likes and I likes what I do

 Hello, art lovers.

 Today I'm a screever and as you can see

 A screever's an artist of highest degree

 And it's all me own work

 From me own memory

 Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose. Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

 No remuneration do I ask of you

 But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

 Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

 Wait! Don't move. Don't move a muscle. Stay right where you are. I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

 
 Bert:

 Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

 
 Bert:

 To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins. Other nannies take children to the park. When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of. And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things begin to happen.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

 
 Bert:

 Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind, is a jolly holiday somewheres or other. Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised. "Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing. Here we go.

 The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers. World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats, of dexterity and skill before your very eyes. Ta-da! Ta-da!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

 
 Bert:

 Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside, as done by a true and lovin' hand. Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road and uh, over the hill.

 
 Michael:

 I don't see any road.

 
 Bert:

 What? No road? Just wants a bit of somethin' here, and a bit of somethin' there. There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

 
 Jane:

 Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please? Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

 
 Bert:

 Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Please, Mary Poppins. Please! Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

 
 Bert:

 All right, I'll do it myself.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do what?

 
 Bert:

 Bit of magic.

 
 Michael:

 A bit of magic?

 
 Bert:

 It's easy. Let's see. You think. You wink. You do a double blink. You close your eyes and jump.

 
 Jane:

 Is something 'sposed to happen?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Bert, what utter nonsense! Ohh! Why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple? Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch. One, two.

 
 Bert:

 Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do you really think so?

 
 Bert:

 Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You look fine, too, Bert.

 
 Michael:

 I thought you said there was a fair.

 
 Bert:

 So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

 
 Jane:

 Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

 
 Bert:

 Tell 'em Bert sent ya.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

 
 Bert:

 Ain't it a glorious day

 Right as a mornin' in May

 I feel like I could fly

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

 
 Bert:

 Have you ever seen

 The grass so green

 Or a bluer sky

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

 Mary makes your heart so light

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You haven't changed a bit, have you?

 
 Bert:

 When the day is gray and ordinary

 Mary makes the sun shine bright

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, honestly!

 
 Bert:

 Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

 The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

 When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are lightheaded.

 
 Bert:

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Animals:

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

 Mary makes your heart so light

 When the day is gray and ordinary

 Mary makes the sun shine bright

 Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

 The daffodils are smiling at the dove oink, oink.

 When Mary holds your hand

 You feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Turtles:

 Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

 Gentlemen like you are few

 
 Bert:

 A vanishing breed, that's me.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

 Underneath your blood is blue

 
 Bert:

 Common knowledge.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You'd never think of pressing your advantage

 Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed

 
 Bert:

 True.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 A lady needn't fear

 When you are near

 Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

 A jolly, jolly holiday with you

 
 Bert:

 Waiter! Waiter!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now then, what'd be nice?

 We'll start with raspberry ice

 and then some cakes and tea

 
 Waiter

 Order what you will

 There'll be no bill

 It's complimentary

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You're very kind.

 
 Waiter:

 Anything for you, Mary Poppins. You're our favorite person.

 
 Bert:

 Right you are.

 
 It's true that Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winnin'

 And Prudence and Gwendolyn set your hearts spinnin'

 Phoebe's delightful

 Maude is disarming

 
 Waiters:

 Janice Felicia Lydia

 
 Bert:

 .. charming

 Cynthia's dashing,

 Vivian's sweet,

 Stephanie's smashing

 Priscilla a treat

 
 Waiters:

 Veronica Millicent Agnes and Jane

 
 Bert:

 convivial company time and again

 Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts

 I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

 But cream of the crop

 Tip of the top

 
 Bert & Waiters:

 Is Mary Poppins

 And there we stop

 
 When Mary holds your hand

 You feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Michael:

 Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! -ya-hoo!

 
 Jane:

 Our own private merry-go-round.

 
 Bert

 Very nice. Very nice, indeed, if you don't wanna go nowhere.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Who says we're not going anywhere? Oh, guard!

 
 Guard:

 Righto, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Guard:

 They're off! It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths. Jane is second by a length. Michael third.

 
 Michael:

 My horse is the fastest.

 
 Bert:

 Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that? That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?

 
 Michael:

 Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Not so fast, please. Michael! Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.

 
 Bert:

 Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa! Whoa. Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa. Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.

 Follow me, please.

 Good morning.

 
 Hunter:

 Oh, yes, quite. Wha-- I say! Have you ever?

 
 Horse:

 Never!

 
 Hunter:

 View halloo!

 
 Horse:

 Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

 
 Fox:

 View halloo?

 Faith and begorra! 'Tis them redcoats again!

 
 Dogs:

 View halloo! View halloo! View halloo!

 
 Fox:

 Oh, musha, musha.

 
 Bert:

 Poor lit'l bloke. Let's give him a hand.

 
 Fox:

 Saints preserve us! Yikes!

 
 
 Tally ho!

 
 Bert:

 Da-doo, da-doo! Up you go. Now hang on.

 
 Fox:

 Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse. Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns. I can lick the lot of ya's. Faster, me beauty! Faster!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

 
 Horse Rider:

 Certainly, ma'am.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Horse Rider:

 Not at all, ma'am.

 
 Spectator 1:

 Excellent time, gentlemen.

 
 Spectator 2:

 Oh, yes, quite. - perfect day for it, of course.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh. Oh, how nice.

 
 Crowd:

 Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

 
 Photographer:

 Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

 
 Reporter 1:

 Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well I--

 
 Reporter 2:

 - gaining fame and fortune.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, yes.

 
 Reporter 3:

 Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

 
 Reporter 4:

 Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well, I wouldn't go--

 
 Reporter 3:

 There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please. On the contrary, there's a very good word. Am I right, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 Tell 'em what it is.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Right! It's ...

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Group:

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Bert:

 Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

 Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

 But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

 
 Bert & Mary Poppins:

 The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

 Oh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Group:

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Mary Poppins:

 He's traveled all around the world and everywhere he went

 He'd use his word and all would say, "there goes a clever gent"

 
 Bert:

 When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

 I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

 
 Bert & Mary Poppins:

 Ooh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know, you can say it backwards,

 Which is, Dociousaliexpiistic- fragilcalirupus.

 But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?

 
 Bert:

 Indubitably.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

 
 Bert:

 Hear, hear!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

 But better use it carefully or it could change your life

 
 Drummer:

 For example.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes?

 
 Drummer:

 One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

 Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too.

 
 Group:

 She's supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane! Michael! Stay close now. Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

 
 Bert:

 Well, there's more where they came from. Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Bye-bye.

 
 Jane:

 Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Bye. Bye, Jane and Michael.

 
 Michael:

 Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 La dum da da dum da da da da dum

 
 Michael:

 No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

 
 Jane:

 Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 People who get their feet wet, must learn to take their medicine.

 
 Michael:

 I don't want it. I'm not gonna--

 
 Jane:

 Oh! Lime cordial! Delicious!

 
 Michael:

 Strawberry! Mmm!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 R-r-rum punch. Quite satisfactory.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow? Mm-hmm.

 
 Michael:

 Will you stay if we promise to be good?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

 
 Jane:

 Whatever would we do without you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I shall stay until the wind changes.

 
 Michael:

 But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Did they?

 
 Jane:

 Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

 
 Michael:

 And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and--

 
 Jane:

 And we all went riding in the countryside!

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Tally ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Really?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

 
 Michael:

 But I saw you do it!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

 
 Michael:

 It did happen! I saw it!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Go to sleep.

 
 Michael:

 No, I don't want to go to sleep.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well, suit yourselves.

 Stay awake don't rest your head

 Don't lie down upon your bed

 While the moon drifts in the skies

 Stay awake don't close your eyes

 Though the world is fast asleep

 Though your pillow's soft and deep

 You're not sleepy as you seem

 Stay awake don't nod and dream

 Stay awake don't nod and dream

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Glorious day, Mr. Binnacle. Glorious! No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Shake things up a bit, what?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.

 
 Ellen:

 Indeed it is, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing street, to throw things at the prime minister. Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 It's cook singing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Is that so?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Really? Well, that is extraordinary.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And another thing. She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today--

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.

 
 Ellen:

 Thanks ever so, ducks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, stop making that offensive noise! And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. Quiet! You're giving the master a headache.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle. I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 
 Jane, Michael, Ellen & Mrs. Brill:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Stop! Stop! Stop!

 
 Jane:

 Good morning, Father.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good morning.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

 
 Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What on earth are you talking about? Supercali-- super-- or whatever the infernal thing is.

 
 Jane:

 It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

 
 Jane:

 Yes, father.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't think there's anything to explain, do you? It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning. The children just came in to make you feel better.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all. I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood. I don't require being made to feel better!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant. But I do expect a certain decorum. I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and-- there's something odd, I may say extremely odd about the behavior of this household since that woman arrived. And I want you to know that I've noticed it!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 One thing more.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I suggest you have this piano repaired. When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But, George, you don't play.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners. And then we go to Mrs. Cory's sh-- Mrs. Cory's shop for some gingerbread.

 
 Jane:

 Ah, gingerbread!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole and a pint of prawns. Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Ahoy, there! Ahoy! Good day to you!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Good morning, Admiral.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today? Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

 
 Michael:

 We're going to buy some fish.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

 
 Michael:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Let's put our backs into it, lad. More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

 
 Jane:

 It's Andrew!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying. Again? Och! Oh, the poor man! Bless you. Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway. And thank you very much.

 
 Jane:

 What did he say?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 He said, "you're welcome."

 
 Jane:

 What else did he say?

 
 Michael:

 I don't think he said anything.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know best, as usual.

 
 Jane:

 I thought we were gonna buy some fish.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 There's been a change of plans. Come along, please. Don't straggle.

 Andrew, worrying won't help anyone. Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

 Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.

 
 Bert:

 I came over the moment I heard.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, how is he?

 
 Bert:

 I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh!

 
 Bert:

 How about them? It's contagious, you know.

 
 Jane:

 Shall we get spots?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, highly unlikely.

 Oh, uncle Albert!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, bless me. Bless my soul. It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight-- -I'm delighted to see you, Mary.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uncle Albert, you promised!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, I kn-- I know, I-- but I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I-- but I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well-- and when I start, it's all up with the-- that's what happens to me. I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness! I can't help it. You can see that. I just like laughing, that's all.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse. It's really quite serious!

 
 Bert:

 Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face. Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 I love to laugh

 Loud and long and clear

 I love to laugh

 It's getting worse every year

 The more I laugh

 The more I fill with glee

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You're no help at all.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 The more the glee

 The more I'm a merrier me

 It's embarrassing.

 The more I'm a merrier me

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Some people laugh through their noses

 Sounding something like this -- dreadful!

 Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

 Hissing and fizzing like snakes

 Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

 
 Bert:

 Some laugh too fast

 Some only blast

 Others, they twitter like birds

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know, you're as bad as he is.

 
 Bert:

 Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

 
 Uncle Albert:

 When things strike me as funny I can't hide it inside

 And squeak as the squeakelers do

 I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

 And laugh too

 How nice! I was hoping you'd turn up.

 
 Bert:

 Turn up!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 We always have such a jolly time.

 
 Uncle Albert & Bert:

 We love to laugh

 Loud and long and clear

 We love to laugh

 So everybody can hear

 The more you laugh

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

 
 Uncle Albert & Bert:

 The more you fill with glee

 The more the glee

 The more we're a merrier we

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

 
 Bert:

 That's right. Pull up a chair.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, pull up--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

 
 Bert:

 Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother. He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 In a watch factory? What does he do?

 
 Bert:

 He stands about all day and makes faces!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 He makes faces in a watch fact-- you made that up.

 
 Bert:

 I know.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 That's so good!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Such behaviour! Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

 
 Bert:

 Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 What's the name of his other leg? Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, then, children, it's time for tea. I will not have my schedule interrupted.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And it's getting cold!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that-- splendid! Thank you very much! Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

 
 Bert:

 I knew she could bring it off. And a proper tea it is, too.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out. Oh, well. If I must, I must. If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas! Two lumps, uncle Albert?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes, please.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

 
 Jane:

 I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

 
 Bert:

 Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather, the other day when it was so cold, a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know. The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?" and my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane! Control yourself! Children, will you please sit up properly at the table? Your tea, uncle Albert.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, thank you, my dear. I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

 
 Michael:

 We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, no, there is a way. Frankly I, I don't like to mention it, because you have to think of something sad.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Then do get on with it, please!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Let me see. I've got the very thing. Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there. And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that's sad.

 
 Michael:

 The poor cat.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat." and the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

 Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do. But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't-- I can't help--

 Mary Poppins:

 That will be quite enough of that! It's time to go home.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that is sad.

 
 Michael:

 Oh, no!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Spit spot!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Must you really go? You know, people come to see me all the time, you know. And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home. And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

 
 Michael:

 Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

 
 Jane:

 We had a lovely time.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, keep an eye on uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 I'll sit with him a while.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you. Come on.

 
 Bert:

 Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion. Would you like to hear it?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 I'd be so grateful.

 
 Bert:

 Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see? And one night, he had a nightmare, he did. So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits. Yes. To bits.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 Next morning I says, "How do you feel, granddad?"

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

 Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That-

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks? I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks? Banks!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!

 
 Michael:

 Want to hear a joke?

 
 Jane:

 We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

 
 Michael:

 Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this. I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

 
 Michael:

 And there was a second chap, and the second chap says, "What's the name of his other leg?"

 
 Jane:

 And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, children, please be quiet.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she? Will you please return to your room. Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 As you wish.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm afraid there is.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, yes, George, of course.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

 
 Ellen:

 She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else! But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But, George, they're only children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Precisely. And in the light of what has happened--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I believe I do, Winifred.

 A British bank is run with precision

 A British home requires nothing less

 Tradition, discipline and rules

 Must be the tools

 Without them disorder, chaos, moral disintegration

 In short you have a ghastly mess

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I quite agree.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The children must be molded shaped and taught

 That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

 In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting. Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much. At any rate, it's traditional. But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you. Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable outings of every other kind!

 If they must go on outings

 These outings ought to be

 Fraught with purpose yes, and practicality

 These silly words like

 Superca-- super-- superca-

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well done. You said it.

 And popping through pictures

 Have little use, fulfill no basic need

 They've got to learn the honest truth

 Despite their youth

 They must learn

 
 Mary Poppins:

 About the life you lead

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Exactly.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

 A thousand ciphers neatly in a row

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Quite right.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

 Their little cup of joy should overflow

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Precisely!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps

 
 Mr. Banks:

 My footsteps.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To tread your straight and narrow path with pride

 
 Mr. Banks:

 With pride.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Tomorrow just as you suggest

 Pressed and dressed

 Jane and Michael will be at your side

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Splendid! You hit the nail right on the-- at my side? Where are we going?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I proposed?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Of course. Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children. I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 It certainly sounded that way, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh. And why not? A capital idea! Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary female thinking they get around here all day long. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Go? What on earth are you talking about?

 
 Michael:

 Didn't you get sacked?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Sacked? Certainly not! I am never sacked!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Mary Poppins!

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Hurrah, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Neither am I a Maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

 
 Michael:

 But?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Goats butt, birds fly, and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep. Come along, please.

 
 Jane:

 An outing with father?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes.

 
 Michael:

 I don't believe it.

 
 Jane:

 He's never taken us on an outing before.

 
 Michael:

 He's never taken us anywhere.

 
 Jane:

 However did you manage it?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Manage what?

 
 Jane:

 You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 What an impertinent thing to say! Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

 
 Jane:

 Where's he taking us?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To the bank.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and father can point them out to us.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, most things he can. But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose.

 
 Jane:

 Past the end of his nose?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

 
 Michael:

 Oh, look! The cathedral.

 
 Jane:

 Father passes that every day. He sees that.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Early each day to the steps of St. Paul's

 The little old bird woman comes

 In her own special way to the people she calls

 Come buy my bags full of crumbs

 Come feed the little birds show them you care

 And you'll be glad if you do

 Their young ones are hungry

 Their nests are so bare

 All it takes is tuppence from you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 Feed the birds that's what she cries

 While overhead her birds fill the skies

 All around the cathedral

 The saints and apostles

 Look down as she sells her wares

 Although you can't see it

 You know they are smiling

 Each time someone shows that he cares

 Though her words are simple and few

 Listen, listen she's calling to you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 Though her words are simple and few

 Listen, listen she's calling to you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

 
 Michael:

 But I thought it was your bank.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers, so in a sense it is, sort of.

 
 Jane:

 Michael, look! It's her!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Who? It's who?

 
 Jane:

 The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be. You do see her, don't you, Father?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of course I can see her. Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

 
 Jane:

 Listen, Father, she's saying it.

 
 Birdwoman:

 Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

 
 Jane:

 Please may we feed the birds?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Whatever for?

 
 Michael:

 I have tuppence from my money box.

 
 Jane:

 Just this once, please?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

 
 Jane:

 But Mary Poppins-

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says. Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

 
 Michael:

 But it's my tuppence!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away! When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence. And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 These are my children, Mr. Dawes.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Well, so I assumed. But why are they here?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 They wish to open an account, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, indeed?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 And just how much money do you have, young man?

 
 Michael:

 Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Tuppence? Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr. Dawes. A giant in the world of finance.

 
 Michael:

 A giant?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Shh, shh, shh.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, Father, these are Banks's children. They want to open an account.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Oh, they do, do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent. We can al-always use, al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

 So, you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it?

 
 Michael:

 No. I want it to feed the birds!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

 But if you invest your tuppence

 Wisely in the bank

 Safe and sound

 Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

 Will compound

 And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

 As your affluence expands

 In the hands of the directors

 Who invest as propriety demands

 
 Mr. Banks:

 May I, sir?

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Carry on, Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

 Railways through Africa

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Exactly!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Dams across the Nile

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 The ships. Tell them about the ships.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Fleets of ocean Greyhounds

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 More, tell them more!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Majestic self-amortizing canals

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Oh, it fires the imagination!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Plantations of ripening tea all from

 
 Bank Directors:

 Tuppence prudently thriftily, frugally

 Invested in the

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 To be specific

 
 Bank Directors:

 In the Dawes, Tomes Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Very well, my boy, give me the money.

 
 Michael:

 No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

 When you deposit tuppence in a bank account

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Go on!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Soon you'll see

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Tell him more!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 That it blooms into credit of a generous amount semi-annually

 
 Bank Directors:

 And you'll achieve that sense of stature

 As your influence expands

 To the high financial strata

 That established credit now commands

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr) & Directors::

 You can purchase first and second trust deeds. Think of the foreclosures! Bonds, chattels, dividends, shares. Bankruptcies. Debtor sales. Opportunities. All manner of private enterprise. Shipyards. The mercantile. Collieries. Tanneries. Corporations. Amalgamations.

 Banks!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 While stand the banks of England, England stands. Oh, oh, oh, oh! When fall the banks of England, England falls!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

 
 Bank Directors:

 Tuppence patiently, cautiously trustingly invested in the

 To be specific in the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

 

 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Welcome to our joyful family of investors.

 
 Michael:

 Give it back! Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, behave.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks!

 
 Michael:

 Give it to me!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, behave.

 
 Michael:

 Jane! Jane! Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane! Michael! Michael! Michael!

 
 Michael:

 Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael!

 
 Client 1:

 There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

 
 Client 2:

 Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along, young man! I want every penny!

 
 Client 3:

 And mine, too!

 
 Client 4:

 And give me mine, too!

 
 Banker:

 Stop all payments. Stop all payments.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael! Jane!

 
 Michael:

 Give me my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Children, come back here.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Stop those children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane! Michael!

 
 Micheal:

 Gimme my money back! I want my money! Come on.

 
 Director:

 Stop those children! Stop those children!

 
 Old Woman:

 Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you!

 
 Bert:

 Here, here, half a mo.

 
 Michael:

 Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

 
 Bert:

 Easy, now. Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya.

 
 Jane:

 Bert, it's you!

 
 Bert:

 In the flesh, and at your service.

 
 Michael:

 You're filthy!

 
 Bert:

 Oh, perhaps a smudge or two. It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

 
 Bert:

 Now, now, don't take on so. Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father. Now, who's after you?

 
 Jane:

 Father is.

 
 Bert:

 What?

 
 Michael:

 He brought us to see his bank.

 
 Bert:

 I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

 
 Michael:

 He sent the police after us, and the army and everything.

 
 Jane:

 Michael, don't exaggerate.

 
 Bert:

 Well, now, there must be some mistake. Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

 
 Jane:

 I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

 
 Michael:

 He doesn't like us at all.

 
 Bert:

 Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

 
 Jane:

 It's true.

 
 Bert:

 Let's sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

 
 Jane:

 Father in a cage?

 
 Bert:

 They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

 
 Jane:

 Father's not in trouble. We are.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

 
 Michael:

 He's not very silent!

 
 Jane:

 Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

 
 Bert:

 Well, not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on, I'll take you home.

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 Or blow me a kiss and that's lucky too

 Now as the ladder of life has been strung

 You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

 Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

 In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 
 Bert & Children:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away. I'm dreadfully late!

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Bert:

 Well, I'll be gettin' along now.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, please stay 'til father comes home. He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

 
 Ellen:

 It's the children, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, I thought they were with their father. You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am. They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will. Oh, no, it's her day off! Ellen, I wonder if you would--

 
 Ellen:

 No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, will you ask Mrs. Brill?

 
 Ellen:

 Not for a hundred quid, ma'am. This here is baking day, and you know how cook is!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 What about you, sir? You've been so kind in looking after the children.

 
 Bert:

 Wh-- uh, me, ma'am? W-well, well, I-I-I have to be moving along. The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Chimney. How clever of you to know. Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

 
 Bert:

 W-w--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Thank you so much!

 
 Bert:

 But--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Besides, it'll amuse the children.

 
 Bert:

 The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it. I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song! Good-bye, my darlings. See you soon.

 
 Bert:

 I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

 A broom for the shaft

 And a brush for the flue

 
 Jane:

 Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

 
 Bert:

 There now. You see how wrong people can be? That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

 Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

 'Tween pavement and stars

 Is the chimney sweep world

 When there's hardly no day

 Nor hardly no night

 There's things half in shadow

 And halfway in light

 On the rooftops of London

 Coo, what a sight.

 
 Jane:

 I do wish we could go up there.

 
 Michael:

 So do I! I like chimneys.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing. She's built tall right up there on the roof. When the wind is just right, it blows across her top, then draws the smoke right up the flue. Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush. It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it? Michael,

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace. Oh, bother!

 
 Jane:

 Michael! Michael, come back down here. Michael! Michael, where are you?

 
 Bert:

 Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads! There goes the other one.

 
 Bert:

 Shall I go after 'em?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

 
 Jane:

 Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Will you put your things on at once? Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

 
 Bert:

 Here you are! I thought you'd left us.

 
 Jane:

 We didn't mean to.

 
 Bert:

 Well, no harm done. The truth is, this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance. Look there. A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored. Why not, Mary Poppins?

 
 Jane:

 Oh, please, Mary Poppins?

 
 Michael:

 Please!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well. If we must, we must. Fall in. Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it! Get in line. Attention! A-show arms! A-right turn! Quick march!

 
 Michael:

 Hello there!

 
 Bert:

 It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

 
 Bert:

 As far as we go, right?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Not at all.

 
 Bert:

 What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet. And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air. Follow me, please.

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim

 Mary Poppins, step in time! There you go, Mary Poppins! Lucky old Bert! Come on, Mary Poppins! Here we go, mate! Here we go! Make room for her! Go! Ain't she marvelous? Ain't she beautiful? Lovely. Tell your mum! Hello, hello, hello! More! More! Mary, do it again! Come on, Mary, do it again. Here we go.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 We're being attacked by Hottentots!

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Cheeky devils! Give 'em what for! Empty the shot lockers!

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir!

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Move along, Mr. Binnacle. Handsomely now. Teach the beggars a lesson.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Gun ready, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Stand by. Fire!

 Fire! Well hit, sir! Very well hit!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Aah! They're at it again!

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 They're at it again!

 Step it time,

 At it again

 Step in time

 They're at it again

 Step it time ow!

 Ow,

 Ow,

 Step in time

 Never need a reason never need a rhyme

 Whoa!

 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, Ellen, when you have a second.

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 Votes for women, step in time

 Votes for women, step in time

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, no, really, not at the moment.

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 Votes for women

 Votes for women!

 
 Ellen:

 It's the master!

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 It's the master,

 Step in time

 It's the master, step in time

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What's all this?

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 What's all this

 What's all this?

 What's all this

 Link your elbows, step in time

 What's all this?

 Kick your knees up what's all this?

 Step in time

 Kick your knees up

 Kick your knees up Bert.

 Kick your knees up

 Kick your knees up in time

 
 Good luck, guv'nor. Lovely time! Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

 
 Michael:

 Good luck, guv'nor.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand. You're going to be the luckiest person in the world!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Spit spot.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Just a moment, Mary Poppins. What is the meaning of this outrage?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I beg your pardon?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Will you be good enough to explain all this?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I never explain anything.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes. Banks here. Mr. Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today. I can assure you that-- tonight, sir?

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Without fail.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Without fail.

 
 Why, yes, Banks. It's extremely serious.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 We regret this course of action.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 We regret this course of action.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 After all, you have been with us a good many years.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 After all, you have been with us a good many years.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 As was your father before you.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 As was your father before you.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, Mr. Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

 A man has dreams of walking with giants.

 To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

 Before the mortar of his zeal

 Has a chance to congeal

 The cup is dashed from his lips!

 The flame is snuffed a-borning.

 He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

 
 Bert:

 Life is a rum go, guv'nor, and that's the truth.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You know what I think? It's that woman Mary Poppins. From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

 
 Bert:

 Mary Poppins?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, yes, of course.

 My world was calm, well-ordered, exemplary.

 Then came this person with chaos in her wake

 And now my life's ambitions go

 With one fell blow

 It's quite a bitter pill to take.

 It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

 
 Bert:

 I know the very person you mean. Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

 A spoonful of sugar that is all it takes

 It changes bread and water into tea and cakes

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see? That's exactly what I mean! Changing bread and water into tea and cakes!

 
 Bert:

 Indeed!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

 
 Bert:

 A spoonful of sugar goes a long, long way

 Have yourself a healthy helpin' everyday

 An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Do you know what she did? I realize it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank. That's how all the trouble started.

 
 Bert:

 Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 Outrageous! A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful! You're a man of high position. Esteemed by your peers.

 And when your little tykes are cryin' you haven't time to dry their tears

 and see them grateful little faces smilin' up at you

 because their dad he always knows just what to do

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca-- -

 
 Bert:

 Like you say, guv'nor.

 You've got to grind, grind, grind at that grindstone

 Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve

 And all too soon they've up and grown

 And then they've flown

 And it's too late for you to give

 Just that spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Well, good-bye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

 
 Jane:

 Father? We're sorry about the tuppence. We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

 
 Michael:

 Here, father, you can have the tuppence.

 
 Jane:

 Will that make everything all right?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Come in!

 Take your hat off, Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good evening, gentlemen.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Well, get on with it. Go on.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, yes, Father. In 1773, an official of this bank, unwisely loaned a large sum of money, to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies. Do you know what happened?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do. Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston harbor, uh, a party of the colonists dressed as Red Indians, uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard. This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Precisely. The loan was defaulted. Panic ensued within these walls. There was a run on the bank!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 From that time to this, sir, there has not been a run on this bank until today! A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son. Do you deny it?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I do not deny it, sir. And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What are you waiting for? Get on with it!

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, y-yes, Father.

 
 Director 1:

 No, not that!

 
 Director 2:

 Steady on.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, sir, they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say I-

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Just one word, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Yes?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious. Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually. Do you know what there's no such thing as? It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done, that there's no such thing as you!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Impertinence, sir!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Speaking of impertinence, would you like to hear a perfectly marvelous joke? A real snapper!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Joke? Snapper?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael. And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael, "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith." and Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful, Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious tuppence. Guard it well. Good-bye!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks, where are you going?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture, and go for an outing in the country. Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the derby! Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Poppins?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

 A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 The medicine--

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Mad as a march hare.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden le--

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Father? Father! Father, come down! Daddy! Daddy, come back!

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

 
 Michael:

 She doesn't care what happens to us.

 
 Jane:

 She only promised to stay 'til the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And what would happen to me, may I ask, if I loved all the children I said good-bye to?

 
 Constable:

 Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. About six foot one, I'd say, sir. Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning. The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night. No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

 
 Ellen:

 Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river. There's a nice spot there by Suffolk bridge. Popular with jumpers.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Really, Ellen!

 
 Constable:

 He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir. No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean. Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 It's him!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Helps the medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Or something that sounds like him.

 
 Constable:

 Mrs. Banks, could we have a little less noise on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 In the most delightful way

 Just a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George! Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river. How sensible of you.

 
 Constable:

 It's all right, sir. He's been found! No, alive! Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

 A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Dotty as you please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Your father's calling you.

 
 Michael:

 It doesn't sound like Father.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane? Michael?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Run along. Spit spot!

 
 Michael:

 You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Spit spot.

 
 Michael:

 He mended it!

 
 Jane:

 It's wonderful! However did you manage it?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 With tuppence for paper and strings

 You can have your own set of wings

 With your feet on the ground

 You're a bird in flight

 With your fist holding tight

 To the string of your kite

 Oh, oh, oh

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite

 And send it soaring

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

 
 Constable:

 That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite! Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

 
 Banks Family:

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Bert:

 When you send it flying up there

 All at once you're lighter than air

 You can dance on the breeze

 Over houses and trees

 With your fist holding tight

 To the string of your kite

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Oh, oh, oh 

 
 Michael:

 Now!

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, there you are, Banks. I want to congratulate you. Capital bit of humor. Wooden leg named Smith. Or Jones or whatever it was. Father died laughing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about. Never seen him happier in his life. He left an opening for a new partner. Congratulations.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you, sir. Thank you very much indeed, sir.

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Umbrella:

 That's gratitude for you. Didn't even say good-bye.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 No, they didn't.

 
 Umbrella:

 Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 That's as it should be.

 
 Umbrella:

 Well, don't you care?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

 
 Umbrella:

 Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, really?

 
 Umbrella:

 Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children. And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

 
 Bert:

 Good-bye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.
